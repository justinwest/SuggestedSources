Extent of the problem

1. Scale of exposure  
   • Systematic studies find that items labelled “fake news” made up only about 0.15 % of the average American’s 2016 online news diet, and more than 90 % of citizens saw none at all; consumption was highly concentrated among a small, older, conservative minority [1].  
   • Russian‐IRA tweets reached “practically no one”; an average user was exposed to roughly one such tweet per month during the 2016 campaign [1].

2. Impact on beliefs and behaviour  
   • When exposure does occur, effects are modest. Meta-analyses of persuasion experiments (including those that study misinformation, campaign ads and canvassing) find average effect sizes close to zero; the blog summarises this as “one in twenty people or fewer change their mind after a persuasive treatment” [1].  
   • Most people who encounter false claims already hold congruent partisan views; the misinformation therefore “preaches to the choir” instead of converting large numbers of citizens [1].  
   • Corrective information, while not a panacea, frequently reduces misperceptions and the infamous “backfire effect” is “rare to non-existent” in large replications [1].

3. Trend over time  
   • Contrary to the popular narrative, there is no clear evidence that belief in political falsehoods is rising. In longitudinal surveys the prevalence of misperceptions has remained flat or fallen since 2010 [1].

4. Where the genuine risks lie  
   • A small subset of heavy consumers can nevertheless suffer serious harm (e.g., anti-vaccine communities, extremist milieus) and can be politically mobilised; the problem is therefore “real but niche” [1].  
   • Structural forces—partisan media ecosystems, elite cueing, declining local news—likely matter more for democratic dysfunction than isolated pieces of misinformation, yet they receive less attention [1].

5. Why the danger is easily exaggerated  
   • Shocking falsehoods are highly shareable and thus over-represented in journalists’ social-media feeds; this fosters a perception that “everything online is fake” [1].  
   • The moral panic around misinformation can encourage poorly targeted interventions (indiscriminate content removal, excessive fact-checking mandates) while diverting resources from broader media, civic and institutional reforms [1].

Conclusion  
Misinformation is not a negligible issue—certain communities are intensely exposed and specific false claims (e.g., about public health) can do real damage. Nevertheless, the best available evidence reviewed in the source indicates that, for the average citizen, exposure is rare and persuasive impact is small. The main democratic hazards stem from deeper partisan and media-system dynamics rather than from a flood of viral falsehoods [1].
