Summary
- UK: A court has rejected Wikipedia’s attempt to avoid “verification” duties under the UK Online Safety Act (OSA), meaning the encyclopedia will need to comply with Ofcom’s forthcoming rules for large platforms on offering users an option to verify their accounts and to filter interactions accordingly [1]. Ofcom’s guidance says verification does not have to mean revealing real-world identity and should be proportionate and privacy-preserving [3]. The Wikimedia movement and digital rights groups warn such systems can chill anonymous participation and harm community-governed projects [1][4].
- EU: In parallel, the EU’s pending “Chat Control”/CSAM Regulation would enable state-issued “detection orders” that can force services to scan users’ private communications for child sexual abuse material (potentially including client-side scanning), which opponents argue would undermine end‑to‑end encryption and create mass surveillance risks [2][5][6]. Civil-society groups, technologists, and data-protection authorities have urged major changes or withdrawal [2][6].

What the UK ruling changes (and what it doesn’t)
- Verification duty scope: Under the OSA, the largest “Category 1” services must give adult users a way to verify their accounts and must provide tools so people can limit interactions (e.g., replies, messages, visibility) to verified users only. The law does not mandate real-name identity checks; it allows privacy-preserving methods (e.g., reputation-based or third‑party attestations) and expects proportionate, risk-based implementation [3].  
- Wikipedia’s challenge: Wikipedia argued that such a duty conflicts with its model of pseudonymous editing and community moderation. The BBC reports that Wikipedia (Wikimedia Foundation) lost its challenge and will be expected to comply with Ofcom’s rules [1].  
- Practical implications for Wikipedia:  
  - Product work will likely be needed to offer an optional verification pathway and to expose filters that let users prefer interactions with “verified” accounts.  
  - Verification need not disclose real identity (Ofcom’s guidance emphasizes privacy-preserving methods), but any visible “verified” tier risks creating a two‑class system that could deter newcomers, reduce anonymous/pseudonymous participation, and complicate volunteer moderation [3][4].  
  - Ofcom emphasizes proportionality, which may give room for designs that fit community-governed projects without imposing ID checks, but details will matter during implementation and compliance reviews [3].  
- What it doesn’t do: The verification duty is separate from age checks for pornographic services and does not by itself require age verification for access to Wikipedia’s content; Ofcom has also said “verification” must not necessarily involve identity disclosure [3].

The EU “Chat Control” proposal in context
- Core idea: The European Commission’s draft CSAM Regulation would allow authorities to issue “detection orders” compelling providers to detect known or new CSAM, and sometimes grooming, in user communications. Depending on the service, this could amount to scanning private messages and could entail client‑side scanning on end‑to‑end encrypted (E2EE) services [5].  
- Why it’s controversial:  
  - Encryption: Security researchers and providers warn that mandated scanning—especially on E2EE services—requires weakening encryption or installing scanning code on user devices, creating systemic risks and surveillance capabilities [2].  
  - Fundamental rights: The European Data Protection Board and European Data Protection Supervisor jointly warned the proposal, as drafted, risks disproportionate interference with privacy, data protection, and freedom of expression, urging strict targeting and safeguards and rejecting general monitoring [6].  
- State of play: As of late 2024, the file remained highly contested in Council and Parliament, with multiple governments seeking stronger guarantees for encryption or opposing blanket scanning. Negotiations have continued without a final, widely accepted compromise [5][6]. Civil-society campaigns (including Fight Chat Control) advocate rejecting detection mandates that would undermine E2EE [2].

How these tracks intersect
- Shared intent, divergent tools: Both the UK OSA and the EU CSAM plan aim to reduce online harms, especially abuse of children. The UK’s “user verification” duty targets abusive anonymity dynamics on large platforms; the EU CSAM plan targets distribution of illegal content via scanning mandates.  
- Rights risks:  
  - UK verification features, if poorly designed, could chill speech and participation by anonymous/pseudonymous contributors and create discrimination against unverified users, even if identity isn’t required [1][3][4].  
  - EU detection orders could compel scanning of private communications and weaken E2EE, with broad collateral risks to journalists, activists, and ordinary users’ security [2][6].  
- Governance takeaway: Proportionate, rights‑preserving safety measures require narrow scoping, independent oversight, transparency, and technical designs that do not erode core protections like anonymity in knowledge projects or the integrity of end‑to‑end encryption.

What to watch next
- Ofcom’s final codes and guidance: Details on verification methods deemed acceptable, “proportionate” implementation for non‑profits, and timelines for Category 1 services (including Wikipedia) to comply [3].  
- Wikimedia’s response: Whether the Foundation/community propose a privacy‑preserving verification tier and how it affects editor workflows and newcomer retention [4].  
- EU CSAM negotiations: Whether lawmakers explicitly protect E2EE, limit detection orders to narrowly targeted cases, and reject client‑side scanning mandates [5][6].
