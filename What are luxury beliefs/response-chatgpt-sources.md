# What are luxury beliefs?

Definition  
“Luxury beliefs” is a term coined by social psychologist Rob Henderson to describe ideas, norms or ideological stances that function for affluent, well-educated people the way designer clothes or expensive cars once did: as status symbols. These beliefs are “luxury” because

1. They are relatively cheap or even cost-free for high-status individuals to profess, yet  
2. They often impose material or social risks on people lower down the economic ladder, or become costly only if one lacks money, security or social capital [1][3][5].

Why they emerged  
• Traditional luxury goods have been democratized by mass production; when “everyone can buy the handbag,” elites look for new ways to differentiate themselves. Publicly endorsing certain moral or political views is a new way to display distinction and cultural capital [1].  
• Economists model them as a form of signalling: holding or broadcasting the belief is easier (i.e., less costly) for the high-skill/high-income group, so the belief credibly signals one’s elite status in the same way schooling or conspicuous consumption once did [2].

Typical examples cited by advocates of the concept  
• “Marriage is just a piece of paper” or “open relationships are fine for raising children.” The affluent who say this usually still marry each other and give their kids two-parent homes, while marriage declines among the poor [1][3].  
• “Defund the police.” Wealthy urbanites can afford private security or live in safer neighborhoods; low-income residents bear the brunt if policing is reduced [1][5].  
• Drug decriminalization, unrestricted immigration, abolition of standardized tests, the claim that “monogamy is outdated,” etc. All can entail higher costs for those without economic cushions [1][3].

How they differ from ordinary beliefs  
• They are highly visible (often expressed on social media, in universities or cultural institutions).  
• They are relatively abstract; their material consequences are indirect and therefore less salient to the people espousing them.  
• They confer prestige precisely because they are seen as virtuous, enlightened or avant-garde within elite circles [1][2][3].

Criticism and debate  
• Some writers argue the concept is over-generalized or simply a right-wing label for progressive ideas, noting that many of the same beliefs are also common among non-elites and that elite advocacy can sometimes benefit disadvantaged groups [4][6].  
• Others find the signalling model plausible but emphasize that whether a belief is “luxury” depends on context and empirical evidence of who pays the costs [2].

In short, luxury beliefs are status-signalling ideologies predominantly held by the privileged because the costs of holding them fall largely on someone else. They represent an intangible, moralized successor to conspicuous consumption in an age when material luxuries have become widely accessible.
