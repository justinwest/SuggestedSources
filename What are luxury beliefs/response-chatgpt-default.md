**Definition and Origin:** The term **“luxury beliefs”** was coined by Rob Henderson around 2019 to describe a new form of status symbol among affluent elites ([quillette.com](https://quillette.com/2019/11/16/thorstein-veblens-theory-of-the-leisure-class-a-status-update/#:~:text=I%20was%20bewildered%20when%20I,toll%20on%20the%20lower%20class)) ([www.robkhenderson.com](https://www.robkhenderson.com/p/luxury-beliefs-are-like-possessions#:~:text=Luxury%20beliefs%20are%20ideas%20and,costs%20on%20the%20lower%20classes)). Henderson defines luxury beliefs as *“ideas and opinions that confer status on the upper class at very little cost, while often inflicting costs on the lower classes”* ([www.robkhenderson.com](https://www.robkhenderson.com/p/luxury-beliefs-are-like-possessions#:~:text=Luxury%20beliefs%20are%20ideas%20and,costs%20on%20the%20lower%20classes)). In other words, these are fashionable ideological stances that signal one’s social position, but whose social or policy consequences tend to negatively impact less privileged people. The concept builds on Thorstein Veblen’s theory of the leisure class: in the past, elites displayed status through expensive material goods, but as luxury goods became more accessible, wealthy people began using beliefs and values as the new status symbols ([www.newoxfordreview.org](https://www.newoxfordreview.org/documents/the-luxury-beliefs-of-the-ruling-class/#:~:text=calls%20%E2%80%9Cluxury%20beliefs%E2%80%9D%20among%20the,pursuits%20of%20no%20practical%20utility)) ([quillette.com](https://quillette.com/2019/11/16/thorstein-veblens-theory-of-the-leisure-class-a-status-update/#:~:text=In%20the%20past%2C%20people%20displayed,attached%20it%20to%20beliefs)). By espousing certain avant-garde or radical views, elites can **virtue-signal** their sophistication or moral enlightenment, all without jeopardizing their own comfortable lives ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/02/20/troubled-rob-henderson-luxury-beliefs-review/#:~:text=I%20also%20lacked%20words%20to,designed%20to%20keep%20them%20out)). Crucially, a core feature of a “luxury belief” is that the believer is **insulated from the consequences** of implementing that belief in society ([www.persuasion.community](https://www.persuasion.community/p/luxury-beliefs-are-real#:~:text=beliefs,podcast%20a%20few%20months%20ago)). Henderson argues that once an ideal becomes widely adopted (and thus no longer confers exclusive status), elites will abandon it for a new, more exclusive belief ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/luxury-beliefs-are-not-like-luxury#:~:text=from%20certain%20types%20of%20consumption,the%20availability%20of%20luxury%20goods)). 

**Examples of Luxury Beliefs:** Henderson and others have highlighted numerous examples that illustrate the concept: 

- **“Defund the police”** – Affluent people in **safe neighborhoods** or gated communities can afford to support anti-policing movements, knowing their personal security is unlikely to suffer; but if police budgets are cut, **crime and insecurity may rise in poorer areas** that rely on public policing ([fordhaminstitute.org](https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/educations-enduring-love-affair-luxury-beliefs#:~:text=The%20proof%20of%20a%20powerful,in%20a%20safe%20neighborhood%20that%E2%80%99s)). This makes “defund the police” a luxury belief that costs its proponents little, while lower-income communities bear the brunt of any increase in violence or disorder ([fordhaminstitute.org](https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/educations-enduring-love-affair-luxury-beliefs#:~:text=The%20proof%20of%20a%20powerful,in%20a%20safe%20neighborhood%20that%E2%80%99s)).  
- **Family and sexual norms:** Elite college students from stable, two-parent families might claim that **monogamy or marriage is outdated**, gaining social points for being progressive – yet those same students privately intend to marry and raise children in stable families themselves ([www.persuasion.community](https://www.persuasion.community/p/luxury-beliefs-are-real#:~:text=In%20his%20excellent%20memoir%2C%20Troubled%2C,to%20enter%20a%20monogamous%20marriage)). Henderson was struck by a Yale classmate who insisted it was “hopelessly outmoded” to prefer monogamy when raising kids, even as she admitted she planned to have a monogamous marriage in her own life ([www.persuasion.community](https://www.persuasion.community/p/luxury-beliefs-are-real#:~:text=In%20his%20excellent%20memoir%2C%20Troubled%2C,to%20enter%20a%20monogamous%20marriage)). He saw this as a disconnect between ideals fashionable among elites and the realities that benefit children (stable families) – a gap only someone **shielded from the risks** of family instability could ignore.  
- **Economic and cultural views:** Similarly, students at elite universities who **denounce capitalism** or brand companies like Goldman Sachs as “evil” often go on to lucrative careers in finance ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/02/20/troubled-rob-henderson-luxury-beliefs-review/#:~:text=that%20confer%20status%20on%20the,designed%20to%20keep%20them%20out)). In Henderson’s view, such rhetoric is a strategic status signal: by decrying Wall Street’s moral failings, privileged students flaunt their enlightenment while possibly discouraging some competition for corporate jobs ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/02/20/troubled-rob-henderson-luxury-beliefs-review/#:~:text=that%20confer%20status%20on%20the,designed%20to%20keep%20them%20out)). Another example is affluent **tech CEOs limiting their own children’s screen time** or schooling options while promoting technology or progressive education policies for everyone else – a *“do as I say, not as I do”* stance that less wealthy families cannot as easily offset. 

These examples share a pattern: the **proponents are socially or economically buffered** from the downsides of the policies or lifestyles they champion. A wealthy individual can advocate leniency on drug use knowing *their* family will have access to top rehab lawyers and healthcare, or promote “healthy at any size” body positivity while enjoying social acceptance as a slim person ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/02/20/troubled-rob-henderson-luxury-beliefs-review/#:~:text=I%20also%20lacked%20words%20to,designed%20to%20keep%20them%20out)). In each case, the belief elevates the speaker’s status among peers – showing them to be open-minded, altruistic, or cutting-edge – but if the belief were broadly adopted or enforced, it could **harm or destabilize less privileged groups** (increased crime, family instability, limited opportunities, etc.) ([fordhaminstitute.org](https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/educations-enduring-love-affair-luxury-beliefs#:~:text=The%20proof%20of%20a%20powerful,in%20a%20safe%20neighborhood%20that%E2%80%99s)) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/02/20/troubled-rob-henderson-luxury-beliefs-review/#:~:text=that%20confer%20status%20on%20the,designed%20to%20keep%20them%20out)). Henderson provocatively analogizes socially progressive rhetoric to a **luxury handbag** like a Birkin: it’s ostentatious and exclusive, *“not meant to lift the vulnerable up,”* but rather to **set elites apart** from those who can’t afford such ideals ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/02/20/troubled-rob-henderson-luxury-beliefs-review/#:~:text=that%20confer%20status%20on%20the,designed%20to%20keep%20them%20out)). In essence, luxury beliefs function as *cultural capital* – fine-grained markers of education and status (using the latest correct jargon, embracing avant-garde norms) that distinguish the elite class from mainstream society ([www.newoxfordreview.org](https://www.newoxfordreview.org/documents/the-luxury-beliefs-of-the-ruling-class/#:~:text=Nowadays%2C%20%E2%80%9Cluxury%20beliefs%2C%E2%80%9D%20which%20Henderson,critique%20of%20the%20American%20upper)) ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/luxury-beliefs-are-not-like-luxury#:~:text=They%20are%20luxury%20beliefs,is%20wrong%20and%20distorts%20our)). Adopting these views signals that one has the *wealth, education, or safety net* to “experiment” with social norms, much like owning a Ferrari signals one’s financial means ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/luxury-beliefs-are-not-like-luxury#:~:text=Building%20from%20other%20less%20persuasive,I%20initially%20found%20the%20luxury)) ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/luxury-beliefs-are-not-like-luxury#:~:text=They%20are%20luxury%20beliefs,similar%20though%20less%20compelling%20signaling)). 

**Debate and Criticisms:** The luxury beliefs concept has sparked debate. Supporters find the idea compelling, noting that once you learn the term you “start to see it everywhere” in elite discourse ([fordhaminstitute.org](https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/educations-enduring-love-affair-luxury-beliefs#:~:text=The%20proof%20of%20a%20powerful,in%20a%20safe%20neighborhood%20that%E2%80%99s)). They argue it explains why certain impractical or extreme positions gain traction primarily among wealthy, highly-educated circles but **remain unpopular or damaging** to the broader public ([www.persuasion.community](https://www.persuasion.community/p/luxury-beliefs-are-real#:~:text=Once%20upon%20a%20time%2C%20Henderson,population%E2%80%94have%20substituted%20for%20luxury%20goods)) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/02/20/troubled-rob-henderson-luxury-beliefs-review/#:~:text=that%20confer%20status%20on%20the,designed%20to%20keep%20them%20out)). However, critics question whether “luxury beliefs” are truly a distinct phenomenon or just a partisan label. One critique is that **holding a belief costs nothing in itself** – unlike buying a sports car or Rolex, *anyone* can profess a radical view on social media or at a dinner party with minimal personal sacrifice ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/luxury-beliefs-are-not-like-luxury#:~:text=However%2C%20there%20is%20an%20important%2C,Many%20do%20not)). As writer Bo Winegard observes, merely tweeting support for police abolition or open borders **“doesn’t cost a cent,”** so the analogy to expensive status goods breaks down ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/luxury-beliefs-are-not-like-luxury#:~:text=However%2C%20there%20is%20an%20important%2C,Many%20do%20not)). If espousing these views is essentially *free*, what makes them reliable signals of status? In traditional status-signaling theory, a signal must be **costly to fake**; critics note that many so-called luxury beliefs are easy to adopt superficially, and indeed are often promoted widely (if a stance becomes a mass trend, it no longer serves as an exclusive marker) ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/luxury-beliefs-are-not-like-luxury#:~:text=Henderson%20is%20aware%20of%20this%2C,those%20beliefs%20have%20become%20commonplaces)) ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/luxury-beliefs-are-not-like-luxury#:~:text=Luxury%20goods%20are%20impressive%20to,%E2%80%9Cdate%20test%E2%80%9D%20to%20examine%20this)). 

Another point of contention is **intent and sincerity**. Henderson’s thesis implies an element of hypocrisy or *“duplicitous”* motive – that affluent proponents of luxury beliefs are at some level aware that these ideas would be damaging if enacted, yet promote them to showcase their own virtue or to maintain status advantages ([www.persuasion.community](https://www.persuasion.community/p/luxury-beliefs-are-real#:~:text=beliefs,podcast%20a%20few%20months%20ago)) ([culture.ghost.io](https://culture.ghost.io/are-luxury-beliefs-a-real-thing-and-are-they-eroding-society/#:~:text=The%20last%20three%20of%20Henderson%27s,get%20ahead%20and%20become%20even)). Some commentators find this overly cynical. For instance, a Washington Post review argues Henderson’s view verges on *conspiratorial*: it would require believing that “privileged undergraduates want the less fortunate to be opioid-addicted, obese single parents so that they can get ahead and become even wealthier by comparison” ([culture.ghost.io](https://culture.ghost.io/are-luxury-beliefs-a-real-thing-and-are-they-eroding-society/#:~:text=individuals%20on%20college%20campuses%20must,%E2%80%9D)). In reality, many elites who hold “luxury” positions likely *genuinely believe* in them or simply conform to their social milieu, rather than consciously plotting to harm others ([culture.ghost.io](https://culture.ghost.io/are-luxury-beliefs-a-real-thing-and-are-they-eroding-society/#:~:text=The%20last%20three%20of%20Henderson%27s,get%20ahead%20and%20become%20even)). Critics also point out that problems like inequality and family breakdown have complex, systemic causes – **pinning society’s ills on elite belief-fads alone is unconvincing** ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/02/20/troubled-rob-henderson-luxury-beliefs-review/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CTroubled%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20mystifying%20book,on%20the%20talk%20show%20circuit)). In short, detractors caution that “luxury beliefs” can become a glib *epithet*, used to dismiss any opposing view as elitist hypocrisy, instead of grappling with its merits or evidence ([www.persuasion.community](https://www.persuasion.community/p/luxury-beliefs-are-real#:~:text=match%20at%20L194%20making%20elite,of%20the%20concept%E2%80%99s%20core%20definition)) ([www.persuasion.community](https://www.persuasion.community/p/luxury-beliefs-are-real#:~:text=of%20critics%20from%20Noah%20Smith,least%20in%20part%20because%20something)). 

**Alternative Perspectives:** Despite criticisms, many find the luxury beliefs concept useful in highlighting the class disconnect in certain ideological battles. Some analysts have proposed refining the definition rather than rejecting it. Political scientist Yascha Mounk, for example, argues that luxury beliefs are *real*, but suggests defining them more broadly **as beliefs people would be far less likely to hold if they weren’t insulated from the negative consequences** ([www.persuasion.community](https://www.persuasion.community/p/luxury-beliefs-are-real#:~:text=,to%20consider%2C%20their%20negative%20effects)). In his view, the essence isn’t necessarily conscious status-seeking by elites, but rather the blind spots of the privileged. Mounk notes that this phenomenon can cut across the political spectrum and geography, not just “woke” campus politics ([www.persuasion.community](https://www.persuasion.community/p/luxury-beliefs-are-real#:~:text=,inducing%20vitamin%20deficiencies)). For instance, **affluent conservatives** who oppose government healthcare programs may do so in part because **they’ve never struggled to afford medical care**, whereas a person without such insulation might feel differently ([www.persuasion.community](https://www.persuasion.community/p/luxury-beliefs-are-real#:~:text=,inducing%20vitamin%20deficiencies)). Likewise, **Western environmental activists** who campaign to block genetically modified crops in Africa often have never experienced life-threatening malnutrition themselves ([www.persuasion.community](https://www.persuasion.community/p/luxury-beliefs-are-real#:~:text=,inducing%20vitamin%20deficiencies)). In these cases, the individuals’ comfortable circumstances shield them from the downsides of their stance – making the belief a kind of luxury. This refined interpretation removes the assumption that only left-wing or “elite” ideas count as luxury beliefs; it focuses on the **condition of insulation and naïveté** about real-world effects ([www.persuasion.community](https://www.persuasion.community/p/luxury-beliefs-are-real#:~:text=,to%20consider%2C%20their%20negative%20effects)) ([www.persuasion.community](https://www.persuasion.community/p/luxury-beliefs-are-real#:~:text=On%20Henderson%E2%80%99s%20definition%2C%20the%20social,%E2%80%9D)). 

Mounk and others also emphasize that not everyone professing a luxury belief is doing so to gain status – some may be **well-intentioned but misinformed or naive**, simply echoing the consensus of their peers ([www.persuasion.community](https://www.persuasion.community/p/luxury-beliefs-are-real#:~:text=On%20Henderson%E2%80%99s%20definition%2C%20the%20social,%E2%80%9D)). The luxury belief concept is most illuminating when it highlights how **privilege (economic, social, or geographic)** allows certain ideals to flourish in one class while proving harmful or unviable for others. Used carefully, it draws attention to the gap between *symbolic virtue and lived reality*. In summary, “luxury beliefs” are those high-status ideas that **feel morally right or trendy to the educated elite, but only because the believers themselves won’t pay the price if the ideas go wrong** ([www.persuasion.community](https://www.persuasion.community/p/luxury-beliefs-are-real#:~:text=beliefs,podcast%20a%20few%20months%20ago)) ([www.persuasion.community](https://www.persuasion.community/p/luxury-beliefs-are-real#:~:text=,to%20consider%2C%20their%20negative%20effects)). It remains a provocative notion in public debate – one that supporters say explains elite hypocrisy, and critics say oversimplifies complex social issues – but it has undeniably shifted focus onto the **consequences of elite opinion** in shaping society.

1. **Rob Henderson (2019/2022) – Originator’s definition and thesis:** Henderson, who coined “luxury beliefs,” defines them as *“ideas and opinions that confer status on the upper class at little cost, while often inflicting costs on the lower classes.”* He argues that as traditional status goods became common, affluent elites began using progressive or radical beliefs as the new status symbols ([www.robkhenderson.com](https://www.robkhenderson.com/p/luxury-beliefs-are-like-possessions#:~:text=Luxury%20beliefs%20are%20ideas%20and,costs%20on%20the%20lower%20classes)) ([quillette.com](https://quillette.com/2019/11/16/thorstein-veblens-theory-of-the-leisure-class-a-status-update/#:~:text=In%20the%20past%2C%20people%20displayed,attached%20it%20to%20beliefs)). These beliefs serve as **honest indicators of social position** (e.g. using academic jargon or avant-garde views signals one’s elite education and wealth) and often **don’t personally harm their proponents** (who are shielded by privilege) even if they harm society ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/luxury-beliefs-are-not-like-luxury#:~:text=Building%20from%20other%20less%20persuasive,I%20initially%20found%20the%20luxury)) ([www.persuasion.community](https://www.persuasion.community/p/luxury-beliefs-are-real#:~:text=Once%20upon%20a%20time%2C%20Henderson,population%E2%80%94have%20substituted%20for%20luxury%20goods)). Henderson’s viewpoint is that the **“luxury belief class”** now marks itself by virtuous-sounding ideas (from defunding police to denouncing monogamy) which ultimately **erode social norms and burden the less fortunate** ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/02/20/troubled-rob-henderson-luxury-beliefs-review/#:~:text=I%20also%20lacked%20words%20to,designed%20to%20keep%20them%20out)) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/02/20/troubled-rob-henderson-luxury-beliefs-review/#:~:text=right,American%20family%20and%2C%20thus%2C%20society)).

2. **Robert Pondiscio/Bari Weiss (2021) – Supportive commentary on prevalence:** Education writer Robert Pondiscio, echoing journalist Bari Weiss, praises “luxury beliefs” as a powerful explanatory idea that, *“once you hear about it, you start to see it everywhere.”* He notes the concept was **“coined by Rob Henderson”**, and gives the example that you can afford to support *“defunding the police”* if you live in a **safe, affluent area**, whereas that same idea would put poorer communities at risk ([fordhaminstitute.org](https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/educations-enduring-love-affair-luxury-beliefs#:~:text=The%20proof%20of%20a%20powerful,in%20a%20safe%20neighborhood%20that%E2%80%99s)). This view highlights that luxury beliefs are **largely held by privileged progressives** who won’t bear the immediate costs (e.g. rising crime), revealing a class gap in what ideas are considered acceptable or high-status ([fordhaminstitute.org](https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/educations-enduring-love-affair-luxury-beliefs#:~:text=The%20proof%20of%20a%20powerful,in%20a%20safe%20neighborhood%20that%E2%80%99s)). Weiss and Pondiscio thus see luxury beliefs as a real phenomenon explaining elite policy fads in areas like education and law enforcement.

3. **Bo Winegard, *Aporia* Magazine (2023) – Critical examination:** Winegard critically analyzes the “luxury beliefs” hypothesis, arguing it is *“wrong and distorts our understanding”* of why people hold extreme views ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/luxury-beliefs-are-not-like-luxury#:~:text=account%20of%20some%20of%20these,our%20understanding%20of%20such%20beliefs)). He points out that **unlike luxury goods, beliefs often have no immediate personal cost**, making them unreliable as status signals ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/luxury-beliefs-are-not-like-luxury#:~:text=However%2C%20there%20is%20an%20important%2C,Many%20do%20not)). For example, *“asserting support for abolishing the police costs nothing”* – anyone can say it, so it’s not a hard-to-fake display of wealth or education ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/luxury-beliefs-are-not-like-luxury#:~:text=However%2C%20there%20is%20an%20important%2C,Many%20do%20not)). Winegard suggests many so-called luxury beliefs function more as **tribal identifiers or group loyalties** rather than deliberate status symbols ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/luxury-beliefs-are-not-like-luxury#:~:text=Although%20luxury%20beliefs%20are%20probably,believe%20that%20Jesus%20Christ%20died)) ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/luxury-beliefs-are-not-like-luxury#:~:text=Identifiers%20share%20many%20qualities%20with,might%20explain%20why%20those%20who)). He also notes that proponents often *want* their ideas widely adopted (e.g. activists zealously promote open borders or polyamory), which contradicts the notion of keeping a signal exclusive
