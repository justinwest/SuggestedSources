Economists have long made predictions about the economic impacts of immigration, focusing on areas such as wages, employment, fiscal contributions, and overall economic growth. These predictions often stem from theoretical models, empirical studies, and policy analyses. However, their accuracy has varied significantly depending on the context (e.g., country, type of immigration, and time period), the assumptions underlying the models, and unforeseen factors like policy changes or global events. In this response, I evaluate the accuracy of these predictions by examining key claims, empirical evidence from provided and additional sources, and areas of consensus or debate. Overall, while some predictions—such as limited short-term wage depression for natives—have held up reasonably well, others, particularly on long-term fiscal impacts and labor market integration, have proven overly optimistic or inaccurate, leading to criticism of economists' forecasting reliability.

### Key Predictions and Their Accuracy

#### 1. Wage and Employment Effects on Natives
A common prediction among economists is that immigration has a small or negligible negative effect on native wages and employment, especially in the short term, due to factors like labor market complementarity (immigrants filling roles natives avoid) and economic growth spurred by increased labor supply [4]. For instance, David Card's influential 1990 study on the Mariel Boatlift—a sudden influx of Cuban immigrants to Miami in 1980—predicted and found no significant wage decline for low-skilled natives, attributing this to rapid absorption into the economy [4].

- **Accuracy Assessment**: This prediction has been moderately accurate in specific cases but contested in others. Follow-up analyses, including by George Borjas, re-examined the Mariel data and found evidence of wage suppression for high school dropouts (a 10-30% drop in relative wages), suggesting Card's optimistic view underestimated impacts on vulnerable groups [1][5]. Broader meta-analyses, such as a 2016 National Academies of Sciences report, confirm that immigration's wage effects are small overall (e.g., a 1-2% reduction for low-skilled natives over a decade) but can be more pronounced in localized or high-immigration scenarios [5]. In the UK context, pre-Brexit predictions by economists like those from the London School of Economics often downplayed wage harms, but post-2016 data showed mixed results, with some sectors experiencing downward pressure [2]. Overall, predictions have been accurate for aggregate effects but less so for distributional impacts on low-wage workers.

#### 2. Fiscal Impacts and Public Finances
Economists frequently predict that immigrants, particularly skilled ones, contribute positively to public finances through taxes and lower welfare usage, offsetting costs like education and healthcare for their children [3][5]. For example, models from the OECD and others have projected net fiscal benefits from immigration in high-income countries, assuming immigrants integrate quickly and boost productivity [6].

- **Accuracy Assessment**: These predictions have often been inaccurate or overly optimistic, especially for non-selective immigration from lower-income countries. Emil Kirkegaard's analysis of Danish data shows stark variations by origin: immigrants from Western countries contribute positively (e.g., +€50,000 lifetime net fiscal impact), while those from the Middle East and Africa impose net costs (e.g., -€200,000 or more), due to lower employment rates and higher welfare dependency [3]. This aligns with Borjas's work, which critiques optimistic fiscal models for ignoring long-term costs like family reunification and skill mismatches, leading to underestimations of net drains on public budgets [1]. In the UK, economists' pre-2010 predictions of fiscal neutrality or benefits from EU migration were contradicted by later studies showing a net fiscal cost of £6.4 billion annually for non-EEA immigrants (due to lower earnings and higher public service use) [2]. A 2022 OECD report acknowledges that while skilled immigration often yields fiscal surpluses, low-skilled or humanitarian flows frequently do not, highlighting how predictions failed to account for integration challenges [6]. Accuracy improves when models incorporate origin-specific data, but broad generalizations have proven unreliable.

#### 3. Overall Economic Growth and Productivity
Many economists predict that immigration boosts GDP growth by expanding the labor force, fostering innovation, and filling skill gaps. For instance, projections from the U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimate that increased immigration could add $7 trillion to U.S. GDP over a decade through higher productivity [7].

- **Accuracy Assessment**: These predictions have generally been accurate at the macro level but with caveats. Empirical evidence from the U.S. and Europe supports modest GDP gains (e.g., 0.5-1% annual growth boost from immigration), as seen in studies of historical waves like post-WWII European migration [5]. However, critics argue that per capita growth—the more relevant metric for natives—often stagnates or declines due to population dilution effects [1][2]. In the UK, economists' forecasts of immigration-driven growth post-EU enlargement (2004) were partially validated by a 2-3% GDP increase, but this masked productivity stagnation and regional inequalities [2]. Kirkegaard's data further shows that while some immigrant groups enhance productivity, others do not, leading to overestimations in non-selective systems [3]. Predictions have been less accurate in predicting backlash effects, such as political responses (e.g., Brexit), which economists largely failed to anticipate [2].

### Factors Contributing to Inaccuracies
Several issues undermine the accuracy of economists' predictions:
- **Model Assumptions**: Many rely on "perfect integration" assumptions that overlook cultural, educational, and discrimination barriers [1][3].
- **Data Limitations**: Early predictions often used aggregate data, missing subgroup variations (e.g., by skill level or origin) [3][5].
- **External Shocks**: Events like recessions or policy shifts (e.g., welfare reforms) can alter outcomes, as seen in the 2008 financial crisis amplifying fiscal costs [2].
- **Consensus Bias**: A perceived "pro-immigration" bias in academia may lead to downplaying negatives, as critiqued in sources highlighting "failure" in forecasting [2].

In summary, economists' predictions about immigration have been accurate in highlighting broad benefits like GDP growth and minimal average wage effects but have often erred on fiscal impacts and distributional consequences, particularly for low-skilled immigration. Greater accuracy emerges from nuanced, data-driven approaches that account for heterogeneity. For policymakers, this underscores the need for selective immigration policies to align outcomes with predictions.
