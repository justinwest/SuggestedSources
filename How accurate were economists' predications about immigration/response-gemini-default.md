Economists' predictions about immigration have varied in accuracy depending on the specific economic area in question. Rather than making singular forecasts, economists build models based on theory to predict likely outcomes. The accuracy of these predictions has evolved as models have grown more sophisticated to better reflect the complexities of the real world. Overall, the consensus view is that immigration is a net economic positive, but the predictions regarding its specific effects, particularly on labor markets, have been a subject of intense study and revision.

### 1. Labor Market Impacts: Wages and Employment

This is the most debated area and where initial, simple predictions were often inaccurate.

*   **The Simple Prediction:** Based on a basic supply-and-demand model, a large influx of immigrants, particularly those with lower skills, would increase the supply of labor and therefore push down wages for native-born workers in similar jobs. This was the canonical prediction for decades.

*   **The Empirical Reality and Evolving Accuracy:** Empirical studies have shown that the negative wage effect predicted by the simple model is either very small, non-existent, or highly concentrated on specific groups (like previous immigrants or native-born workers without a high school diploma). The simple prediction was largely inaccurate because it missed several key dynamics:
    *   **Immigrants as Complements:** Immigrants are not always perfect substitutes for native workers. They often have different skills, work in different occupations, or take jobs that natives are less willing to do. This "complementarity" can make native workers more productive. For example, an influx of construction laborers can create more demand for native-born foremen, electricians, and plumbers [1].
    *   **Demand Creation:** Immigrants are not just workers; they are also consumers. They rent apartments, buy groceries, and use services, which increases overall economic demand and creates new jobs.
    *   **Capital Adjustment:** Firms respond to an increase in labor by investing in new capital (machinery, equipment, buildings), which increases productivity and helps offset downward wage pressure.
    *   **Occupational Upgrading:** In response to low-skill immigration, some native-born workers move into higher-paying jobs that require better communication and language skills, where they have a comparative advantage [1].

The landmark study of the 1980 Mariel Boatlift, when 125,000 Cubans arrived in Miami, is a classic example. Economist David Card famously found that the event had a negligible impact on the wages and unemployment rates of Miami's low-skilled workers [2]. While this finding has been challenged and re-analyzed by economists like George Borjas, who found some negative wage effects for the least-educated workers [3], the broader consensus remains that the effects predicted by simple models are far larger than what is observed in reality.

**Accuracy Verdict:** Low. The simple prediction of significant negative wage impacts for native workers has not been borne out by the majority of empirical evidence. More nuanced models that account for complementarity and demand effects are far more accurate.

### 2. Fiscal Impacts: Taxes vs. Public Services

Economists have long predicted that the fiscal impact of an immigrant depends heavily on their characteristics, such as age, education, and legal status.

*   **The Prediction:** High-skilled, working-age immigrants would be net fiscal contributors, paying more in taxes than they consume in public services. Conversely, low-skilled immigrants, refugees, and elderly immigrants would likely be net fiscal costs, at least in the short term, as they may use more in services (e.g., public education, healthcare) than they contribute in taxes.

*   **The Empirical Reality:** This is an area where economists' predictions have been broadly accurate. A comprehensive 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) confirmed this framework [4]. Key findings include:
    *   On average, first-generation immigrants are more costly to governments than the native-born population, primarily due to the costs of educating their children.
    *   However, the children of immigrants (the second generation) are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population, out-earning and contributing more in taxes than both their parents and the average native-born citizen.
    *   When viewed over the long term (75 years), the net fiscal impact of immigration is strongly positive.

**Accuracy Verdict:** High. The conditional predictions made by economists—that fiscal impacts vary by immigrant skill level and over time—have been consistently supported by comprehensive data analysis.

### 3. Economic Growth, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship

Economists have generally predicted that immigration, especially of high-skilled individuals, is a powerful engine for economic growth, innovation, and dynamism.

*   **The Prediction:** Immigrants, particularly those arriving through skilled-worker programs or to pursue higher education, would increase the rate of innovation (e.g., patenting), start new businesses at high rates, and fill critical labor shortages in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) fields, boosting overall GDP.

*   **The Empirical Reality:** The evidence strongly supports these predictions.
    *   **Innovation:** Studies show a direct link between H-1B visas for skilled workers and increased patenting in the U.S. [5]. Immigrants are disproportionately represented among Nobel laureates, members of the National Academies, and patent holders.
    *   **Entrepreneurship:** Immigrants are significantly more likely to start businesses than native-born citizens. A 2022 study found that immigrants are nearly 80% more likely to found a new firm [6]. Immigrants have founded over half of American startup companies valued at $1 billion or more.
    *   **GDP Growth:** The broad consensus among economists is that immigration increases a country's total GDP. While the effect on GDP *per capita* is more debated, most studies find a small but positive impact, driven by the innovation and productivity gains immigrants bring [7].

**Accuracy Verdict:** High. The predictions that immigration would be a major driver of entrepreneurship, innovation, and top-line economic growth have been overwhelmingly confirmed by data.

### Conclusion

Economists' ability to predict the effects of immigration has improved significantly over time.

*   **Least Accurate:** Predictions based on simple labor market models that treated immigrants as perfect substitutes for native workers proved to be largely incorrect. The real-world wage impacts on natives are much smaller and more complex than these models suggested.
*   **Most Accurate:** Predictions regarding the drivers of fiscal impact (skill, age) and the role of high-skilled immigration in fostering innovation, entrepreneurship, and overall economic growth have been very accurate and are supported by a vast body of evidence.

The modern economic consensus, built on decades of empirical research, is that immigration provides substantial net economic benefits. The primary challenge, which economists continue to study, is not whether the economy benefits, but how to best manage the distributional consequences to support the small segment of the population that may face negative pressures.

By focusing specifically on the wages of male, non-Hispanic high school dropouts, he argues that the boatlift did cause a significant and sharp decline in wages for this narrow group of workers who were in direct competition with the Marielitos. His work highlights the importance of methodology and defining the "competing" group.
