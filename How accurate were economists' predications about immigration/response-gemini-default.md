Economists' predictions about immigration have been a mixed bag, demonstrating accuracy in some broad areas while being less precise or even incorrect on more specific, distributional effects. The accuracy often depends on the simplicity of the economic model used versus the complex, dynamic reality of how an economy absorbs new people.

### 1. Areas of Relative Accuracy

Economists were largely correct in predicting the macroeconomic benefits of immigration. The foundational principles of economics suggest that increasing the supply of a key input—labor—will increase the overall output of an economy.

*   **Overall Economic Growth (GDP):** The most robust and accurate prediction is that immigration increases the total size of the economy. Immigrants are both workers and consumers; they fill jobs, pay taxes, and purchase goods and services, all of which contribute to a higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A landmark 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine confirmed that immigration is integral to the nation’s economic growth, primarily by increasing the labor force [1].
*   **Labor Supply:** Predictions that immigrants would expand the labor supply, particularly in sectors facing shortages, have been proven correct. Immigrants are disproportionately represented in both high-skill STEM fields and in essential, physically demanding jobs like agriculture, construction, and hospitality [2]. This expansion of the labor pool allows the economy to produce more than it otherwise could.
*   **Innovation and Entrepreneurship:** Economists who predicted that immigration would be a catalyst for innovation and business formation have also been vindicated. Studies consistently show that immigrants are more likely to start businesses than their native-born counterparts. This entrepreneurial activity creates jobs for everyone and contributes to economic dynamism [1, 3].

### 2. Areas of Inaccuracy and Intense Debate

The primary area where economic predictions have been less accurate, or at least highly contentious, is the impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers, especially those with lower levels of education.

*   **Wages of Native-Born Workers:** The simple "textbook" supply-and-demand model predicts that a large influx of low-skilled labor will increase competition and drive down the wages of low-skilled native-born workers. The reality has proven far more complex, and economists are fiercely divided on the magnitude of this effect.
    *   **The "No Effect" Camp:** A seminal 1990 study by David Card examined the 1980 Mariel Boatlift, when 125,000 Cuban immigrants (many of whom were low-skilled) arrived in Miami. He found no discernible negative impact on the wages or employment of low-skilled workers in Miami compared to other similar cities [4]. This and subsequent research suggest that economies are dynamic: capital flows to where labor is plentiful, immigrants create new demand, and immigrant labor can often *complement* native labor rather than substitute for it (e.g., an immigrant construction crew creates a job for a native-born site manager) [2].
    *   **The "Negative Effect" Camp:** In contrast, economist George Borjas of Harvard University has argued that looking only at a single city is misleading, as native workers may move out in response to immigration, spreading the wage impact across the country. His national-level research suggests that immigration has had a significant negative effect on the wages of one specific group: native-born high school dropouts. He estimates that immigration from 1980 to 2000 may have reduced their wages by as much as 5% [5].
    *   **The Consensus View:** Most empirical studies find that the overall effect of immigration on native-born wages is very small—either slightly positive or slightly negative—and close to zero. However, there is a consensus that for the small group of native-born workers who did not finish high school and are in direct competition with low-skilled immigrants, there is likely a modest negative wage effect in the short run [1, 6]. The initial, simple prediction of a large, widespread wage decline for low-skilled workers was therefore inaccurate because it failed to account for the economy's complex adjustment mechanisms.

*   **Fiscal Impact:** Predicting the net fiscal impact (taxes paid vs. services consumed) is also difficult and has led to varied results.
    *   Early, simplistic predictions often failed to differentiate among immigrants. The reality is that the fiscal impact depends heavily on an immigrant's age, education, and skill level. High-skilled immigrants are a major fiscal positive, paying significantly more in taxes than they consume in services over their lifetimes [1].
    *   Low-skilled immigrants can represent a net fiscal cost, particularly at the state and local levels, which bear the primary cost of educating children and providing emergency healthcare, while the federal government receives most of the income and payroll taxes [1].
    *   Crucially, predictions often miss the long-term, multi-generational view. The National Academies report found that while first-generation immigrants may be a modest fiscal burden, their children (the second generation) are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population, paying more in taxes than either their parents' generation or native-born Americans of the same generation [1].

### Conclusion

In summary, economists' predictions have been accurate on the broad, macroeconomic level: immigration grows the economy, expands the labor force, and fosters entrepreneurship. However, their initial, simpler models were less accurate at predicting the specific distributional consequences, particularly regarding wages. The effect on native-born wages is not the large, negative impact some predicted, but a small, nuanced, and hotly debated effect concentrated on a specific subgroup of the population (high school dropouts). Likewise, fiscal predictions have become more accurate as they have grown more sophisticated, accounting for skill levels and multi-generational impacts. The ongoing debate highlights that the economy is not a static system, and the effects of immigration are shaped by complex, dynamic adjustments that simple models struggle to capture.

> **Author's View:** This comprehensive report, authored by a panel of leading economists and sociologists, synthesizes existing research. It concludes that immigration has a net positive effect on long-term economic growth and the fiscal health of the U.S. It finds small, and in the long-run, potentially positive wage effects for most native-born workers, but notes that there can be short-term negative effects on the wages of prior immigrants and native-born workers with similar skills (especially high school dropouts). It emphasizes that the children of immigrants are strong economic and fiscal contributors.

> **Author's View:** Michael Clemens, an economist at the Center for Global Development, argues that the economic case for immigration is overwhelmingly positive. He stresses that immigrant labor is often a complement, not a substitute, for native labor and that the economy dynamically adjusts to absorb new workers, leading to overall gains. He critiques studies that find large negative impacts as often being methodologically flawed or failing to capture the full picture.

> **Author's View:** Sari Pekkala Kerr and William R. Kerr provide a detailed overview of research on immigrant entrepreneurship. Their work shows that immigrants have higher rates of business ownership and self-employment than native-born citizens in many countries, including the United States. This entrepreneurial activity is a significant, positive economic contribution.

> **Author's View:** David Card's influential paper analyzes a natural experiment—the sudden arrival of Cuban immigrants in Miami. He finds that this large, unexpected influx of low-skilled labor had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled non-Cuban workers in Miami, challenging the simple economic model that predicts negative wage impacts.

> **Author's View:** George Borjas is a leading proponent of the view that low-skilled immigration harms the economic prospects of low-skilled native-born workers. He argues that studies like Card's miss the national picture and that when analyzed at the national level over decades, immigration is shown to lower the wages of the least-educated Americans who are in direct competition for the same jobs.

> **Author's View:** Giovanni Peri, an economist at UC Davis, summarizes the literature and presents his own research. He concludes that on average, immigration has a small but positive effect on the wages of native-born workers. He argues that this is because immigrants complement the skills of natives, push natives into higher-skilled communication-intensive jobs, and stimulate investment, offsetting the competition effect.
