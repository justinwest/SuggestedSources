# ü§ñ Claude's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

Economists' predictions about immigration have shown mixed accuracy, with significant failures in some key areas and better performance in others.

## Labor Market Impact Predictions

One of the most significant predictive failures occurred in the UK regarding EU immigration following the 2004 enlargement. The British government's economists predicted that only 5,000-13,000 migrants would arrive annually from the new EU member states, but the actual number was approximately 170,000 in the first year alone - more than ten times the prediction [2]. This massive underestimation had real policy consequences, as the UK was one of only three countries that didn't impose transitional restrictions on workers from new EU members.

Regarding wage effects, economic models have generally predicted that immigration would have minimal impact on native wages, particularly in the long run. However, these predictions have faced challenges when confronted with real-world data. Some studies have found larger negative effects on wages for certain groups, particularly low-skilled workers, than standard economic models initially suggested [1].

## Employment Effects

Classical economic theory predicted that immigration wouldn't significantly reduce employment opportunities for native workers, based on the assumption that labor demand is elastic and the economy can absorb additional workers. While some empirical evidence supports this view in aggregate terms, the reality has proven more nuanced, with effects varying significantly by skill level, geographic area, and time period [1].

## Methodological Challenges

The mixed accuracy of economists' immigration predictions stems from several methodological limitations. Economic models often rely on simplified assumptions about labor market flexibility, perfect information, and rational behavior that don't always hold in practice [2]. Additionally, many studies have struggled to account for dynamic effects, such as how native workers might respond to immigration by changing their job search behavior or how immigrants might create new economic opportunities.

The "spatial correlation" problem has also plagued immigration research, where economists attempt to measure effects by comparing areas with different immigration levels, but fail to account for the fact that immigrants may choose destinations based on existing economic conditions [1].

## Prediction Accuracy Varies by Context

Economists have been more successful in predicting some aspects of immigration's impact than others. Long-term predictions about overall economic growth and productivity effects have generally been more accurate than short-term predictions about specific labor market disruptions. Similarly, predictions about highly skilled immigration have tended to be more reliable than those about low-skilled immigration [1].

## Lessons and Ongoing Challenges

The track record reveals that economists' immigration predictions are most vulnerable when they involve:
- Forecasting migration flows, especially in response to policy changes
- Estimating short-term labor market disruptions
- Accounting for geographic and occupational mobility responses
- Predicting political and social responses that can affect economic outcomes

While economic theory provides valuable frameworks for understanding immigration's effects, the complexity of real-world labor markets and human behavior continues to challenge the accuracy of specific predictions [2].

Economists' predictions about the economic effects of immigration have been a subject of intense debate, with analyses suggesting they were accurate in some respects but significantly flawed in others, particularly concerning wage impacts on low-skilled workers and the pace of immigrant assimilation.

### Areas of Inaccurate or Contested Predictions

A major point of contention is the predicted impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers. For decades, a broad consensus among economists held that the negative wage effects of immigration were minimal or nonexistent [2, 3]. This view was based on studies showing that local economies could absorb new arrivals without significant disruption to the local labor market [3, 4]. For instance, the UK‚Äôs Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) and the Bank of England consistently promoted the view that large-scale immigration from new EU member states after 2004 had little to no adverse effect on the wages of Britain's lowest-paid workers [2].

However, critics argue this consensus was a significant failure.
*   **Underestimation of Wage Impacts:** Economist George Borjas argues that basic supply-and-demand theory predicts an influx of low-skilled labor will lower the wages of competing low-skilled native workers. He contends that many studies missed this effect by focusing on local labor markets, where native workers might move away in response to immigration, thus spreading the wage impact across the entire country. His national-level analyses suggest that for every 10% increase in the supply of labor from a specific skill group, the wages for that group fall by 3-4% [1]. Similarly, J.R. Shackleton points to evidence that the wave of Eastern European immigration did, in fact, exert downward pressure on the wages of the UK's least-skilled workers, a reality that the economic establishment downplayed, contributing to public discontent that fueled Brexit [2].
*   **Overly Optimistic Assimilation Rates:** Economists traditionally predicted that immigrants would experience rapid economic assimilation, with their wages catching up to those of native-born workers over a generation. Borjas's research challenges this, showing that while this was true for immigrant waves in the mid-20th century, more recent cohorts since the 1980s have started with a much larger initial wage gap and are assimilating far more slowly. This slower convergence means that the economic gap between recent immigrants and natives may persist for multiple generations [1].

### Areas of More Accurate Predictions

While criticized for their wage predictions, economists were more accurate in other areas, though these predictions often came with important caveats that were not well-communicated.

*   **Overall Economic Gains (The "Immigration Surplus"):** Most economic models correctly predicted that immigration generates a net economic gain for the native-born population, known as the "immigration surplus." This surplus arises because immigration increases the supply of labor, allowing companies to expand production and lower prices. This benefits owners of capital (e.g., business owners) and consumers [1, 3]. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) affirmed in a major 2017 report that immigration has an overall positive impact on long-run economic growth in the U.S. [3].
*   **Distributional Consequences:** The central caveat to the "immigration surplus"‚Äîone that Borjas and other critics argue was often ignored‚Äîis that the gains are not distributed evenly. The surplus itself is generated precisely *because* the wages of competing native workers are suppressed. Therefore, while the native population as a whole benefits, some groups (low-skilled workers) lose, while others (capital owners and high-skilled workers who use immigrant services) win [1]. The failure was not in predicting the surplus, but in failing to adequately predict and communicate these significant distributional consequences, leading the public to believe that immigration was a win for everyone [2].
*   **Fiscal Impacts:** Economists' predictions about the fiscal impact of immigrants (taxes paid vs. services consumed) have been nuanced and generally borne out by evidence. Studies show that outcomes vary significantly by skill level. High-skilled immigrants tend to be strong net fiscal contributors, paying more in taxes than they consume in public benefits over their lifetimes. Conversely, low-skilled immigrants are often net fiscal drains, particularly at state and local levels where education and healthcare costs are concentrated [1, 3].

In summary, economists accurately predicted that immigration would produce a net economic benefit for the destination country. However, their predictions are widely criticized for underestimating the negative impact on low-skilled native workers' wages, being overly optimistic about the pace of assimilation for recent immigrant cohorts, and failing to effectively communicate that the overall gains came with significant distributional losses for specific segments of the population [1, 2, 3].

# ü§ñ Grok's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

Economists have long debated and predicted the effects of immigration on host countries' economies, focusing on areas such as wages, employment, fiscal impacts, and overall growth. Predictions vary widely, with some economists forecasting net benefits (e.g., increased innovation, labor supply, and economic dynamism) and others warning of drawbacks (e.g., wage suppression for low-skilled natives and fiscal burdens). Assessing the accuracy of these predictions requires comparing them against empirical evidence from studies, historical data, and real-world outcomes. Overall, economists' predictions have been mixed in accuracy: many optimistic forecasts have held up in aggregate terms, but specific predictions about distributional effects (e.g., on low-wage workers) have often been overstated or understated, influenced by methodological differences and unforeseen factors like policy changes or economic shocks [1][3]. This response draws on the suggested sources and additional reputable studies to provide a balanced evaluation.

### Key Predictions by Economists
Economists' predictions about immigration typically fall into two broad camps:

1. **Optimistic Views**: Many economists, particularly those using general equilibrium models or focusing on long-term effects, predict that immigration boosts economic growth without significantly harming native workers. For instance, they argue that immigrants fill labor shortages, increase consumer demand, and contribute to innovation. A common prediction is that immigration has minimal or no negative impact on native wages and employment, as immigrants often complement rather than substitute for native labor [3][4]. In the U.S. context, economists like David Card predicted (based on events like the 1980 Mariel Boatlift) that sudden influxes of low-skilled immigrants would not depress wages for similar native workers, due to market adjustments [4].

2. **Pessimistic Views**: Other economists predict adverse effects, especially for low-skilled natives. They forecast wage declines, higher unemployment, and fiscal costs from immigrants' use of public services outweighing their tax contributions. George Borjas, for example, has predicted that immigration reduces wages for native high-school dropouts by 3-5% in the short term, based on supply-and-demand models [1]. In the UK, similar predictions suggested that post-2004 EU enlargement immigration would strain public finances and lower wages for low-skilled workers [2].

These predictions often rely on econometric models, historical analogies, or simulations, but they can diverge due to assumptions about immigrant skill levels, assimilation rates, and economic conditions.

### Accuracy of Predictions: Evidence and Evaluations
Empirical evidence shows that economists' predictions have been partially accurate but often inaccurate in magnitude or specificity, with outcomes varying by context (e.g., country, time period, and immigrant characteristics).

- **Wage and Employment Effects**: Optimistic predictions have fared better in many cases. David Card's analysis of the Mariel Boatlift found no wage decline for low-skilled Miami workers, contradicting substitution-based predictions [4]. Broader meta-analyses, such as a 2017 National Academies of Sciences report, conclude that immigration has small negative effects on low-skilled natives' wages (around 0-2% over a decade) but positive long-term effects on the economy [3]. However, pessimistic predictions like Borjas's have been supported in some studies; his work estimates a 3-5% wage hit for U.S. low-skilled natives from 1980-2000 immigration, though this has been critiqued for methodological flaws, such as not accounting for regional mobility [1][3]. In the UK, economists predicted minimal wage impacts from EU immigration, but post-2010 data showed slight wage suppression (1-2%) for low earners, indicating underestimation [2][5].

- **Fiscal and Broader Economic Impacts**: Predictions of fiscal burdens have often been overstated. Economists like Borjas forecasted net costs from low-skilled immigration due to welfare usage [1], but the National Academies report found that first-generation immigrants may cost states $1,600 per person annually in the short term, while their descendants contribute a net positive $80,000 over their lifetimes [3]. In Europe, predictions of economic strain from post-2004 migration were inaccurate; a 2016 study found EU immigrants contributed ¬£20 billion net to the UK treasury from 2001-2011, exceeding predictions of fiscal drag [5]. However, some predictions failed to anticipate indirect effects, like housing price inflation or public service strains, which materialized in high-immigration areas [2].

- **Notable Failures and Successes**: The provided sources highlight inaccuracies. Borjas argues that economists underestimated immigration's downsides, such as cultural and economic assimilation challenges, leading to overly rosy predictions [1]. The "Not On Your Team" blog critiques UK economists for failing to predict the wage and productivity stagnation following high immigration levels in the 2000s, attributing this to overreliance on aggregate models that ignored local labor market dynamics [2]. On the success side, predictions of innovation boosts have been accurate; immigrants are 3-4 times more likely to start businesses, aligning with forecasts and contributing to GDP growth [3][6].

Factors contributing to inaccuracies include data limitations (e.g., undocumented immigration), endogeneity (e.g., immigrants self-select into booming economies), and external shocks (e.g., the 2008 financial crisis amplified some negative effects) [2][3]. Recent machine learning-based studies suggest earlier models overstated negative wage effects by not fully capturing complementarity [6].

### Conclusion
Economists' predictions about immigration have been moderately accurate at the aggregate level‚Äîoften correctly forecasting net economic benefits‚Äîbut less so for distributional impacts, where harms to low-skilled natives were sometimes underestimated or exaggerated. Optimistic predictions have generally aligned better with long-term evidence, while pessimistic ones highlight valid risks in specific contexts. Accuracy improves with better data and models, but immigration's effects remain context-dependent. Policymakers should weigh these predictions cautiously, incorporating multidisciplinary insights beyond economics [1][3].

# ü§ñ Claude's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

Economists' predictions about immigration have shown a mixed track record, with some areas of greater accuracy than others. The field has evolved significantly over decades, with early predictions often proving overly pessimistic compared to more nuanced modern assessments.

## Labor Market Effects

Early economic predictions about immigration's impact on native workers were often more negative than reality proved. The influential 1994 study by George Borjas suggested that immigration significantly reduced wages for native workers, particularly those without high school education [1]. However, subsequent research has found these effects to be much smaller than initially predicted. A comprehensive analysis by the National Academy of Sciences in 2016 found that immigration has had minimal impact on native wages overall, with any negative effects concentrated among workers without high school diplomas and being relatively small in magnitude [2].

Economists initially underestimated the economy's ability to absorb immigrant workers through job creation and complementarity effects. Modern research shows that immigrants often take jobs that complement rather than directly compete with native workers, and that their presence can actually increase demand for native workers in certain sectors [3].

## Fiscal Impact Predictions

Economic predictions about immigration's fiscal effects have been particularly challenging and often inaccurate. Early studies frequently overestimated the fiscal burden of immigration by focusing primarily on first-generation costs while underestimating long-term contributions. The 2016 National Academy of Sciences report found that while first-generation immigrants may impose net fiscal costs at the state and local level, second and third generations typically contribute more in taxes than they consume in government benefits over their lifetimes [2].

Economists also initially underestimated immigrants' entrepreneurial contributions. Research has shown that immigrants are significantly more likely to start businesses than native-born Americans, with immigrant-founded companies creating substantial employment for native workers [4].

## Economic Growth Predictions

Many economists were overly conservative in predicting immigration's impact on overall economic growth. Historical analysis shows that periods of high immigration, such as the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coincided with rapid economic expansion rather than the economic disruption some predicted [5]. Modern research indicates that immigration contributes positively to GDP growth, innovation, and productivity improvements.

The prediction accuracy regarding high-skilled immigration has been generally better, with economists correctly anticipating positive effects on innovation, patent creation, and economic dynamism in technology sectors [6].

## Methodological Evolution

The accuracy of economic predictions about immigration has improved over time as methodologies have become more sophisticated. Early studies often used simple correlation analysis or cross-sectional data, while modern research employs natural experiments, instrumental variables, and longitudinal data to better isolate causal effects [7]. This methodological advancement has led to more accurate predictions and a better understanding of immigration's complex economic effects.

## Regional and Temporal Variations

Economists have struggled to accurately predict how immigration effects vary across different regions and time periods. Local labor market conditions, industry composition, and institutional factors all influence outcomes in ways that were often underestimated in early predictions [8]. More recent work has better accounted for these variations, leading to more accurate localized predictions.

## Overall Assessment

While economists' early predictions about immigration were often overly pessimistic, the field has made significant progress in understanding and predicting immigration's economic effects. Modern economic research generally finds that immigration's overall economic impact is positive, though with some distributional effects that vary by skill level and time frame. The accuracy of predictions has improved substantially as data quality and methodological sophistication have advanced.

Economists' predictions about immigration are not a single forecast but a complex body of research that has evolved over time. The accuracy of these predictions often depends on the specific economic variable being examined (e.g., wages, employment, GDP, fiscal impact), the timeframe (short-run vs. long-run), and the characteristics of the immigrants themselves (e.g., skill level).

Overall, the consensus among most economists is that immigration has a net positive effect on the economy. However, the predictions and findings regarding its distributional effects‚Äîwho wins and who loses‚Äîare more debated.

Here is a breakdown of economists' predictions in key areas and their general accuracy.

### 1. Impact on Wages and Employment

This is one of the most studied and debated aspects of immigration economics.

*   **The Simplistic Prediction:** A basic supply-and-demand model would predict that an influx of new workers (increased labor supply) would lower wages for native-born workers competing for the same jobs.
*   **The More Nuanced Prediction & Reality:** Most modern economic models predict that the negative wage impact is, on average, very small or nonexistent for the native-born population as a whole. The predictions have proven largely accurate for several reasons:
    *   **Labor Market Complementarity:** Immigrants often do not directly compete with native-born workers. They frequently fill jobs that natives are less willing to take (e.g., in agriculture or certain service sectors) or have skills that complement the native workforce. For instance, an influx of construction laborers can create more demand for higher-skilled construction managers, architects, and engineers, who are predominantly native-born [1].
    *   **Increased Demand:** Immigrants are also consumers. They rent apartments, buy groceries, and use services, which increases overall economic demand and creates new jobs.
    *   **Capital Adjustment:** In the long run, the economy adjusts to a larger labor force. Companies invest in more machinery, equipment, and infrastructure to accommodate more workers, which helps to restore the capital-to-labor ratio and, consequently, wages [2].
*   **Accuracy and Remaining Debate:** The prediction of a small overall effect has been well-supported by evidence. However, there is a significant debate about the impact on one specific group: low-skilled native-born workers who did not complete high school. Some prominent economists, like George Borjas of Harvard, argue that this group has experienced significant wage declines due to competition from low-skilled immigrants [3]. Other economists, like Giovanni Peri of UC Davis, using different models, find that even for this group, the negative effects are minimal or are offset by other factors [4]. The general consensus now leans toward a small and concentrated negative impact on the wages of the lowest-skilled native workers, while the impact on all other workers is neutral to slightly positive.

### 2. Impact on Overall Economic Growth (GDP)

*   **The Prediction:** Economists have consistently predicted that immigration increases the overall size of the economy (total GDP).
*   **Accuracy:** This prediction is overwhelmingly accurate and uncontroversial. More workers and more consumers lead to more economic activity, which results in a larger GDP. Countries with higher immigration rates, like the United States, Canada, and Australia, have seen their economies grow as a direct result [5]. The more salient question economists now focus on is the impact on GDP *per capita*, which is a better measure of a country's standard of living. Here, the effects are generally found to be small but positive, particularly when immigration policy favors skilled workers.

### 3. Fiscal Impact (Taxes Paid vs. Services Used)

*   **The Prediction:** The fiscal impact of an immigrant is predicted to vary significantly based on their age, education, and skill level. High-skilled immigrants are predicted to be strong net fiscal contributors (paying much more in taxes than they consume in services), while low-skilled immigrants might be a net fiscal cost, especially in the short term.
*   **Accuracy:** This has been borne out by comprehensive studies. A landmark 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) confirmed these predictions with extensive data.
    *   Over a 75-year period, the average immigrant and their descendants are estimated to contribute a net positive of $259,000 to government budgets [6].
    *   However, first-generation immigrants are often more costly than native-born citizens, primarily due to lower initial earnings and the costs of educating their children.
    *   The children of these immigrants (the second generation) are among the strongest fiscal contributors in the population, out-earning and paying more in taxes than both their parents' generation and the average native-born citizen [6].
    *   Therefore, predictions that focus only on the short-term costs of first-generation, low-skilled immigrants can be misleadingly pessimistic. Long-term, multi-generational analyses show a clear fiscal benefit.

### 4. Impact on Innovation and Entrepreneurship

*   **The Prediction:** A growing body of economic research predicts that immigration, particularly high-skilled immigration, is a powerful driver of innovation and entrepreneurship.
*   **Accuracy:** The evidence strongly supports this prediction. Immigrants in the United States have historically been disproportionately innovative and entrepreneurial.
    *   Immigrants are nearly twice as likely to start a business as native-born citizens [5].
    *   As of 2022, immigrants had started more than half (319 of 582) of America's billion-dollar startup companies [7].
    *   Studies have shown a direct link between the number of H-1B visas (for skilled workers) and the number of patents filed in U.S. cities.

### Challenges in Prediction: The Mariel Boatlift Example

The difficulty in creating perfectly accurate predictions is illustrated by the famous Mariel boatlift of 1980, when 125,000 Cuban immigrants arrived in Miami in a short period.
*   **Initial Study (David Card, 1990):** Economist David Card compared Miami's labor market to similar cities and found no discernible negative effect on the wages or employment of low-skilled workers in Miami. This study became a cornerstone of the view that labor markets can absorb immigrant inflows smoothly.
*   **Re-examination (George Borjas, 2017):** Decades later, George Borjas re-analyzed the data, focusing more narrowly on men without a high school diploma, and concluded that the boatlift did, in fact, cause a sharp, short-term drop in their wages.
*   **The Debate:** This ongoing academic debate shows how sensitive predictions and analyses can be to the specific methodology and comparison group used [8]. It highlights that even with a clear natural experiment, pinpointing the exact effect can be challenging.

### Conclusion

Economists' predictions about immigration have become more sophisticated and, on the whole, have been reasonably accurate. The most robust and widely accepted conclusions are:

1.  **Immigration grows the overall economy.** This prediction is consistently accurate.
2.  **The long-term fiscal impact is positive.** While there are short-term costs, especially at local levels, immigrants and their descendants contribute more in taxes than they consume in services over their lifetimes.
3.  **Immigration is a significant driver of innovation and entrepreneurship.** This is particularly true for high-skilled immigration.
4.  **The average wage impact on native-born workers is minimal.** Where economists still debate is the magnitude of the negative impact on the small subgroup of native-born workers with the lowest skill levels.

In essence, the economic consensus has moved from a simple "supply and demand" framework to a more dynamic one that recognizes immigrants as consumers, entrepreneurs, and complements to the native-born workforce. The predictions have accurately captured the overall positive economic picture, while the debate continues on how the gains and costs are distributed across the population.

### Introduction to Economists' Predictions on Immigration

Economists have long debated the impacts of immigration on host economies, with predictions focusing on areas such as wages, employment, fiscal effects, and overall economic growth. Common predictions include the idea that immigration increases labor supply, potentially depressing wages for low-skilled native workers while boosting innovation, consumer demand, and GDP [1]. Other forecasts suggest minimal or even positive effects on natives' wages due to complementarity between immigrant and native labor [2]. These predictions are often based on theoretical models like the supply-and-demand framework or empirical studies of specific immigration events. However, their accuracy varies depending on context, methodology, and unforeseen factors like policy changes or economic conditions. This response evaluates the accuracy of these predictions by comparing them to empirical evidence from key studies and events, drawing on a range of sources.

### Predictions on Wage and Employment Effects

A prominent prediction among economists is that large influxes of low-skilled immigrants could lower wages and increase unemployment for similar native workers, as posited by labor economists like George Borjas. For instance, Borjas predicted that immigration to the U.S. from 1980‚Äì2000 reduced wages for high school dropouts by about 5‚Äì9% [3]. This aligns with basic economic theory: an increased labor supply shifts the supply curve rightward, reducing equilibrium wages.

However, empirical assessments have shown mixed accuracy. David Card's seminal 1990 study on the Mariel Boatlift‚Äîa sudden influx of 125,000 Cuban immigrants to Miami in 1980‚Äîpredicted and found no significant negative impact on native wages or employment, contradicting Borjas' framework [2]. Follow-up analyses largely confirmed Card's findings, suggesting his prediction was accurate for that context, as immigrants filled labor gaps without displacing natives [4]. In contrast, Borjas' predictions have been critiqued for overestimating negative effects; a 2017 reanalysis of the Mariel event by Borjas himself claimed a 10‚Äì30% wage drop for low-skilled workers, but this was disputed by other economists who argued his methodology selectively excluded data, reducing its reliability [4][5].

On employment, predictions often suggest short-term disruptions but long-term neutrality or gains. The National Academies of Sciences' 2017 report predicted that immigration has little to no effect on overall native employment rates, which has held up in U.S. data from 1990‚Äì2014, where native unemployment remained stable despite high immigration [1]. In Europe, predictions about the 2015‚Äì2016 refugee influx forecasted wage depression in countries like Germany, but actual outcomes showed minimal impacts, with some studies finding slight positive effects on native employment due to increased demand [6].

### Predictions on Fiscal and Broader Economic Impacts

Economists frequently predict that immigrants contribute positively to the economy over time, despite initial fiscal costs. For example, predictions from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 2013 estimated that comprehensive immigration reform would boost U.S. GDP by 3.3‚Äì5.4% over 20 years through increased labor force participation and productivity [7]. This has proven relatively accurate: post-2013 data shows immigrants contributing to GDP growth, with a 2020 study estimating they added $2 trillion to the U.S. economy annually [1]. However, fiscal predictions have been less precise; early models underestimated the net positive fiscal contributions of high-skilled immigrants while overestimating costs for low-skilled ones. The National Academies report found that first-generation immigrants cost states about $1,600 per person annually in net fiscal terms, but their children generate surpluses, aligning with long-term predictions but highlighting short-term inaccuracies [1].

In the UK, pre-Brexit predictions by economists like those from the London School of Economics forecasted that reduced EU immigration would harm GDP by 1‚Äì3% [8]. Post-Brexit data from 2016‚Äì2023 supports this, with estimates of a 2‚Äì2.5% GDP loss attributable to lower migration, indicating high accuracy [8]. Conversely, some optimistic predictions about innovation‚Äîe.g., that immigrants spur patenting and entrepreneurship‚Äîhave been borne out, with evidence showing immigrants are 80% more likely to start businesses than natives, accurately matching forecasts [9].

### Overall Assessment of Accuracy

Economists' predictions about immigration have been moderately accurate but are often contingent on assumptions that don't always hold in reality. Positive or neutral impact predictions (e.g., Card's) have generally fared better than pessimistic ones (e.g., Borjas'), with meta-analyses suggesting immigration's wage effects are small (0‚Äì4% depression for low-skilled natives) and fade over time [5]. Inaccuracies arise from methodological issues, such as failing to account for immigrants' self-selection into booming economies or natives' adaptive responses like upskilling [4]. Events like the COVID-19 pandemic further exposed limitations, as predictions didn't anticipate border closures' effects on labor shortages [6]. Overall, while predictions have improved with better data and models, they remain imperfect due to immigration's complexity, with accuracy rates in empirical validations ranging from 60‚Äì80% in reviewed studies [1][5].

In conclusion, economists' predictions are most accurate for long-term, aggregate effects like GDP growth, but less so for short-term, localized impacts on wages and employment. Policymakers should interpret them cautiously, integrating multiple perspectives for robustness.
