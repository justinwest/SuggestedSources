# ü§ñ Claude's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

Economists' predictions about immigration have shown mixed accuracy, with some fundamental insights proving correct while others have required significant revision as empirical evidence accumulated.

## Early Theoretical Predictions vs. Empirical Reality

Traditional economic theory predicted that immigration would depress wages for native workers, particularly those without college degrees, through increased labor supply. However, empirical studies have found much smaller effects than initially predicted. According to George Borjas's analysis, the actual wage effects of immigration on native workers have been more nuanced than early theoretical models suggested, with the impact varying significantly across different skill levels and time periods [1].

## Labor Market Complementarity

One area where economists' predictions have proven more accurate is in recognizing labor market complementarity. Economists correctly anticipated that immigrants and native workers often perform different types of jobs rather than directly competing for identical positions. This complementarity has helped explain why the predicted large-scale wage depression for native workers did not materialize to the extent initially forecasted [1].

## Fiscal Impact Predictions

Economists' predictions about the fiscal impact of immigration have been particularly challenging to assess accurately. Early models often failed to account for the complex, long-term nature of fiscal effects, including the significant contributions of second-generation immigrants. The actual fiscal impact has proven more positive than many initial predictions suggested, especially when considering the full lifecycle effects of immigrant families [1].

## Adaptation and Assimilation Rates

Economic predictions about immigrant adaptation and wage growth over time have shown reasonable accuracy. Economists correctly predicted that immigrant wages would converge toward native wages over time, though the speed of this convergence has varied across different immigrant cohorts and countries of origin [1].

## Limitations in Predictive Models

Several factors have limited the accuracy of economists' immigration predictions:

- **Dynamic effects**: Early models often treated labor markets as static, failing to account for how economies adjust and expand in response to immigration
- **Spatial considerations**: Predictions frequently underestimated the importance of geographic distribution and local labor market conditions
- **Skill complementarity**: Initial models oversimplified the relationship between immigrant and native worker skills
- **Long-term perspectives**: Many predictions focused on short-term effects while missing important long-term economic benefits [1]

## Methodological Improvements

As empirical methods have improved, economists have refined their predictions and developed more sophisticated models. Natural experiments and quasi-experimental approaches have provided better tools for testing theoretical predictions against real-world outcomes, leading to more accurate assessments of immigration's economic effects [1].

Overall, while economists' broad theoretical framework for understanding immigration has proven largely sound, specific quantitative predictions have often required substantial revision based on empirical evidence. The field has evolved toward more nuanced models that better capture the complexity of how immigration affects modern economies.

# ü§ñ Gemini's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

Economists' predictions about the economic impact of immigration have been accurate in some respects but highly contentious and less accurate in others, particularly concerning the magnitude of wage effects. The accuracy of a prediction often depends on the specific economic model used, the time frame considered, and which segment of the population is being examined [1, 3].

### The Standard Model and its Predictions
The standard "textbook" economic model of immigration, as described by economist George Borjas, makes several key predictions:
*   **A Small Net Economic Gain:** The model predicts that native-born citizens, as a whole, receive a net economic benefit from immigration, known as the "immigration surplus." This surplus is generated because immigration increases the supply of labor, which lowers wages for competing workers but increases returns for business owners and other capital holders. The gains to the capital owners are predicted to be slightly larger than the losses to the workers, resulting in a small net positive for the native population [1].
*   **Significant Redistribution of Wealth:** A crucial prediction of this model is that the distributional effects are much larger than the net gain. Wealth is effectively transferred from native workers who compete with immigrant labor (in the form of lower wages) to native employers and capital owners (in the form of higher profits). Borjas estimates this redistribution can be substantial, while the net surplus itself is a very small fraction of GDP, often less than 0.5% [1].

### Accuracy of the Predictions

1.  **Net Economic Gain (The Immigration Surplus):** The prediction that the overall net economic gain to the native population is small has largely been borne out by empirical evidence. Most studies find that the impact of immigration on the overall gross domestic product (GDP) is positive but modest, consistent with the small "immigration surplus" predicted by the models [1, 3]. However, Borjas argues that economists have often been misleading in their public communications by focusing on this small net gain while downplaying the more significant distributional consequences [1].

2.  **Wage and Employment Impacts (The Distributional Effects):** This is the most debated area. The accuracy of predictions about wage impacts depends heavily on which group of workers is studied and the methodology used.
    *   **The Critical View:** George Borjas argues that the model's prediction of wage depression for competing workers is accurate. His research suggests that immigration has significantly lowered the wages of native-born workers who did not complete high school‚Äîa group that directly competes with many low-skilled immigrants. He criticizes other economists for failing to find this effect, suggesting their methods are flawed [1].
    *   **The Minimal Impact View:** Other prominent economists, like David Card, have found very different results. Card's famous study of the 1980 Mariel boatlift, which brought a sudden influx of low-skilled Cuban workers to Miami, found no significant negative wage or employment effects on Miami's existing low-skilled workers [2]. This result directly challenges the simple textbook model's prediction. Research summarized by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) highlights Card's findings that native-born workers and immigrants are not perfect substitutes, and that local economies can adjust to labor influxes more smoothly than the simple model predicts [2].
    *   **The Consensus View:** A landmark 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) synthesized hundreds of studies to form a consensus view. It concluded that over a period of 10 years or more, the impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers is "very small." The report did find, however, that some groups‚Äîspecifically prior immigrants and native-born high school dropouts‚Äîcan experience negative short-run wage impacts. Overall, the NASEM report suggests that the negative wage effects predicted by the simplest models are often overstated or are limited to specific, smaller segments of the population in the short term [3].

3.  **Fiscal Impacts:** Predictions about the fiscal impact of immigration (taxes paid versus social services consumed) are also complex. The NASEM report found that the impact varies by generation.
    *   First-generation immigrants are, on average, more costly to governments than the native-born population, especially at the state and local levels [3].
    *   However, the children of immigrants (the second generation) are "among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the U.S. population," contributing more in taxes than their parents or other native-born Americans [3].
    Therefore, predictions focusing only on first-generation immigrants can be misleadingly pessimistic, while predictions that account for their children are much more positive.

In conclusion, economists' basic models were broadly accurate in predicting the *structure* of immigration's economic effects: a small overall net benefit combined with larger distributional shifts. However, the real-world *magnitude* of these effects, particularly the negative impact on native wages, remains a subject of intense debate. While some research aligns with the prediction of significant wage depression for low-skilled natives [1], a broader consensus suggests these effects are minimal for most natives in the long run [2, 3].

### Overview of Economists' Predictions on Immigration

Economists have long debated the impacts of immigration on host countries, particularly in terms of wages, employment, economic growth, and fiscal burdens. Predictions often stem from theoretical models like the supply-and-demand framework, where an influx of immigrants is expected to increase labor supply, potentially lowering wages for competing native workers while boosting overall productivity and innovation [1]. These predictions vary by context, such as skill levels of immigrants and the host economy's structure. For instance, in the United States, economists in the 1980s and 1990s anticipated that large-scale immigration would depress wages for low-skilled natives, widen income inequality, and impose short-term fiscal costs, but yield long-term benefits through economic expansion [2]. However, the accuracy of these predictions has been mixed, with empirical evidence often challenging or qualifying initial forecasts. This response evaluates the accuracy based on key areas, drawing from historical predictions and subsequent studies.

### Accuracy in Predicting Wage and Employment Effects

A central prediction among economists, particularly those like George Borjas, was that immigration would harm low-skilled native workers by increasing competition and reducing wages. For example, Borjas estimated in the 1990s that immigration reduced the wages of high school dropouts by about 5-9% [1]. This view was echoed in predictions for the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, where economists foresaw wage suppression in sectors like agriculture and construction [3].

However, empirical assessments have shown these predictions to be only partially accurate. The 2016 National Academies report reviewed decades of data and found that while immigration may cause small wage declines (around 1-3%) for low-skilled natives in the short term, these effects are often temporary and offset by broader economic gains, such as increased consumer demand and business formation [2]. Notably, David Card's study of the 1980 Mariel Boatlift‚Äîa sudden influx of Cuban immigrants to Miami‚Äîfound no significant negative impact on native wages or unemployment, contradicting supply-shock predictions [4]. Borjas himself later critiqued such findings but acknowledged in his work that predictions overestimated harms due to factors like native worker mobility and skill complementarity [1]. Overall, predictions of severe, widespread wage depression have proven overstated, with accuracy improving when models account for dynamic adjustments like capital investment and immigrant assimilation.

### Accuracy in Predicting Economic Growth and Innovation

Economists have generally predicted positive long-term effects on economic growth, arguing that immigrants fill labor gaps, start businesses, and drive innovation. For instance, predictions from the 1990s suggested that immigration could add 0.1-0.5% to annual GDP growth in the US by enhancing productivity [2]. These have largely held up: the National Academies report confirmed that immigration contributes positively to GDP per capita over time, with high-skilled immigrants particularly boosting innovation (e.g., via patents and entrepreneurship) [2]. A 2020 study by the Migration Policy Institute reinforced this, showing immigrants founded 45% of Fortune 500 companies, aligning with optimistic forecasts [5].

That said, some predictions underestimated challenges in low-growth periods. During the 2008 financial crisis, economists like those at the Brookings Institution predicted quicker recovery boosts from immigration, but actual outcomes were muted due to reduced immigrant inflows and integration barriers [3]. Accuracy here is higher for long-term growth but less so for short-term fluctuations.

### Accuracy in Predicting Fiscal Impacts

Fiscal predictions have often highlighted short-term costs (e.g., education and welfare for low-skilled immigrants) outweighing tax contributions, with net benefits emerging after decades [1]. Borjas, in his analysis, predicted that the average immigrant imposes a fiscal burden of about $20,000-$50,000 over their lifetime, based on 1990s data [1]. However, these have been critiqued for inaccuracy. The National Academies found that while first-generation immigrants may cost more in services, their children contribute positively, leading to a net fiscal surplus over 75 years [2]. A 2017 OECD report across multiple countries showed similar patterns, with predictions of fiscal drains often exaggerated due to overlooking immigrants' higher workforce participation [6]. In Europe, predictions for the 2015 refugee influx anticipated massive costs, but studies like those from the IMF indicate smaller-than-expected burdens when integration is effective [7].

### Factors Influencing Prediction Accuracy and Lessons Learned

The accuracy of economists' predictions has improved over time with better data and methodologies, such as longitudinal studies and natural experiments [4]. Early models often failed to account for endogeneity (e.g., immigrants self-selecting into booming economies) or spillover effects like native upskilling [1]. Borjas notes in his work that many predictions were "narratives" shaped by assumptions rather than robust evidence, leading to overstatements of negative impacts [1]. Conversely, more optimistic predictions (e.g., from Card) have been vindicated in specific cases but not universally [4].

In summary, economists' predictions about immigration have been moderately accurate for long-term growth and innovation but less so for short-term wage and fiscal effects, where harms were frequently overstated. This underscores the need for nuanced, context-specific models. Ongoing research continues to refine these insights, particularly amid global migration trends.

# ü§ñ Claude's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

Economists' predictions about immigration have shown a mixed track record, with some forecasts proving accurate while others have been significantly off the mark. The accuracy varies considerably depending on the specific aspect of immigration being predicted, the time horizon, and the methodology used.

## Labor Market Impact Predictions

One of the most contentious areas has been predicting immigration's effects on wages and employment. Early economic models from the 1980s and 1990s predicted that immigration would substantially depress wages for native workers, particularly those without college degrees [1]. However, subsequent empirical research has shown these predictions were largely overstated. The actual wage effects have been found to be much smaller than initially forecasted, with some studies finding minimal or even positive effects on native wages [2].

The National Academy of Sciences' comprehensive 2016 report found that immigration's impact on wages was more nuanced than many economists had predicted, with effects varying significantly by skill level, time period, and geographic location [3]. First-generation immigrants were found to have more negative fiscal impacts than predicted, while second and third generations showed more positive contributions than initially forecasted.

## Fiscal Impact Predictions

Economists' predictions about immigration's fiscal effects have been particularly problematic. Many early studies underestimated the complexity of measuring fiscal impacts across different levels of government and time horizons [4]. Predictions from the 1990s about the fiscal burden of immigration proved overly pessimistic in many cases, failing to account for immigrants' long-term economic integration and the tax contributions of their children.

The Congressional Budget Office's projections about immigration's fiscal impact have generally been more accurate than academic predictions, though they still struggle with long-term forecasting beyond 10-year windows [5].

## Economic Growth Predictions

Economists have been more successful in predicting immigration's positive effects on economic growth, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Predictions about immigrants' contributions to patent creation, business formation, and overall economic dynamism have generally proven accurate or even conservative [6]. The forecasted positive relationship between immigration and innovation has been consistently supported by empirical evidence.

## Demographic and Social Predictions

Economic predictions about immigration's demographic impacts have shown mixed accuracy. While economists correctly predicted that immigration would help address aging populations in developed countries, they often underestimated the challenges of economic integration and overestimated the speed of wage convergence between immigrant and native workers [7].

## Methodological Limitations

Several factors have contributed to prediction failures. Many economists relied on static models that failed to account for economic adaptation, policy changes, and dynamic market responses [8]. The assumption of perfect labor market competition and immediate wage adjustments proved unrealistic. Additionally, most predictions focused on short-term effects while ignoring longer-term adjustments and intergenerational impacts.

## Recent Improvements

More recent economic research has improved prediction accuracy by incorporating better data, more sophisticated modeling techniques, and recognition of heterogeneous effects across different immigrant groups and time periods [9]. Modern economists increasingly acknowledge the limitations of making broad predictions about immigration's economic effects without considering specific contexts and policy frameworks.

# ü§ñ Gemini's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

Economists' predictions about immigration have a mixed record of accuracy, largely because the economic effects of immigration are complex, multifaceted, and dependent on a wide range of variables. Early, simplistic models often yielded predictions that were not fully borne out by empirical evidence. However, as economic models have grown more sophisticated, incorporating dynamic effects and differentiating between types of immigrants, their predictive power has improved significantly.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the accuracy of economists' predictions across several key areas:

### 1. Labor Market Impacts: Wages and Employment

This is the most contentious and widely studied area of immigration economics.

*   **The Simple Prediction:** The most basic economic model of labor markets treats labor as a simple commodity. An increase in the supply of labor (from immigration) is predicted to lower the equilibrium wage for native-born workers who compete for the same jobs (substitutes). For decades, this model fueled predictions that a large influx of low-skilled immigrants would significantly depress the wages of low-skilled native workers.

*   **Accuracy and Nuance:** This simple prediction has proven to be largely inaccurate or, at best, an oversimplification. The overwhelming majority of empirical studies find that the negative wage effect of immigration on native-born workers is very small, close to zero, and in many cases, statistically insignificant [1, 2]. Several factors, which more sophisticated models now incorporate, explain this discrepancy:
    *   **Complementarity:** Immigrants often complement native labor rather than substitute for it. For example, low-skilled immigrant laborers on a construction site may increase the demand and wages for higher-skilled native supervisors, architects, and electricians. Similarly, high-skilled immigrants in tech can create new companies and job opportunities for a wide range of native workers [3].
    *   **Demand Creation:** Immigrants are not just workers; they are also consumers. They rent apartments, buy groceries, and use services, which increases overall economic demand and creates jobs, offsetting the initial labor supply shock.
    *   **Capital Response:** Capital is not fixed. When labor becomes more abundant and cheaper, firms are incentivized to invest in new machinery, factories, and businesses to take advantage of it, which in turn boosts demand for labor in the long run.
    *   **Native Worker Adaptation:** Native workers may respond to immigration by specializing in tasks that require more communication and language skills, where they have a comparative advantage, leaving more manual tasks to immigrants.

The most famous academic debate on this topic centers on the 1980 Mariel Boatlift, when 125,000 Cubans arrived in Miami. Economist David Card's initial study found no discernible negative wage effect on Miami's low-skilled workers compared to other cities [4]. Economist George Borjas later challenged this, using different data and methodologies, and argued there was a significant negative wage impact on the least-educated Miamians [5]. This ongoing debate highlights that even with the same event, economists' conclusions can differ based on their assumptions and methods, making clear-cut "predictions" difficult.

**Verdict:** The simple prediction of large negative wage impacts was inaccurate. More nuanced models predicting small, localized, or zero effects have proven far more consistent with the evidence.

### 2. Fiscal Impacts: Taxes vs. Public Services

*   **The Prediction:** Economists have long predicted that the fiscal impact of an immigrant depends heavily on their age, education, and income level. High-skilled, working-age immigrants are predicted to be significant net fiscal contributors, paying more in taxes (income, payroll, consumption) than they consume in public services. Conversely, low-skilled immigrants, refugees, and elderly immigrants are predicted to be net fiscal costs, at least initially, as they may pay less in taxes while consuming services like public education, healthcare, and welfare.

*   **Accuracy and Nuance:** These predictions have proven to be highly accurate. A landmark 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) confirmed this framework. It found that:
    *   The first generation of immigrants tends to be more costly to governments, primarily at the state and local levels where education costs for their children are concentrated [6].
    *   However, the children of immigrants (the second generation) are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population, often surpassing the contributions of the native-born population [6].
    *   Over the long term (a 75-year projection), the net fiscal impact of immigration is strongly positive, largely driven by the future contributions of immigrants and their descendants [6].

**Verdict:** Predictions about fiscal impacts, when broken down by immigrant characteristics and timeframe, have been very accurate.

### 3. Overall Economic Growth (GDP)

*   **The Prediction:** A virtually unanimous prediction among economists is that immigration increases the total size of the economy (Gross Domestic Product). By increasing the number of workers and consumers, immigration directly contributes to higher economic output.

*   **Accuracy and Nuance:** This prediction is unequivocally accurate. An economy with more people producing and consuming is a larger economy. The more sophisticated question is about the effect on *GDP per capita*. Here, the prediction is that high-skilled immigration, in particular, boosts GDP per capita by increasing innovation and productivity. Evidence strongly supports this, as immigrants are disproportionately likely to found companies (including many in the Fortune 500), file patents, and work in STEM fields, all of which drive productivity growth that benefits the entire population [3, 7].

**Verdict:** Predictions about immigration's positive effect on total GDP have been completely accurate. Predictions about high-skilled immigration's positive effect on per-capita GDP have also been well-supported by evidence.

### 4. Inflation

*   **The Prediction:** This is a more recent area of focus. The classical view might suggest that more people demanding goods could be inflationary. However, the more dominant modern prediction is that immigration can be *disinflationary* or help to moderate inflation. The reasoning is that immigrants alleviate labor shortages, a key driver of wage-push inflation. By filling jobs in sectors with worker shortages (like construction, hospitality, and care), immigrants increase the economy's productive capacity, allowing supply to meet demand without sharp price increases [8].

*   **Accuracy and Nuance:** Recent evidence, particularly from the post-COVID economic recovery, has strongly supported this prediction. As central banks raised interest rates to fight inflation, a surge in immigration in countries like the U.S. and Canada helped fill a record number of job openings. This allowed the economy to grow and add jobs without triggering the "wage-price spiral" that many had feared, contributing to the "soft landing" scenario [8, 9].

**Verdict:** While a newer area of focus, the prediction that immigration can help moderate inflation by easing labor market tightness has proven accurate in the recent economic environment.

### Conclusion

The accuracy of economists' predictions about immigration has evolved.

*   **Least Accurate:** Early, static models predicting significant harm to native wages have not held up to broad empirical scrutiny. The U.S. and other nations have absorbed historically large immigrant flows without the widespread wage depression that was once feared.
*   **Most Accurate:** Predictions regarding the positive impact on overall GDP, the strong correlation between an immigrant's skill level and their net fiscal contribution, and the outsized role of skilled immigrants in driving innovation have been consistently and strongly confirmed by data.

In essence, economists have become more accurate as their models have moved away from a simple view of immigrants as just "more labor" and toward a more dynamic understanding of them as workers, consumers, entrepreneurs, and parents whose long-term contributions shape the economy in complex and generally positive ways.

### Introduction

Economists have long made predictions about the impacts of immigration on host economies, drawing on theoretical models such as supply-and-demand frameworks, human capital theories, and general equilibrium models. These predictions often focus on areas like labor markets (e.g., wages and employment), fiscal balances (tax contributions versus public service costs), economic growth, and innovation. However, the accuracy of these predictions has been mixed, influenced by factors such as the skill levels of immigrants, the economic context of the host country, policy environments, and unforeseen dynamics like assimilation rates or technological changes. Empirical studies sometimes confirm predictions, while others reveal overestimations of negative effects or underestimations of positives. This response evaluates accuracy across key domains, primarily based on U.S. and European contexts where most rigorous research exists, highlighting both consensus and debates.

### Labor Market Impacts

Economists commonly predict that immigration increases labor supply, potentially depressing wages and employment for native workers, especially low-skilled ones, due to competition [1]. For instance, standard models like those from George Borjas suggest that a 10% increase in labor supply from immigration could reduce wages for competing natives by 3-4% [2]. However, actual outcomes have often shown these predictions to be overstated or inaccurate.

A landmark case is the 1980 Mariel Boatlift, where 125,000 Cuban immigrants arrived in Miami. Pre-event predictions and some models anticipated significant wage drops for low-skilled workers. Yet, David Card's seminal study found no adverse effects on native wages or unemployment, attributing this to economic adjustments like industry shifts and increased demand [3]. Subsequent reanalyses have debated this: Borjas' 2017 critique argued for a 10-30% wage decline among high-school dropouts, suggesting Card's findings underestimated negatives due to sample issues [2]. Overall, meta-analyses indicate that immigration's wage effects are small (often -1% to +1% for natives) and dissipate over time, with high-skilled immigration even boosting wages through complementarity [1][4]. In Europe, predictions about the 2004 EU enlargement (e.g., mass migration from Eastern to Western Europe) forecasted unemployment spikes in countries like the UK. While short-term pressures occurred, long-term studies show minimal native job displacement and even productivity gains, contradicting dire predictions [5].

Accuracy here is moderate: Negative predictions often overestimate harms, especially when ignoring dynamic responses like native upskilling or firm investments. Positive predictions (e.g., on innovation from skilled migrants) have fared better, with evidence showing immigrants contribute disproportionately to patents and entrepreneurship [4].

### Fiscal and Public Finance Impacts

Predictions often claim immigrants are a fiscal drain, consuming more in public services (education, healthcare, welfare) than they pay in taxes, particularly for low-skilled or humanitarian migrants [1]. For example, early 1990s U.S. estimates predicted net fiscal costs of $20-50 billion annually from immigration [2]. In contrast, optimistic models foresee net gains from young, working-age immigrants who contribute over their lifetimes.

Empirical accuracy varies by context. The 2017 National Academies report found that first-generation immigrants in the U.S. impose a net fiscal cost (about $1,600 per immigrant annually at the state/local level), but their descendants generate surpluses, leading to long-term net positives [1]. This partially confirms pessimistic short-term predictions but refutes them over generations. In Europe, predictions for refugee inflows (e.g., post-2015 Syrian crisis) anticipated high welfare costs; actual data from Sweden and Germany show initial burdens but eventual tax contributions as integration progresses, with costs lower than predicted due to labor market participation [5]. However, in low-growth economies or with poor integration policies, negative fiscal predictions have been more accurate, as seen in some U.S. states with high unauthorized immigration [2].

Overall, predictions tend to be less accurate for long-term horizons, often underestimating immigrants' upward mobility and overestimating dependency on public services [1][4].

### Economic Growth and Other Effects

Broader predictions posit that immigration boosts GDP through labor force expansion and innovation, with estimates like a 1% immigration increase raising GDP per capita by 0.5-2% [4]. These have generally been accurate: U.S. studies show immigration added 0.5-1% to annual GDP growth from 1990-2010 [1]. Predictions of innovation spillovers are supported by evidence that immigrants file 30-50% more patents per capita than natives [4].

However, some predictions fail to account for nuances. For instance, forecasts of cultural or social costs (e.g., reduced social cohesion affecting productivity) have limited empirical support, with most studies finding neutral or positive effects on trust and diversity-driven growth [5]. In developing countries, predictions of "brain drain" harming origin economies have been partially accurate but overstated, as remittances and return migration often offset losses [4].

### Conclusion

Economists' predictions about immigration are accurate in broad strokes‚Äîsuch as overall GDP benefits and short-term fiscal pressures‚Äîbut often inaccurate in magnitude and direction, particularly for labor market harms, which are frequently exaggerated. This stems from model assumptions that overlook adaptations like technological change or policy interventions. Consensus has grown toward viewing immigration as net positive economically [1][4], though debates persist, especially on distributional effects (e.g., low-skilled natives). Future predictions could improve with better data on unauthorized flows and integration dynamics. Policymakers should weigh these insights cautiously, recognizing that accuracy improves with context-specific, empirical testing over theoretical models alone.
