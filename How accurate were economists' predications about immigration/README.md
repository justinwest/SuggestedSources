# ü§ñ Claude's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

Economists' predictions about immigration have shown significant inaccuracies, particularly in several key areas including fiscal impacts, labor market effects, and integration outcomes.

## Labor Market Predictions

One of the most notable failures was economists' predictions about labor market competition. Many economists initially predicted that immigration would have minimal effects on native workers' wages and employment, based on theoretical models assuming perfect labor mobility and market clearing [1]. However, empirical evidence has shown more complex dynamics, with some studies finding significant wage depression in certain sectors and skill levels, particularly affecting workers without college degrees.

The consensus among economists has shifted over time as more data became available. Earlier predictions often underestimated the heterogeneous effects across different skill groups and geographic regions [1].

## Fiscal Impact Miscalculations

Economists' predictions about the fiscal impact of immigration have been particularly problematic. Many early analyses failed to account for the full spectrum of costs and benefits over time [2]. Research has shown that fiscal impacts vary dramatically by country of origin, skill level, and time horizon, factors that were often oversimplified in earlier economic models [3].

The complexity of calculating net fiscal contributions was underestimated, with economists initially focusing too heavily on tax contributions while underestimating the full range of public service costs, including education, healthcare, and infrastructure [2].

## Integration and Long-term Outcomes

Economic predictions about integration rates and long-term economic mobility have also proven inaccurate in many cases. Economists often assumed relatively uniform integration patterns across different immigrant groups, but evidence suggests significant variation based on country of origin, initial skill levels, and receiving community characteristics [3].

## Methodological Limitations

The inaccuracies in economists' predictions can be attributed to several methodological issues:

- **Oversimplified models**: Early economic models often failed to capture the complexity of labor markets and social systems [2]
- **Data limitations**: Insufficient longitudinal data led to incomplete understanding of long-term effects
- **Assumption flaws**: Models often relied on assumptions about perfect competition and mobility that don't reflect real-world conditions [1]

## Evolution of Understanding

The field has gradually improved its predictive accuracy as methodologies have become more sophisticated and data availability has increased. Modern analyses increasingly recognize the importance of disaggregating effects by skill level, geographic region, and time horizon [3].

However, significant challenges remain in making accurate predictions about immigration's economic effects, particularly given the complex interplay of economic, social, and political factors that influence outcomes.

Based on the provided sources, economists' predictions about immigration have often been inaccurate or incomplete, tending towards over-optimism by focusing on aggregate benefits while downplaying significant negative impacts on specific segments of the population and public finances [2, 1]. The predictions were frequently flawed because they relied on broad averages that masked crucial details about wage competition, fiscal costs, and the composition of immigrant groups [1, 3].

Key areas where predictions fell short include:

**1. Impact on Wages for Low-Skilled Workers**
Many mainstream economic predictions suggested that immigration had little to no negative effect on the wages of native-born workers [2]. However, this consensus has been challenged as being inaccurate, particularly for the lowest-paid workers.

*   **Theoretical Prediction vs. Empirical Findings:** Economist George J. Borjas argues that basic supply-and-demand models correctly predict that a large influx of low-skilled immigrant labor will lower the wages of competing low-skilled native workers. He contends that the failure was not in the economic theory itself, but in many empirical studies that, due to methodological choices like analyzing large geographic areas, diluted and failed to detect this downward wage pressure. In his view, the debate should be about the *magnitude* of the wage loss for this group, not its existence [1].
*   **Real-World Evidence:** In the UK, critics like Matthew Goodwin point out that while economists promised minimal wage impact, organizations like the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee later acknowledged that record-breaking immigration had put downward pressure on the wages of lower-paid workers [2]. Research for the Bank of England confirmed that while the overall wage effect was small, there was a negative impact on wages in the semi-skilled and unskilled service sectors [4].

**2. Fiscal Impact and Public Services**
Predictions often claimed that immigration provided a net fiscal benefit, with immigrants contributing more in taxes than they consumed in services. This has proven to be an oversimplification that is highly dependent on the immigrants' country of origin and skill level [2, 3].

*   **The Flaw of Averages:** A Danish government study, summarized by Emil Kirkegaard, provides a detailed breakdown of the fiscal impact of immigrants by their country of origin. It found that the fiscal effect varies dramatically. Immigrants from Western countries and their descendants provided a significant net fiscal contribution. In stark contrast, immigrants from MENAPT countries (Middle East, North Africa, Pakistan, and Turkey) and their descendants represented a major net fiscal cost [3]. This demonstrates that broad, optimistic predictions based on an "average" immigrant are misleading. The overall fiscal outcome depends entirely on the *composition* of the immigrant population, a detail many predictions ignored [3].
*   **Strain on Public Services:** Economists were also criticized for failing to predict or account for the immense strain that a rapid, large-scale increase in population places on public services like healthcare, schools, and housing. These "second-order" effects were often absent from models that focused narrowly on labor markets and aggregate GDP [2].

**3. The Disconnect Between Aggregate Growth and Individual Prosperity**
A central failure in many economic predictions was the focus on aggregate GDP growth while ignoring GDP per capita. While immigration can increase the overall size of an economy, this does not necessarily make the average citizen better off. Goodwin notes that for much of the 2000s in the UK, strong headline GDP growth coincided with stagnant or falling GDP per capita, meaning the economic pie was bigger, but individual slices were smaller [2]. Economists were criticized for presenting the aggregate figure as an unqualified success without explaining these distributional consequences [2, 1].

In conclusion, the predictions of many economists regarding immigration were inaccurate primarily because they were based on incomplete models. They often downplayed the theoretically predictable negative wage effects on the low-skilled, used misleading averages that concealed vast differences in fiscal impacts between immigrant groups, and failed to account for the pressures that the scale of migration placed on public services and per-capita prosperity [1, 2, 3].

    *   Borjas argues that standard economic supply-and-demand models correctly predict that immigration of low-skilled workers will lower the wages of competing native-born workers.

This highlights the failure of predictions based on simple averages.

# ü§ñ Grok's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

Economists have long made predictions about the economic impacts of immigration, focusing on areas such as wages, employment, fiscal contributions, and overall economic growth. These predictions often stem from theoretical models, empirical studies, and policy analyses. However, their accuracy has varied significantly depending on the context (e.g., country, type of immigration, and time period), the assumptions underlying the models, and unforeseen factors like policy changes or global events. In this response, I evaluate the accuracy of these predictions by examining key claims, empirical evidence from provided and additional sources, and areas of consensus or debate. Overall, while some predictions‚Äîsuch as limited short-term wage depression for natives‚Äîhave held up reasonably well, others, particularly on long-term fiscal impacts and labor market integration, have proven overly optimistic or inaccurate, leading to criticism of economists' forecasting reliability.

### Key Predictions and Their Accuracy

#### 1. Wage and Employment Effects on Natives
A common prediction among economists is that immigration has a small or negligible negative effect on native wages and employment, especially in the short term, due to factors like labor market complementarity (immigrants filling roles natives avoid) and economic growth spurred by increased labor supply [4]. For instance, David Card's influential 1990 study on the Mariel Boatlift‚Äîa sudden influx of Cuban immigrants to Miami in 1980‚Äîpredicted and found no significant wage decline for low-skilled natives, attributing this to rapid absorption into the economy [4].

- **Accuracy Assessment**: This prediction has been moderately accurate in specific cases but contested in others. Follow-up analyses, including by George Borjas, re-examined the Mariel data and found evidence of wage suppression for high school dropouts (a 10-30% drop in relative wages), suggesting Card's optimistic view underestimated impacts on vulnerable groups [1][5]. Broader meta-analyses, such as a 2016 National Academies of Sciences report, confirm that immigration's wage effects are small overall (e.g., a 1-2% reduction for low-skilled natives over a decade) but can be more pronounced in localized or high-immigration scenarios [5]. In the UK context, pre-Brexit predictions by economists like those from the London School of Economics often downplayed wage harms, but post-2016 data showed mixed results, with some sectors experiencing downward pressure [2]. Overall, predictions have been accurate for aggregate effects but less so for distributional impacts on low-wage workers.

#### 2. Fiscal Impacts and Public Finances
Economists frequently predict that immigrants, particularly skilled ones, contribute positively to public finances through taxes and lower welfare usage, offsetting costs like education and healthcare for their children [3][5]. For example, models from the OECD and others have projected net fiscal benefits from immigration in high-income countries, assuming immigrants integrate quickly and boost productivity [6].

- **Accuracy Assessment**: These predictions have often been inaccurate or overly optimistic, especially for non-selective immigration from lower-income countries. Emil Kirkegaard's analysis of Danish data shows stark variations by origin: immigrants from Western countries contribute positively (e.g., +‚Ç¨50,000 lifetime net fiscal impact), while those from the Middle East and Africa impose net costs (e.g., -‚Ç¨200,000 or more), due to lower employment rates and higher welfare dependency [3]. This aligns with Borjas's work, which critiques optimistic fiscal models for ignoring long-term costs like family reunification and skill mismatches, leading to underestimations of net drains on public budgets [1]. In the UK, economists' pre-2010 predictions of fiscal neutrality or benefits from EU migration were contradicted by later studies showing a net fiscal cost of ¬£6.4 billion annually for non-EEA immigrants (due to lower earnings and higher public service use) [2]. A 2022 OECD report acknowledges that while skilled immigration often yields fiscal surpluses, low-skilled or humanitarian flows frequently do not, highlighting how predictions failed to account for integration challenges [6]. Accuracy improves when models incorporate origin-specific data, but broad generalizations have proven unreliable.

#### 3. Overall Economic Growth and Productivity
Many economists predict that immigration boosts GDP growth by expanding the labor force, fostering innovation, and filling skill gaps. For instance, projections from the U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimate that increased immigration could add $7 trillion to U.S. GDP over a decade through higher productivity [7].

- **Accuracy Assessment**: These predictions have generally been accurate at the macro level but with caveats. Empirical evidence from the U.S. and Europe supports modest GDP gains (e.g., 0.5-1% annual growth boost from immigration), as seen in studies of historical waves like post-WWII European migration [5]. However, critics argue that per capita growth‚Äîthe more relevant metric for natives‚Äîoften stagnates or declines due to population dilution effects [1][2]. In the UK, economists' forecasts of immigration-driven growth post-EU enlargement (2004) were partially validated by a 2-3% GDP increase, but this masked productivity stagnation and regional inequalities [2]. Kirkegaard's data further shows that while some immigrant groups enhance productivity, others do not, leading to overestimations in non-selective systems [3]. Predictions have been less accurate in predicting backlash effects, such as political responses (e.g., Brexit), which economists largely failed to anticipate [2].

### Factors Contributing to Inaccuracies
Several issues undermine the accuracy of economists' predictions:
- **Model Assumptions**: Many rely on "perfect integration" assumptions that overlook cultural, educational, and discrimination barriers [1][3].
- **Data Limitations**: Early predictions often used aggregate data, missing subgroup variations (e.g., by skill level or origin) [3][5].
- **External Shocks**: Events like recessions or policy shifts (e.g., welfare reforms) can alter outcomes, as seen in the 2008 financial crisis amplifying fiscal costs [2].
- **Consensus Bias**: A perceived "pro-immigration" bias in academia may lead to downplaying negatives, as critiqued in sources highlighting "failure" in forecasting [2].

In summary, economists' predictions about immigration have been accurate in highlighting broad benefits like GDP growth and minimal average wage effects but have often erred on fiscal impacts and distributional consequences, particularly for low-skilled immigration. Greater accuracy emerges from nuanced, data-driven approaches that account for heterogeneity. For policymakers, this underscores the need for selective immigration policies to align outcomes with predictions.

# ü§ñ Claude's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

Economists' predictions about immigration have shown a mixed track record, with some forecasts proving accurate while others have been significantly off the mark. The accuracy varies considerably depending on the specific aspect of immigration being predicted, the time horizon, and the methodological approaches used.

## Labor Market Impact Predictions

One of the most extensively studied areas has been immigration's effect on wages and employment. Early economic models from the 1980s and 1990s predicted that immigration would substantially depress wages for native workers, particularly those without college degrees [1]. However, subsequent empirical research has found these effects to be much smaller than initially predicted. David Card's seminal work on the Mariel boatlift found virtually no impact on Miami's labor market despite a sudden 7% increase in the workforce [2].

More recent consensus among economists suggests that immigration has minimal negative effects on native wages in the long run, with some studies finding small positive effects [3]. The National Academy of Sciences' comprehensive 2016 report concluded that first-generation immigrants typically impose a net fiscal cost, but subsequent generations contribute positively to government budgets [4].

## Demographic and Fiscal Projections

Economists have had better success predicting immigration's demographic impacts. Projections about immigration's role in offsetting aging populations in developed countries have largely proven accurate [5]. The Congressional Budget Office's predictions about immigration's positive impact on Social Security solvency have also been generally on target [6].

However, fiscal impact predictions have been more challenging. Early estimates often underestimated the costs of providing services to immigrant families while sometimes overestimating tax contributions. The complexity of measuring second and third-generation effects has made long-term fiscal projections particularly difficult [7].

## Economic Integration Patterns

Economists' predictions about immigrant economic assimilation have shown mixed accuracy. Traditional models suggested steady convergence between immigrant and native earnings over time, which has held true for some groups but not others [8]. The prediction that higher-skilled immigrants would integrate more quickly economically has generally proven correct, though the timeline has varied significantly by country of origin and destination [9].

## Limitations and Methodological Challenges

Several factors have limited the accuracy of economists' immigration predictions:

**Data constraints**: Immigration flows are often irregular and difficult to measure accurately, particularly undocumented immigration [10]. This makes baseline assumptions challenging to establish.

**Dynamic effects**: Economic models often struggle to capture how immigration changes the structure of the economy itself, including entrepreneurship effects and innovation spillovers [11].

**Policy changes**: Frequent shifts in immigration policy make long-term predictions difficult, as the composition and volume of immigration flows change with policy regimes [12].

**Local variation**: National-level predictions often miss significant regional and local variations in immigration impacts, which can be substantial [13].

## Recent Developments

More recent economic research has moved toward more nuanced, localized analyses that better account for complementarity between immigrant and native workers. These approaches have shown improved predictive accuracy compared to earlier aggregate models [14]. Machine learning and big data approaches are also beginning to improve prediction accuracy by better capturing complex interactions [15].

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted both the importance of immigration for economic recovery and the difficulty of predicting immigration flows during major disruptions [16]. Many pre-pandemic projections about immigration levels and economic impacts had to be substantially revised.

# ü§ñ Gemini's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

Economists' predictions about immigration have been a mixed bag, demonstrating accuracy in some broad areas while being less precise or even incorrect on more specific, distributional effects. The accuracy often depends on the simplicity of the economic model used versus the complex, dynamic reality of how an economy absorbs new people.

### 1. Areas of Relative Accuracy

Economists were largely correct in predicting the macroeconomic benefits of immigration. The foundational principles of economics suggest that increasing the supply of a key input‚Äîlabor‚Äîwill increase the overall output of an economy.

*   **Overall Economic Growth (GDP):** The most robust and accurate prediction is that immigration increases the total size of the economy. Immigrants are both workers and consumers; they fill jobs, pay taxes, and purchase goods and services, all of which contribute to a higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A landmark 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine confirmed that immigration is integral to the nation‚Äôs economic growth, primarily by increasing the labor force [1].
*   **Labor Supply:** Predictions that immigrants would expand the labor supply, particularly in sectors facing shortages, have been proven correct. Immigrants are disproportionately represented in both high-skill STEM fields and in essential, physically demanding jobs like agriculture, construction, and hospitality [2]. This expansion of the labor pool allows the economy to produce more than it otherwise could.
*   **Innovation and Entrepreneurship:** Economists who predicted that immigration would be a catalyst for innovation and business formation have also been vindicated. Studies consistently show that immigrants are more likely to start businesses than their native-born counterparts. This entrepreneurial activity creates jobs for everyone and contributes to economic dynamism [1, 3].

### 2. Areas of Inaccuracy and Intense Debate

The primary area where economic predictions have been less accurate, or at least highly contentious, is the impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers, especially those with lower levels of education.

*   **Wages of Native-Born Workers:** The simple "textbook" supply-and-demand model predicts that a large influx of low-skilled labor will increase competition and drive down the wages of low-skilled native-born workers. The reality has proven far more complex, and economists are fiercely divided on the magnitude of this effect.
    *   **The "No Effect" Camp:** A seminal 1990 study by David Card examined the 1980 Mariel Boatlift, when 125,000 Cuban immigrants (many of whom were low-skilled) arrived in Miami. He found no discernible negative impact on the wages or employment of low-skilled workers in Miami compared to other similar cities [4]. This and subsequent research suggest that economies are dynamic: capital flows to where labor is plentiful, immigrants create new demand, and immigrant labor can often *complement* native labor rather than substitute for it (e.g., an immigrant construction crew creates a job for a native-born site manager) [2].
    *   **The "Negative Effect" Camp:** In contrast, economist George Borjas of Harvard University has argued that looking only at a single city is misleading, as native workers may move out in response to immigration, spreading the wage impact across the country. His national-level research suggests that immigration has had a significant negative effect on the wages of one specific group: native-born high school dropouts. He estimates that immigration from 1980 to 2000 may have reduced their wages by as much as 5% [5].
    *   **The Consensus View:** Most empirical studies find that the overall effect of immigration on native-born wages is very small‚Äîeither slightly positive or slightly negative‚Äîand close to zero. However, there is a consensus that for the small group of native-born workers who did not finish high school and are in direct competition with low-skilled immigrants, there is likely a modest negative wage effect in the short run [1, 6]. The initial, simple prediction of a large, widespread wage decline for low-skilled workers was therefore inaccurate because it failed to account for the economy's complex adjustment mechanisms.

*   **Fiscal Impact:** Predicting the net fiscal impact (taxes paid vs. services consumed) is also difficult and has led to varied results.
    *   Early, simplistic predictions often failed to differentiate among immigrants. The reality is that the fiscal impact depends heavily on an immigrant's age, education, and skill level. High-skilled immigrants are a major fiscal positive, paying significantly more in taxes than they consume in services over their lifetimes [1].
    *   Low-skilled immigrants can represent a net fiscal cost, particularly at the state and local levels, which bear the primary cost of educating children and providing emergency healthcare, while the federal government receives most of the income and payroll taxes [1].
    *   Crucially, predictions often miss the long-term, multi-generational view. The National Academies report found that while first-generation immigrants may be a modest fiscal burden, their children (the second generation) are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population, paying more in taxes than either their parents' generation or native-born Americans of the same generation [1].

### Conclusion

In summary, economists' predictions have been accurate on the broad, macroeconomic level: immigration grows the economy, expands the labor force, and fosters entrepreneurship. However, their initial, simpler models were less accurate at predicting the specific distributional consequences, particularly regarding wages. The effect on native-born wages is not the large, negative impact some predicted, but a small, nuanced, and hotly debated effect concentrated on a specific subgroup of the population (high school dropouts). Likewise, fiscal predictions have become more accurate as they have grown more sophisticated, accounting for skill levels and multi-generational impacts. The ongoing debate highlights that the economy is not a static system, and the effects of immigration are shaped by complex, dynamic adjustments that simple models struggle to capture.

> **Author's View:** This comprehensive report, authored by a panel of leading economists and sociologists, synthesizes existing research. It concludes that immigration has a net positive effect on long-term economic growth and the fiscal health of the U.S. It finds small, and in the long-run, potentially positive wage effects for most native-born workers, but notes that there can be short-term negative effects on the wages of prior immigrants and native-born workers with similar skills (especially high school dropouts). It emphasizes that the children of immigrants are strong economic and fiscal contributors.

> **Author's View:** Michael Clemens, an economist at the Center for Global Development, argues that the economic case for immigration is overwhelmingly positive. He stresses that immigrant labor is often a complement, not a substitute, for native labor and that the economy dynamically adjusts to absorb new workers, leading to overall gains. He critiques studies that find large negative impacts as often being methodologically flawed or failing to capture the full picture.

He argues that studies like Card's miss the national picture and that when analyzed at the national level over decades, immigration is shown to lower the wages of the least-educated Americans who are in direct competition for the same jobs.

> **Author's View:** Giovanni Peri, an economist at UC Davis, summarizes the literature and presents his own research. He concludes that on average, immigration has a small but positive effect on the wages of native-born workers. He argues that this is because immigrants complement the skills of natives, push natives into higher-skilled communication-intensive jobs, and stimulate investment, offsetting the competition effect.

### Introduction

Economists have long studied and predicted the effects of immigration on host economies, focusing on areas such as wages, employment, economic growth, fiscal balances, and innovation. These predictions often stem from theoretical models (e.g., supply and demand in labor markets) and empirical studies. However, their accuracy depends on factors like the scale of immigration, the skills of immigrants, local economic conditions, and policy responses. Overall, many predictions have proven reasonably accurate, particularly those suggesting modest or positive net economic benefits, but there are notable debates and instances where predictions overestimated negative impacts or underestimated integration challenges [1]. This response examines key areas of prediction, drawing on empirical evidence from major studies and events, such as the Mariel Boatlift in the US and EU expansions.

### Predictions on Wage and Employment Impacts

A central prediction in immigration economics is that an influx of low-skilled immigrants could increase labor supply, potentially depressing wages and employment for native low-skilled workers, while benefiting higher-skilled natives and the overall economy through complementarity [2]. This is based on standard labor market models.

- **Accuracy in Specific Cases**: David Card's seminal 1990 study on the 1980 Mariel Boatlift, which saw 125,000 Cuban immigrants arrive in Miami, predicted minimal negative effects on native wages and unemployment. Retrospective analyses confirmed this accuracy; wages for low-skilled natives in Miami did not decline significantly compared to control cities, and employment effects were negligible [1]. This challenged more pessimistic predictions and has been upheld in follow-up research, though some adjustments for data issues slightly moderated the findings [3].

- **Contrasting Views and Debates**: Economist George Borjas has argued that immigration exerts downward pressure on wages for native workers without high school diplomas, predicting a 3-5% wage reduction from 1980-2000 US immigration waves [2]. However, empirical tests of these predictions have mixed results. A 2017 meta-analysis found that while short-term wage pressures exist in some localized markets, they often dissipate over time due to capital inflows and native worker adjustments, making Borjas' predictions somewhat overstated for broader economies [4]. For instance, in the UK following the 2004 EU enlargement (which allowed free movement from new member states), economists predicted wage suppression for low-skilled natives, but actual data showed limited impacts, with wages growing overall and employment rates stable [5].

In summary, predictions of severe wage depression have often been less accurate than those anticipating adaptation and minimal long-term harm, especially in dynamic economies.

### Predictions on Economic Growth and Productivity

Economists frequently predict that immigration boosts GDP growth by expanding the labor force, fostering innovation, and filling skill gaps. For example, models suggest immigrants contribute to productivity through entrepreneurship and human capital [1].

- **Empirical Accuracy**: The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's 2017 report predicted that immigration has a positive net effect on US long-run economic growth, estimating a boost of about 0.5% to GDP per immigrant over 75 years [1]. This has aligned with observed outcomes: US GDP growth from 1990-2010 was partly attributed to immigrant labor, with studies showing immigrants starting businesses at higher rates than natives [6]. In Europe, predictions for the 2004-2007 EU enlargements forecasted GDP gains of 0.2-0.3% annually for receiving countries like the UK and Germany due to labor mobility [5]. Post-event analyses confirmed these benefits, with the UK experiencing productivity gains in sectors like construction and services, though regional disparities led to some overestimations in uniform growth [4].

- **Limitations**: Predictions sometimes underestimate fiscal costs in the short term, such as increased public service demands. For instance, early models for US immigration reform in the 2010s predicted net fiscal surpluses, but actual costs for education and healthcare were higher than anticipated for low-skilled cohorts [2]. Nonetheless, long-term predictions of positive growth have generally held up.

### Predictions on Fiscal and Broader Societal Effects

Fiscal predictions often claim that skilled immigrants generate net surpluses (through taxes exceeding benefits), while low-skilled ones may impose short-term costs [1]. Accuracy here varies by welfare systems.

- **Case Studies**: In the US, predictions from the 1990s onward estimated that immigrants contribute positively to Social Security but strain local budgets [1]. This has been accurate, with immigrants overpaying into systems relative to benefits received [6]. In contrast, some European predictions, like those for Germany's 2015-2016 refugee influx, overestimated integration speeds and underestimated initial fiscal costs (e.g., welfare and training), leading to adjustments in later models [4].

Broader predictions on innovation‚Äîe.g., immigrants driving patent rates‚Äîhave been highly accurate. Economists predicted that high-skilled immigration (e.g., via H-1B visas) would enhance US innovation, and data shows immigrants account for 25% of patents despite being 13% of the population [6].

### Challenges and Overall Assessment

While many predictions have been accurate, inaccuracies arise from unforeseen factors like economic downturns (e.g., the 2008 recession amplified short-term job competition) or policy changes. Methodological debates, such as between Card's "natural experiment" approach and Borjas' national-level analyses, highlight that predictions are more accurate when context-specific [3]. A 2020 review concluded that economists' consensus on small negative wage effects for low-skilled natives and positive overall growth is supported by evidence, with about 70-80% alignment between predictions and outcomes in major studies [4].

In conclusion, economists' predictions about immigration have been largely accurate in predicting net positive economic effects and minimal long-term harm, though short-term and localized impacts are sometimes underestimated. Ongoing research continues to refine these models for better precision.
