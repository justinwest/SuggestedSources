Economists' predictions about the economic effects of immigration have been a subject of intense debate, with analyses suggesting they were accurate in some respects but significantly flawed in others, particularly concerning wage impacts on low-skilled workers and the pace of immigrant assimilation.

### Areas of Inaccurate or Contested Predictions

A major point of contention is the predicted impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers. For decades, a broad consensus among economists held that the negative wage effects of immigration were minimal or nonexistent [2, 3]. This view was based on studies showing that local economies could absorb new arrivals without significant disruption to the local labor market [3, 4]. For instance, the UK’s Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) and the Bank of England consistently promoted the view that large-scale immigration from new EU member states after 2004 had little to no adverse effect on the wages of Britain's lowest-paid workers [2].

However, critics argue this consensus was a significant failure.
*   **Underestimation of Wage Impacts:** Economist George Borjas argues that basic supply-and-demand theory predicts an influx of low-skilled labor will lower the wages of competing low-skilled native workers. He contends that many studies missed this effect by focusing on local labor markets, where native workers might move away in response to immigration, thus spreading the wage impact across the entire country. His national-level analyses suggest that for every 10% increase in the supply of labor from a specific skill group, the wages for that group fall by 3-4% [1]. Similarly, J.R. Shackleton points to evidence that the wave of Eastern European immigration did, in fact, exert downward pressure on the wages of the UK's least-skilled workers, a reality that the economic establishment downplayed, contributing to public discontent that fueled Brexit [2].
*   **Overly Optimistic Assimilation Rates:** Economists traditionally predicted that immigrants would experience rapid economic assimilation, with their wages catching up to those of native-born workers over a generation. Borjas's research challenges this, showing that while this was true for immigrant waves in the mid-20th century, more recent cohorts since the 1980s have started with a much larger initial wage gap and are assimilating far more slowly. This slower convergence means that the economic gap between recent immigrants and natives may persist for multiple generations [1].

### Areas of More Accurate Predictions

While criticized for their wage predictions, economists were more accurate in other areas, though these predictions often came with important caveats that were not well-communicated.

*   **Overall Economic Gains (The "Immigration Surplus"):** Most economic models correctly predicted that immigration generates a net economic gain for the native-born population, known as the "immigration surplus." This surplus arises because immigration increases the supply of labor, allowing companies to expand production and lower prices. This benefits owners of capital (e.g., business owners) and consumers [1, 3]. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) affirmed in a major 2017 report that immigration has an overall positive impact on long-run economic growth in the U.S. [3].
*   **Distributional Consequences:** The central caveat to the "immigration surplus"—one that Borjas and other critics argue was often ignored—is that the gains are not distributed evenly. The surplus itself is generated precisely *because* the wages of competing native workers are suppressed. Therefore, while the native population as a whole benefits, some groups (low-skilled workers) lose, while others (capital owners and high-skilled workers who use immigrant services) win [1]. The failure was not in predicting the surplus, but in failing to adequately predict and communicate these significant distributional consequences, leading the public to believe that immigration was a win for everyone [2].
*   **Fiscal Impacts:** Economists' predictions about the fiscal impact of immigrants (taxes paid vs. services consumed) have been nuanced and generally borne out by evidence. Studies show that outcomes vary significantly by skill level. High-skilled immigrants tend to be strong net fiscal contributors, paying more in taxes than they consume in public benefits over their lifetimes. Conversely, low-skilled immigrants are often net fiscal drains, particularly at state and local levels where education and healthcare costs are concentrated [1, 3].

In summary, economists accurately predicted that immigration would produce a net economic benefit for the destination country. However, their predictions are widely criticized for underestimating the negative impact on low-skilled native workers' wages, being overly optimistic about the pace of assimilation for recent immigrant cohorts, and failing to effectively communicate that the overall gains came with significant distributional losses for specific segments of the population [1, 2, 3].

He contends that much of the economics profession has downplayed or missed these effects and has been overly optimistic about the speed of modern immigrants' economic assimilation.
