Based on the provided sources, economists' predictions about immigration have often been inaccurate or incomplete, tending towards over-optimism by focusing on aggregate benefits while downplaying significant negative impacts on specific segments of the population and public finances [2, 1]. The predictions were frequently flawed because they relied on broad averages that masked crucial details about wage competition, fiscal costs, and the composition of immigrant groups [1, 3].

Key areas where predictions fell short include:

**1. Impact on Wages for Low-Skilled Workers**
Many mainstream economic predictions suggested that immigration had little to no negative effect on the wages of native-born workers [2]. However, this consensus has been challenged as being inaccurate, particularly for the lowest-paid workers.

*   **Theoretical Prediction vs. Empirical Findings:** Economist George J. Borjas argues that basic supply-and-demand models correctly predict that a large influx of low-skilled immigrant labor will lower the wages of competing low-skilled native workers. He contends that the failure was not in the economic theory itself, but in many empirical studies that, due to methodological choices like analyzing large geographic areas, diluted and failed to detect this downward wage pressure. In his view, the debate should be about the *magnitude* of the wage loss for this group, not its existence [1].
*   **Real-World Evidence:** In the UK, critics like Matthew Goodwin point out that while economists promised minimal wage impact, organizations like the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee later acknowledged that record-breaking immigration had put downward pressure on the wages of lower-paid workers [2]. Research for the Bank of England confirmed that while the overall wage effect was small, there was a negative impact on wages in the semi-skilled and unskilled service sectors [4].

**2. Fiscal Impact and Public Services**
Predictions often claimed that immigration provided a net fiscal benefit, with immigrants contributing more in taxes than they consumed in services. This has proven to be an oversimplification that is highly dependent on the immigrants' country of origin and skill level [2, 3].

*   **The Flaw of Averages:** A Danish government study, summarized by Emil Kirkegaard, provides a detailed breakdown of the fiscal impact of immigrants by their country of origin. It found that the fiscal effect varies dramatically. Immigrants from Western countries and their descendants provided a significant net fiscal contribution. In stark contrast, immigrants from MENAPT countries (Middle East, North Africa, Pakistan, and Turkey) and their descendants represented a major net fiscal cost [3]. This demonstrates that broad, optimistic predictions based on an "average" immigrant are misleading. The overall fiscal outcome depends entirely on the *composition* of the immigrant population, a detail many predictions ignored [3].
*   **Strain on Public Services:** Economists were also criticized for failing to predict or account for the immense strain that a rapid, large-scale increase in population places on public services like healthcare, schools, and housing. These "second-order" effects were often absent from models that focused narrowly on labor markets and aggregate GDP [2].

**3. The Disconnect Between Aggregate Growth and Individual Prosperity**
A central failure in many economic predictions was the focus on aggregate GDP growth while ignoring GDP per capita. While immigration can increase the overall size of an economy, this does not necessarily make the average citizen better off. Goodwin notes that for much of the 2000s in the UK, strong headline GDP growth coincided with stagnant or falling GDP per capita, meaning the economic pie was bigger, but individual slices were smaller [2]. Economists were criticized for presenting the aggregate figure as an unqualified success without explaining these distributional consequences [2, 1].

In conclusion, the predictions of many economists regarding immigration were inaccurate primarily because they were based on incomplete models. They often downplayed the theoretically predictable negative wage effects on the low-skilled, used misleading averages that concealed vast differences in fiscal impacts between immigrant groups, and failed to account for the pressures that the scale of migration placed on public services and per-capita prosperity [1, 2, 3].

    *   Borjas argues that standard economic supply-and-demand models correctly predict that immigration of low-skilled workers will lower the wages of competing native-born workers. He critiques empirical studies that find no effect, suggesting they are methodologically flawed, and asserts that the economic debate should be about the *magnitude* of this effect, not its existence.

    *   Goodwin contends that the "mainstream economic consensus" in the UK on immigration was "spectacularly wrong." He argues economists were overly optimistic, downplayed negative wage impacts on the poor, ignored the strain on public services, and failed to account for the negative effects of the sheer scale of population growth on per-capita GDP.

    *   Kirkegaard, summarizing a detailed Danish government report, shows that the fiscal impact of immigrants is not uniform. It varies dramatically by country of origin, with immigrants from Western countries providing a net fiscal benefit and those from MENAPT (Middle East, North Africa, Pakistan, and Turkey) countries representing a significant net fiscal cost. This highlights the failure of predictions based on simple averages.

    *   This article summarizes a 2015 Bank of England report. It states that while the *overall* wage impact of immigration is minimal, the research found evidence of a small negative impact on wages in the semi-skilled and unskilled service sectors. This supports the view that broad predictions missed the specific, negative effects on lower-paid workers.
