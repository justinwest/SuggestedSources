Based on the provided sources, economists' predictions about immigration have been criticized as inaccurate, particularly for being overly optimistic and for downplaying negative consequences for specific segments of the population [1, 2]. The critiques focus on three main areas: wage impacts, fiscal effects, and the overall narrative presented to the public.

### 1. Inaccurate Predictions on Wage Impacts
A central prediction of standard economic theory is that immigration, by increasing the supply of labor, will lower the wages of native-born workers who compete for the same jobs. At the same time, it benefits business owners (capital) and consumers through lower prices. The net effect is a small overall economic gain for the native population, known as the "immigration surplus" [1].

However, critics argue that many economists and institutions downplayed or ignored the negative wage effects on low-skilled native workers.
*   **Downplaying Redistribution:** Labor economist George Borjas argues that while the immigration surplus is small (estimating it at a mere 0.24% of GDP for the US in 2015), the redistribution of wealth is massive. He calculates that in the US, immigration has redistributed hundreds of billions of dollars annually from low-skilled native workers (in the form of lower wages) to employers (in the form of higher profits) [1]. Critics contend that by focusing only on the small net gain, economists presented a misleadingly positive picture and failed to predict the significant negative impact on the most vulnerable native workers [1, 2].
*   **Contradictory Evidence:** In the UK, institutions like the Bank of England initially published models suggesting that mass immigration had little to no effect on the wages of low-skilled workers. However, later analysis from the Bank itself found a negative correlation, with a 10 percentage point rise in the proportion of immigrants being associated with a nearly 2% reduction in the pay of semi/unskilled service workers [2]. Ed West, in *The Failure Of Economists*, argues that the economics profession consistently produced optimistic forecasts that were later proven wrong, contributing to a decline in public trust [2].

### 2. Overly Generalized Predictions on Fiscal Impact
Economists often predicted that immigration would provide a net fiscal benefit, as young immigrant workers would pay taxes that support aging native populations. The provided sources argue this prediction was inaccurate because it failed to account for crucial variables, especially the skill level and country of origin of the immigrants [1, 3].
*   **Variation by Origin:** Data from Denmark, analyzed by Emil Kirkegaard, shows a vast disparity in the fiscal impact of immigrants based on their country of origin. Immigrants from Western countries and certain East Asian nations tend to be significant net fiscal contributors. In contrast, immigrants from many countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia represent a substantial net fiscal cost, consuming far more in welfare, education, and other public services than they pay in taxes [3]. Therefore, a blanket prediction that "immigration is a fiscal positive" is inaccurate, as the outcome depends entirely on the composition of the immigrant flow [3].
*   **Impact of Low-Skilled Immigration:** Borjas makes a similar point, noting that low-skill immigrant households in the US have historically been a net fiscal burden. These households tend to have lower incomes, pay less in taxes, and have higher rates of participation in means-tested welfare programs and public services, creating a fiscal drain, particularly at the state and local levels [1].

### 3. Reasons for Inaccurate Predictions
The sources suggest several reasons why economists' predictions were flawed or misleading.
*   **Political Bias and Groupthink:** Ed West argues that a pro-immigration "Blob" of political, academic, and media elites created an environment where dissenting or negative findings about immigration were dismissed. He contends that economists were part of a consensus that favored mass immigration and were reluctant to challenge that narrative, leading them to produce and promote overly optimistic studies [2].
*   **Methodological Choices:** Borjas suggests that some economists intentionally used models and assumptions that would minimize the negative wage impacts of immigration. He argues that by focusing on national-level data and ignoring the specific effects on local labor markets where immigrants cluster, researchers could obscure the true consequences for competing native workers [1].
*   **Focus on the Wrong Metric:** By emphasizing the small, abstract "immigration surplus," economists ignored the far more tangible and politically significant issue of wealth redistribution from the poor to the rich. This created a perception that immigration was a win-win, when in fact it produced clear winners and losers [1].

In conclusion, the provided sources argue that economists' predictions about immigration were often inaccurate. They failed to adequately forecast the negative wage pressure on low-skilled workers, presented overly optimistic and generalized fiscal predictions that ignored key differences among immigrant groups, and contributed to a public narrative that glossed over the significant distributional consequences of immigration policies [1, 2, 3].

1.  **Wewantedworkers Chapter9**: George Borjas, a labor economist, argues that standard economic models do predict that immigration lowers wages for competing native workers and creates a large redistribution of wealth from labor to capital. He contends that many economists have downplayed or ignored these consequences, focusing instead on a very small "immigration surplus," thereby presenting an incomplete and overly optimistic picture.

2.  **The Failure Of Economists**: Ed West critiques the economics profession, particularly in the UK, for what he describes as a systemic failure to accurately predict the effects of mass immigration. He argues that economists were consistently over-optimistic, ignored negative wage impacts on the poor, and were influenced by a political pro-immigration consensus, leading to flawed analysis and a loss of public trust.

3.  **Fiscal Impact Of Immigrants By Country Of Origin**: Emil Kirkegaard presents data showing that the fiscal impact of immigrants is not uniform but varies dramatically by country of origin. His analysis of Danish data indicates that while some immigrant groups (e.g., from Western countries) are net fiscal contributors, many others are significant net fiscal costs. This challenges generalized predictions that immigration is inherently a net benefit for public finances.
