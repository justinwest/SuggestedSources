Economists' predictions about the economic impact of immigration have been accurate in some respects but highly contentious and less accurate in others, particularly concerning the magnitude of wage effects. The accuracy of a prediction often depends on the specific economic model used, the time frame considered, and which segment of the population is being examined [1, 3].

### The Standard Model and its Predictions
The standard "textbook" economic model of immigration, as described by economist George Borjas, makes several key predictions:
*   **A Small Net Economic Gain:** The model predicts that native-born citizens, as a whole, receive a net economic benefit from immigration, known as the "immigration surplus." This surplus is generated because immigration increases the supply of labor, which lowers wages for competing workers but increases returns for business owners and other capital holders. The gains to the capital owners are predicted to be slightly larger than the losses to the workers, resulting in a small net positive for the native population [1].
*   **Significant Redistribution of Wealth:** A crucial prediction of this model is that the distributional effects are much larger than the net gain. Wealth is effectively transferred from native workers who compete with immigrant labor (in the form of lower wages) to native employers and capital owners (in the form of higher profits). Borjas estimates this redistribution can be substantial, while the net surplus itself is a very small fraction of GDP, often less than 0.5% [1].

### Accuracy of the Predictions

1.  **Net Economic Gain (The Immigration Surplus):** The prediction that the overall net economic gain to the native population is small has largely been borne out by empirical evidence. Most studies find that the impact of immigration on the overall gross domestic product (GDP) is positive but modest, consistent with the small "immigration surplus" predicted by the models [1, 3]. However, Borjas argues that economists have often been misleading in their public communications by focusing on this small net gain while downplaying the more significant distributional consequences [1].

2.  **Wage and Employment Impacts (The Distributional Effects):** This is the most debated area. The accuracy of predictions about wage impacts depends heavily on which group of workers is studied and the methodology used.
    *   **The Critical View:** George Borjas argues that the model's prediction of wage depression for competing workers is accurate. His research suggests that immigration has significantly lowered the wages of native-born workers who did not complete high school—a group that directly competes with many low-skilled immigrants. He criticizes other economists for failing to find this effect, suggesting their methods are flawed [1].
    *   **The Minimal Impact View:** Other prominent economists, like David Card, have found very different results. Card's famous study of the 1980 Mariel boatlift, which brought a sudden influx of low-skilled Cuban workers to Miami, found no significant negative wage or employment effects on Miami's existing low-skilled workers [2]. This result directly challenges the simple textbook model's prediction. Research summarized by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) highlights Card's findings that native-born workers and immigrants are not perfect substitutes, and that local economies can adjust to labor influxes more smoothly than the simple model predicts [2].
    *   **The Consensus View:** A landmark 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) synthesized hundreds of studies to form a consensus view. It concluded that over a period of 10 years or more, the impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers is "very small." The report did find, however, that some groups—specifically prior immigrants and native-born high school dropouts—can experience negative short-run wage impacts. Overall, the NASEM report suggests that the negative wage effects predicted by the simplest models are often overstated or are limited to specific, smaller segments of the population in the short term [3].

3.  **Fiscal Impacts:** Predictions about the fiscal impact of immigration (taxes paid versus social services consumed) are also complex. The NASEM report found that the impact varies by generation.
    *   First-generation immigrants are, on average, more costly to governments than the native-born population, especially at the state and local levels [3].
    *   However, the children of immigrants (the second generation) are "among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the U.S. population," contributing more in taxes than their parents or other native-born Americans [3].
    Therefore, predictions focusing only on first-generation immigrants can be misleadingly pessimistic, while predictions that account for their children are much more positive.

In conclusion, economists' basic models were broadly accurate in predicting the *structure* of immigration's economic effects: a small overall net benefit combined with larger distributional shifts. However, the real-world *magnitude* of these effects, particularly the negative impact on native wages, remains a subject of intense debate. While some research aligns with the prediction of significant wage depression for low-skilled natives [1], a broader consensus suggests these effects are minimal for most natives in the long run [2, 3].

    *   **Author's View:** Borjas argues that standard economic models correctly predict that immigration creates a small net economic gain for natives but causes a much larger redistribution of wealth, with native workers who compete with immigrants seeing their wages fall. He criticizes other economists for downplaying these negative wage effects and focusing only on the small net benefit.

It concludes that the long-term impact of immigration on the wages and employment of native-born workers is very small. While some groups (like prior immigrants or native-born high school dropouts) may experience short-run negative impacts, the overall effect is minimal. The report also finds that while first-generation immigrants may be a net fiscal cost, their children (the second generation) are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.
