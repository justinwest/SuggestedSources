## Economists’ Predictions on Immigration and Outcomes

Economists have generally predicted that immigration would have **minimal adverse impact** on native workers’ wages and employment while providing overall economic benefits. This prediction is rooted in economic theory: new immigrants increase labor supply, but they also consume goods and services, creating new demand that offsets the added labor competition ([www.irishtimes.com](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/12/11/economists-need-to-get-their-story-straight-on-immigration/#:~:text=number%20of%20empirical%20studies%20which,the%20wages%20of%20native%20workers)) . Over decades, numerous empirical studies have confirmed that **the average effect of immigration on native-born workers’ wages is very small to near-zero**, consistent with economists’ expectations ([www.irishtimes.com](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/12/11/economists-need-to-get-their-story-straight-on-immigration/#:~:text=number%20of%20empirical%20studies%20which,the%20wages%20of%20native%20workers)) . For example, a comprehensive review by the U.S. National Academies concluded that immigration’s long-term impact on natives’ wages and employment was *“very small”* overall . In some cases, researchers even find slight **positive wage effects** for certain native groups, as immigrants can complement native skills and boost productivity (for instance, by filling labor shortages or inspiring innovation) . 

## Evidence of Accuracy and Small Wage Effects

**Real-world evidence largely supports economists’ predictions.** Thirty years of data across industrialized countries show little proof that immigrants significantly depress native wages ([www.irishtimes.com](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/12/11/economists-need-to-get-their-story-straight-on-immigration/#:~:text=number%20of%20empirical%20studies%20which,the%20wages%20of%20native%20workers)). Most studies find **no negative impact on average wages**, and only modest distributional effects between skill groups. Natives’ wages tend to be **“insulated”** by market adjustments – businesses invest in new technologies, expand production, or natives shift to jobs that leverage their language and local skills, mitigating wage competition ([www.irishtimes.com](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/12/11/economists-need-to-get-their-story-straight-on-immigration/#:~:text=Yet%20many%20economists%20are%20now,they%20notice%20the%20apparent%20intellectual)) . For instance, a 2014 survey of research concluded that immigration has *“a very small effect on the average wages of native workers”* and **“little evidence”** of wage declines even for less-educated natives ([www.irishtimes.com](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/12/11/economists-need-to-get-their-story-straight-on-immigration/#:~:text=number%20of%20empirical%20studies%20which,the%20wages%20of%20native%20workers)) . Likewise, the National Academies report found any negative wage impacts are most likely confined to specific subsets like recent immigrants themselves or native high-school dropouts, while **most native workers experience no wage loss** from immigration . These findings indicate that economists’ optimistic predictions (i.e. that wage effects would be negligible on average) have been **largely accurate**.

## Distributional Nuances and Divergent Findings

That said, economists have noted **distributional nuances** in immigration’s impact, and here their predictions have been partly confirmed with some debate. For example, some economists (notably George Borjas) predicted that an influx of lower-skilled immigrants could slightly reduce wages for the least-skilled native workers who compete directly with them. In line with that, a national-level analysis found that a 10% increase in the labor force of a given skill group might lower wages for that group by roughly 3–4% . In the U.S. from 1980–2000, immigration was estimated to have **cut wages of native workers without a high-school diploma by about 5% in the long run**, even as it had virtually no effect on average wages for natives overall once the economy adjusted . These outcomes suggest that economists who cautioned about modest downsides for the least-skilled were **partly correct** – small wage dips have occurred for certain groups. However, even those measured effects (a few percentage points) are **far smaller** than popular fears of widespread wage depression. Other economists predicted even those impacts would be minimal or temporary, and many studies indeed find *no significant drop* in low-end wages or attribute the slight wage declines mostly to earlier immigrants rather than native-born workers ([www.irishtimes.com](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/12/11/economists-need-to-get-their-story-straight-on-immigration/#:~:text=For%20years%2C%20mainstream%20economists%20have,the%20wages%20of%20native%20workers)) . In the UK, for instance, research found immigration **slightly depressed wages at the bottom of the wage distribution but slightly raised wages at the top**, yielding a *“slightly positive”* overall effect on average pay ([www.irishtimes.com](https://www.irishtimes.com/world/uk/2024/08/07/conservative-rhetoric-on-migrants-helped-prepare-ground-for-far-right-riots-say-critics/#:~:text=gripping%20the%20UK%2C%20critics%20including,senior%20politicians%20have%20warned)) . This pattern aligns with the idea that new immigrants often **complement** higher-skill natives (raising productivity for those workers) while creating mild competition for similar low-skill workers.

## Overall Economic Benefits vs Public Perceptions

Beyond wages, economists predicted that immigration would be a **net positive for economic growth and fiscal health**, and evidence supports this. Immigrants fill labor gaps, drive innovation, and often start businesses, which can increase overall productivity and GDP. Studies show immigration contributes to long-run economic growth and has neutral or positive fiscal effects over generations (with the second generation of immigrants often among the strongest net contributors to public finances) . These outcomes validate economists’ forecasts that immigration would not wreck public finances or job markets. In fact, recent analyses suggest immigration has **boosted employment rates and had small positive wage effects** for many native workers by enlarging the economy’s capacity  . Crucially, as one analyst noted, there is an *“utter lack”* of credible studies showing any large negative impact of immigration on overall native wages . This consensus among economists – that immigration’s benefits broadly outweigh its costs – has proven **remarkably accurate** in practice, even if it contrasts with public fears.

However, public perception often lags behind these findings, partly because the **nuances can be lost**. Economists emphasize average and long-run effects, whereas individual workers or communities may still **feel short-term pressures**. For years, economists reassured the public that immigrants were not “stealing jobs” or dragging down most people’s wages, given the tiny measured impact. Yet, as journalist Sarah O’Connor observes, the messaging can seem contradictory at times ([www.irishtimes.com](https://www.irishtimes.com/world/uk/2024/08/07/conservative-rhetoric-on-migrants-helped-prepare-ground-for-far-right-riots-say-critics/#:~:text=gripping%20the%20UK%2C%20critics%20including,senior%20politicians%20have%20warned)) . She notes that economists who say *immigration barely affects wages* have also warned that suddenly removing large numbers of immigrants (for example, via stringent deportation or Brexit-style restrictions) would cause labor shortages and drive up wages and prices . This isn’t actually inconsistent – it reflects the difference between gradual, balanced immigration (which gently holds down wage growth **just a little** while expanding the economy) versus a sudden labor supply shock. Nonetheless, the nuance can be confusing. Economists’ core prediction was that **immigration keeps overall wage growth in check but only very modestly**, which is compatible with the idea that an abrupt reversal (cutting the labor supply) would boost wages and inflation in the short run. In retrospect, economists’ predictions about immigration have been **largely on target**: far from wrecking host economies, immigration has had broadly positive effects with only limited, specific downsides. The challenge has been communicating this clearly, so that the public recognizes that the **small wage impacts and big economic gains** economists forecast were indeed what happened. 

## Conclusion

In summary, economists’ predictions about immigration’s effects have proven to be **mostly accurate**. Immigration did **not cause mass unemployment or widespread wage collapse**; on the contrary, the overall impact on native wages has been essentially neutral or slightly positive, as many economists anticipated [1][2][4]. Where there have been negative pressures – primarily on low-skilled wages – they have been **relatively minor (a few percent)** and often offset by broader gains (higher productivity, lower prices, and improved job specialization), just as economic theory suggested. Moreover, the **benefits** economists predicted (higher growth, innovation, and long-term fiscal contributions) are supported by the evidence [2][4]. While debate continues on specific nuances, the weight of research indicates that the economic forecasts made by most economists regarding immigration were **largely correct**. In short, immigration has delivered modestly positive economic outcomes overall, vindicating the predictions that economists made, albeit with the understanding that not *everyone* benefits equally in the short run. Their credibility on this topic, therefore, rests on a solid track record of predictions aligning with observed reality – even if conveying the full story to the public remains an ongoing challenge.

3. **Sarah O’Connor (2024)** – *Financial Times columnist writing in The Irish Times.* Highlights a seeming **contradiction in economists’ messaging** on immigration. She notes economists long argued that immigrants **don’t undercut native wages** (because added labor supply is offset by added demand, yielding **negligible wage effects**), citing many studies that found only **small if any wage impacts** ([www.irishtimes.com](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/12/11/economists-need-to-get-their-story-straight-on-immigration/#:~:text=For%20years%2C%20mainstream%20economists%20have,the%20wages%20of%20native%20workers)). Yet the **same economists warn** that mass deportation or cutting off immigration would cause labor shortages and drive wages *up*, implicitly admitting immigrants had been holding wages **slightly down** ([www.irishtimes.com](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/12/11/economists-need-to-get-their-story-straight-on-immigration/#:~:text=Yet%20many%20economists%20are%20now,mistrust%20or%20simply%20ignore%20what)).

The study found **immigration boosted wages by roughly 2% for less-educated U.S. natives and had no significant effect on college-educated natives**, with **no evidence of job “crowding out”** ([marginalrevolution.com](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/04/updated-estimates-on-immigration-and-wages.html#:~:text=Using%20these%20estimates%2C%20we%20calculate,crowding%20out%20effects%20on%20employment)). Even in 2019–2022, simulations showed **small positive wage effects for non-college workers** and no negative employment impact ([marginalrevolution.com](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/04/updated-estimates-on-immigration-and-wages.html#:~:text=significant%20effect%20between%20%2B1,crowding%20out%20effects%20on%20employment)). Cowen notes his takeaway is the **“utter lack of…real wage estimates that show immigration to be a major negative”** for U.S. natives ([marginalrevolution.com](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/04/updated-estimates-on-immigration-and-wages.html#:~:text=That%20is%20froma%20new%20NBER,native%20workers)), highlighting that virtually no credible study finds large harms. *Source:* *Marginal Revolution* – “Updated estimates on immigration and wages.”

5. **George J. Borjas (2006)** – *Harvard economist known for a skeptical view on immigration’s wage impact.* Borjas argues that standard economic theory predicts increased labor supply will **lower wages** for competing workers. He contends earlier local-case studies missed this effect due to mobility and adjustment. His national-level analysis for 1980–2000 suggests immigration **reduced average native wages by ~3% and wages of high-school dropouts by ~8% in the short run** (about **–5% for dropouts in the long run after capital adjusts) ([scholar.harvard.edu](https://scholar.harvard.edu/gborjas/_publications/for-a-few-dollars-less#:~:text=My%20Harvard%20colleague%20Lawrence%20Katz,for%20high%20school%20dropouts)) ([scholar.harvard.edu](https://scholar.harvard.edu/gborjas/_publications/for-a-few-dollars-less#:~:text=The%20,dropouts%20still%20fell%20by%205)). This implies modest but non-trivial losses for the least-skilled native workers. Borjas’s view illustrates that some economists predicted **small negative wage effects for low-skill natives**, a prediction partly borne out in the data, though his magnitude is on the higher end of estimates. *Source:* *Washington Post (op-ed)* – “For a Few Dollars Less,” summarizing Borjas’s research findings.
