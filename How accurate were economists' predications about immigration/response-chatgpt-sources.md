Economists have a long history of making optimistic predictions about the effects of immigration – predictions which have often proved **inaccurate or incomplete**. Many economists traditionally argued that immigration would boost overall economic growth with minimal downside, sometimes even likening open immigration to “free trade” in labor. For example, prior to major policy changes, experts confidently predicted only modest immigration flows and negligible impacts on society. In 1965, U.S. officials (echoing the prevailing economic wisdom) assured that reforming immigration law would not lead to a large influx of new immigrants ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/839171608/George-J-Borjas-We-Wanted-Workers-1#:~:text=It%20is%20prudent%20to%20be,figures%20from%20Western%20Hemisphere%20countries)) ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/839171608/George-J-Borjas-We-Wanted-Workers-1#:~:text=These%20forecasts%20could%20not%20have,immigrants%2C%20with%20corresponding%20changes%20in)). **In reality, those forecasts “could not have been more wrong.”** Immigration surged far beyond expectations, fundamentally changing the number and origins of newcomers and bringing much larger economic and social effects than predicted ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/839171608/George-J-Borjas-We-Wanted-Workers-1#:~:text=These%20forecasts%20could%20not%20have,immigrants%2C%20with%20corresponding%20changes%20in)). This pattern – **economists underestimating immigration’s scale and impact** – has recurred in other instances (such as Europe’s experience in the 2000s), undermining confidence in expert forecasts.

**Labor market outcomes** illustrate economists’ predictive errors.  Many economists had predicted that adding immigrant workers would not hurt native employment or wages in any serious way. Some even claimed *“immigrants do jobs natives won’t”* without depressing pay. But evidence shows the benefits have been very **unevenly distributed**, contrary to those predictions. In practice, most of the economic gains from immigration accrue to the immigrants themselves (who earn higher wages than in their home countries) and to businesses or other capital owners (who enjoy access to a bigger labor pool and lower labor costs) ([www.notonyourteam.co.uk](https://www.notonyourteam.co.uk/p/the-failure-of-economists#:~:text=The%20overwhelming%20majority%20of%20the,social%20capital%20of%20the%20professional)). **Native-born workers – especially those with lower skills – often see little benefit, and may even experience wage declines due to competition** ([www.notonyourteam.co.uk](https://www.notonyourteam.co.uk/p/the-failure-of-economists#:~:text=The%20overwhelming%20majority%20of%20the,social%20capital%20of%20the%20professional)). In other words, the “rising tide” of immigration has *not* lifted all boats equally. For example, an influx of **lower-paid migrant labor can put downward pressure on earnings** for similar native workers – a consequence that many economists’ models downplayed. These distributional outcomes left economists’ rosy predictions of “no harm” to native workers looking **overly optimistic**. As one analysis put it, immigration’s gains have been captured largely by migrants and their employers, so it takes only a small adverse effect for local workers to end up worse off on balance ([www.notonyourteam.co.uk](https://www.notonyourteam.co.uk/p/the-failure-of-economists#:~:text=The%20overwhelming%20majority%20of%20the,social%20capital%20of%20the%20professional)). This mismatch between prediction and reality has contributed to a public perception that economists “got immigration seriously wrong,” particularly regarding its **impact on the working class** ([www.notonyourteam.co.uk](https://www.notonyourteam.co.uk/p/the-failure-of-economists#:~:text=public%20mind%20with%20open%20borders,a%20friend%20notes%20about%20free)).

**Fiscal and economic projections** by economists have likewise often missed the mark.  Analysts commonly asserted that immigrants would be net contributors to public finances – helping support aging populations by paying taxes and enlarging the economy. While high-skilled immigrants *do* tend to contribute positively, the **overall fiscal picture turned out far more complex** than early predictions assumed. Research reveals that many immigrant groups (especially those with lower education or from poorer regions) **consume more in public services and benefits than they pay in taxes**, resulting in net fiscal costs for host countries ([emilkirkegaard.dk](https://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/2024/02/fiscal-impact-of-immigrants-by-country-of-origin/#:~:text=,thinking%20of%20the%20long%20term)). For instance, a comprehensive **European Commission study found that immigrants from outside the EU were, on average, a net drain on public finances**, largely due to immigrants from certain regions (e.g. the Middle East) having low employment and high welfare use ([www.lorenzofromoz.net](https://www.lorenzofromoz.net/p/taking-in-palestinian-refugees-is#:~:text=A%202020%20European%20Commission%20report,This%20is%20not%20surprising)).  Detailed national data reinforce this point: in Denmark and the Netherlands, **most non-Western immigrants (particularly those from Muslim-majority countries) impose a net lifetime fiscal burden, whereas Western and skilled immigrants tend to be net contributors** ([emilkirkegaard.dk](https://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/2024/02/fiscal-impact-of-immigrants-by-country-of-origin/#:~:text=age%20distribution,scenario%20of%20immigrants%20from%20the)) ([emilkirkegaard.dk](https://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/2024/02/fiscal-impact-of-immigrants-by-country-of-origin/#:~:text=,thinking%20of%20the%20long%20term)). These outcomes directly contradict the blanket prediction that “immigration pays for itself.” In the United States, too, the long-run fiscal impact of immigration has been *mixed*. According to National Academy of Sciences estimates summarized by economist George Borjas, **highly-educated immigrants eventually produce a small net fiscal gain, but immigrants without a high school diploma create a substantial net cost** to taxpayers ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/839171608/George-J-Borjas-We-Wanted-Workers-1#:~:text=The%20panel%20also%20estimated%20the,generates%20a%20fiscal%20loss%2C%20and)). In fact, when short-term costs (e.g. schooling, welfare) are weighed against immigrants’ tax contributions, the **net economic benefit to the native-born population shrinks dramatically**. Borjas notes that under cautious assumptions, *immigration’s net boost to natives’ income is roughly zero* – essentially a wash ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/839171608/George-J-Borjas-We-Wanted-Workers-1#:~:text=If%20we%20take%20the%20most,%E2%80%9Ceconomic%20pie%E2%80%9D%20accruing%20to%20natives)). This finding stands in stark contrast to the **significant gains** that economists’ models had predicted from increased immigration.

Underpinning these predictive failures is a tendency of traditional economic models to **oversimplify human and social factors**. Economists often treated workers as interchangeable units, assuming immigrants would integrate smoothly and have similar outcomes as natives with equivalent skills. In reality, differences in language, education quality, culture, and institutions mean that immigrant groups perform very differently – something early predictions did not account for ([www.notonyourteam.co.uk](https://www.notonyourteam.co.uk/p/the-failure-of-economists#:~:text=,Emphasis%20added)) ([www.notonyourteam.co.uk](https://www.notonyourteam.co.uk/p/the-failure-of-economists#:~:text=The%20overwhelming%20majority%20of%20the,social%20capital%20of%20the%20professional)). **Cultural and institutional factors** can affect how well immigrants succeed and how they impact society, but such factors were largely absent from the economic forecasts. As a result, economists were surprised by outcomes like **slow assimilation, concentrated immigrant poverty, or strain on welfare systems**, which their models hadn’t anticipated. Critics argue that many economists became blinded by elegant theories (focused on efficiency and aggregate gains) and **ignored “resilience” – the capacity of communities to absorb change without harm** ([www.notonyourteam.co.uk](https://www.notonyourteam.co.uk/p/the-failure-of-economists#:~:text=the%20immigration%20that%20folk%20were,the%20evolved%20structure%20of%20human)). By prioritizing theoretical gains, they overlooked real-world costs (and public concerns) related to social cohesion and local well-being.

In summary, **economists’ predictions about immigration have often proven overly optimistic and inaccurate**. They underestimated the scale of immigration flows and **overstated the broad-based economic gains**, while downplaying distributional downsides and fiscal costs. Immigration has indeed brought benefits – including entrepreneurship, innovation, and for some countries a younger workforce – but **not to the extent or the universality that many economists foretold**. Instead of a win-win rising tide, the actual outcome has been a mixed bag: modest overall GDP growth, **significant gains for immigrants and employers, but smaller or even negative effects for less-skilled natives and public coffers** ([www.notonyourteam.co.uk](https://www.notonyourteam.co.uk/p/the-failure-of-economists#:~:text=The%20overwhelming%20majority%20of%20the,social%20capital%20of%20the%20professional)) ([emilkirkegaard.dk](https://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/2024/02/fiscal-impact-of-immigrants-by-country-of-origin/#:~:text=,thinking%20of%20the%20long%20term)). The **poor accuracy of these predictions** has not gone unnoticed. Commentators from across the spectrum now acknowledge that the economic establishment “got [immigration] seriously wrong,” calling this misjudgment a grave professional failure ([www.notonyourteam.co.uk](https://www.notonyourteam.co.uk/p/the-failure-of-economists#:~:text=public%20mind%20with%20open%20borders,a%20friend%20notes%20about%20free)) ([www.notonyourteam.co.uk](https://www.notonyourteam.co.uk/p/the-failure-of-economists#:~:text=The%20failure%20of%20economists)). In light of the evidence, today’s analyses are more nuanced, recognizing that immigration’s impact **depends on who comes, their skills, and how society adapts**. In retrospect, the sweeping promises made by economists about immigration proved **no match for the complex reality**, leaving many of their predictions unfulfilled and prompting a re-examination of how we assess immigration’s true economic effects ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/839171608/George-J-Borjas-We-Wanted-Workers-1#:~:text=These%20forecasts%20could%20not%20have,immigrants%2C%20with%20corresponding%20changes%20in)) ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/839171608/George-J-Borjas-We-Wanted-Workers-1#:~:text=If%20we%20take%20the%20most,%E2%80%9Ceconomic%20pie%E2%80%9D%20accruing%20to%20natives)).
