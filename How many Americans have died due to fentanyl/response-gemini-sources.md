# How many Americans have died due to fentanyl?

Based on the provided sources, the number of Americans who have died from fentanyl has risen dramatically over the last decade.

According to the most recent provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated **76,226** people in the United States died from overdoses involving synthetic opioids (primarily fentanyl) in 2023 [11]. The final number for 2022 was **74,702** [11].

Official statistics often categorize these deaths as involving "synthetic opioids other than methadone," which includes fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and tramadol [2, 11]. Fentanyl and its related substances are the primary driver of deaths within this category [2, 12].

The number of fentanyl-related deaths has increased sharply over time:
*   **2013:** 3,105 deaths were attributed to synthetic opioids other than methadone [1].
*   **2015:** The death toll rose to 9,580 [7]. That year, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued a nationwide alert about the dangers of fentanyl [4].
*   **2016:** Deaths more than doubled to 19,413 [7].
*   **2017:** The number of deaths reached 28,466 [5].
*   **2018:** There were 31,335 deaths involving these substances [8].
*   **2019:** The figure grew to 36,359 [6].
*   **2021:** The annual number of deaths surged to 70,601 [1, 2].

This trend highlights a more than 20-fold increase in annual deaths from synthetic opioids like fentanyl between 2013 and 2023 [1, 11].
