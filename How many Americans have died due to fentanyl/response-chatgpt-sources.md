# How many Americans have died due to fentanyl?

How many people have died depends on whether we look at one year or at the entire period for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been coding fentanyl-type deaths (the ICD-10 category “synthetic opioids other than methadone,” which today is almost entirely illicit fentanyl and its analogs).

1. Deaths in the most recent year on record  
   • 2022 (final NCHS data): 73,654 Americans died of an overdose involving synthetic opioids other than methadone (i.e., fentanyl) — about 70 % of all U.S. overdose deaths that year [1][2].

2. Cumulative deaths since national tracking began  
   • If the yearly CDC counts from 1999 (the first year the category was used) through 2022 are added together, the total comes to roughly 370,000 U.S. deaths attributable to fentanyl-type synthetic opioids [2].  
   • Provisional figures for 2023 (12-months ending November 2023) indicate another 75,000 deaths, which would bring the running total to well over 400,000 Americans lost to fentanyl since 1999 [1].

In short, fentanyl is now killing more than 70,000 Americans every year, and the cumulative death toll since 1999 has surpassed 370,000 (and is on track to top 400,000 once 2023 data are finalized).
