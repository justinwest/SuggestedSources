# How many Americans have died due to fentanyl?

**Answer: How Many Americans Have Died Due to Fentanyl?**

Fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid, has become a significant contributor to drug overdose deaths in the United States, with a dramatic rise in fatalities over recent years. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other authoritative sources, the number of Americans who have died due to fentanyl has increased sharply, particularly since the mid-2010s, as the drug has become more prevalent in the illicit drug supply.

While exact cumulative numbers for all fentanyl-related deaths over time are not always aggregated into a single figure across sources, the data provides a clear picture of the escalating crisis through annual statistics and trends. In 2013, fentanyl was involved in approximately 1,905 overdose deaths in the United States [6]. By 2016, this number had risen to 18,335 deaths [7], reflecting a nearly tenfold increase in just three years, largely driven by the influx of illicitly manufactured fentanyl. The trend continued to worsen, with fentanyl-involved deaths reaching 36,359 in 2019 [6]. More recent data indicates that in 2022, over 73,000 Americans died from overdoses involving synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl, accounting for a significant portion of the total 109,680 drug overdose deaths that year [11][12]. Provisional data for 2023 suggests a slight decline in overall drug overdose deaths to approximately 107,543, with synthetic opioids like fentanyl still playing a dominant role, though exact figures for fentanyl-specific deaths in 2023 are not fully finalized in the provided sources [11].

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and CDC data highlight that synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, have been the leading cause of overdose deaths since at least 2016, surpassing other drugs like prescription opioids and heroin [12][1]. USAFacts notes that fentanyl overdose deaths have risen by over 1,000% from 2013 to 2022, underscoring the scale of the epidemic [1]. While a precise total for all fentanyl-related deaths across all years is not explicitly provided in a single source, extrapolating from annual figures and trends suggests that hundreds of thousands of Americans have likely died due to fentanyl-involved overdoses since tracking became more detailed in the early 2010s.

It is important to note that many overdose deaths involve multiple substances, and fentanyl is often found in combination with other drugs like cocaine or methamphetamine, complicating attribution to a single cause [2][7]. Additionally, improvements in data collection and toxicology testing have enhanced the ability to identify fentanyl in overdose cases over time, which may partially account for the reported increases [2]. Nonetheless, the consensus across sources is clear: fentanyl has become a leading driver of the overdose crisis in the United States, claiming tens of thousands of lives annually in recent years.
