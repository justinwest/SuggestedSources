# What caused the crime spike in 2020 in the United States?

The sharp rise in homicide and gun assaults that appeared in 2020 does not trace to one single trigger.  Instead, criminologists and policy analysts point to a confluence of mutually reinforcing shocks that weakened the usual social and criminal-justice restraints on violence while simultaneously increasing the number of potentially violent encounters.

1. Pandemic-driven social disruption  
   • COVID-19 closed schools, recreation centers, courts and many social-service programs, removing the informal supervision that normally keeps disputes from escalating and slowing the adjudication of people already charged with violent offenses.  
   • Illness, quarantines and crowd-control rules limited proactive policing and community-based violence-intervention work.  
   • The pandemic also produced sudden unemployment, financial stress and mental-health problems that historically correlate with higher violence rates.  [2] [5] [8]

2. A collapse in police–community legitimacy and a measurable “pull-back” in policing after George Floyd’s murder  
   • Nationwide protests and a wave of anti-police sentiment were followed by budget cuts in some cities, rapid growth in officer resignations and retirements, and a documented fall in stops, arrests and gun seizures—the classic pattern of “de-policing.”  [1] [4] [6]  
   • When residents perceive police as illegitimate, they are less likely to call 911 or testify, reducing the certainty of punishment that deters violent retaliation.  [4] [5]

3. A record surge in firearm availability  
   • Americans bought an estimated 23 million guns in 2020, the largest annual total ever recorded.  New owners were disproportionately first-time buyers, increasing the probability that ordinary disputes or domestic incidents would be settled with a gun.  [7]  
   • The 2020 spike was concentrated in gun-related assaults and homicides; non-gun violent crime and property crime rose far less or even fell, suggesting that firearm prevalence magnified the lethality of conflicts.  [2] [4]

4. Disruptions inside the criminal-justice system  
   • Grand juries, trials and probation checks were postponed, meaning fewer offenders were incapacitated and violent crimes faced longer delays before sanction.  
   • To limit COVID spread, jails and prisons released large numbers of pre-trial detainees and low-level offenders, raising the share of high-risk individuals on the street.  [1] [5]

5. Local policy changes that lowered the cost of carrying weapons or engaging in risky behavior  
   • Several large jurisdictions simultaneously adopted bail reforms or announced that prosecutors would no longer pursue certain low-level offenses, diverting scarce court and police resources from gun crimes.  Critics argue this signaled diminished consequences for law-breaking and emboldened violent actors.  [1] [4]

How the factors interacted  
COVID-19 first weakened important informal (schools, community programs) and formal (police, courts) guardianship mechanisms.  The George Floyd protests then further strained police–community relations, produced policy and staffing shifts inside departments, and reduced the perceived legitimacy of law enforcement.  Into this vacuum poured a historically large stock of newly purchased firearms and an unusually high number of armed individuals on the street, raising the lethality of conflicts that might otherwise have ended in a fistfight.  Most scholars therefore describe the 2020 spike as the product of overlapping “pandemic effects” and a “legitimacy/de-policing shock,” amplified by unprecedented gun availability.  No single city’s experience contradicts this multi-causal explanation: places that saw the largest police pull-backs, the largest gun surges or the longest court shutdowns tended to record the steepest homicide increases.
