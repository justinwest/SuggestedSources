# What caused the crime spike in 2020 in the United States?

The 29 % jump in murders and the smaller but notable rise in other serious violence in 2020 did not stem from a single cause.  Researchers and practitioners point to several overlapping mechanisms that interacted over the course of the year.

1.  COVID-19–related social disruption  
   •  Stay-at-home orders closed schools, recreation centers, courts, and many social-service programs, removing informal guardianship and conflict-mediation outlets.  
   •  Police departments, courts, and probation/parole agencies curtailed normal operations, lengthening response times and leaving more high-risk people in the community after early-release or reduced pre-trial detention policies meant to slow the spread of the virus.  
   •  The pandemic produced economic and psychological stressors (job loss, isolation, substance abuse) that historically correlate with violence.  [2][3]

2.  Crisis of police legitimacy and “de-policing” after George Floyd’s murder (May 25, 2020)  
   •  Violent crime was roughly flat during the initial spring lockdown, then spiked sharply in late May and June, coinciding with nationwide protests.  Statistical work finds the increase largest in cities that experienced the most intense unrest.  Arrests for low-level offenses plummeted, and proactive stops, traffic enforcement, and gun searches fell, a pattern sometimes called the “Ferguson Effect 2.0.”  [1][4]  
   •  Surveys show public confidence in the police dropped to record lows, potentially lowering cooperation with investigations and emboldening retaliatory violence.  [2]

3.  Record firearm acquisition  
   •  Roughly 22 million guns were purchased in 2020—an unprecedented one-year increase, with many first-time buyers.  More guns in circulation increase the lethality of disputes when other risk factors are present.  [2][5]

4.  Shifts in local criminal-justice policy  
   •  To reduce jail crowding during the pandemic, thousands of low-level and pre-trial detainees were released.  
   •  In a number of large jurisdictions newly elected “progressive” prosecutors curtailed cash bail requests and declined to pursue certain gun and drug charges.  Heritage argues that these changes reduced incapacitation and deterrence, contributing to higher violence.  [1]

5.  Uneven community-level effects  
   •  The rise was highly concentrated: in many cities, a small number of neighborhoods with long-standing disinvestment and gang activity accounted for a majority of the additional homicides.  Where community-violence-intervention programs were forced to scale back because of COVID-19, shootings rose the most.  [3][4]

Consensus and remaining uncertainty  
All major data sources agree that murders rose dramatically while property crime fell, a pattern consistent with the idea that everyday opportunity structures (busy streets, open stores) were reduced by the pandemic while interpersonal conflicts intensified.  Researchers caution, however, that teasing out each factor’s weight is difficult; the best evidence so far indicates that the pandemic created fertile conditions for violence, and the subsequent policing crisis lit the match.  [2][4]
