# What caused the crime spike in 2020 in the United States?

Overview of the 2020 spike  
• 2020 saw the largest one-year rise in U.S. homicide on record (+29 % according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting and +28 % according to the CDC).  
• Aggravated assaults rose ~12 %. Robberies and most property crimes fell, but gun robberies, carjackings, and motor-vehicle thefts increased.  
• The spike began in late spring 2020 and persisted into 2021, though it eased somewhat in 2022.  

No single “smoking gun” explains the change; researchers point to several interacting mechanisms whose timing aligns with the uptick.

1. Pandemic-driven disruption of everyday life  
   • Routine-activity theory: Crime depends on motivated offenders, suitable targets, and absent guardianship. Stay-at-home orders, business closures, empty downtowns, and fewer bystanders removed informal guardians and altered target availability (e.g., more parked cars, vacant businesses).  
   • Economic stress: Unemployment hit 14.7 % in April 2020; although the short-term link between joblessness and violent crime is mixed, sudden income loss and underground-economy involvement can raise violence in high-poverty areas.  
   • Service contractions: Schools, recreation centers, violence-interruption programs, courts, and treatment facilities shut down or moved online. The pipeline that normally mediates disputes or offers alternatives to violence weakened, leaving conflicts to be handled informally and sometimes violently.  
   • Mental-health and substance-abuse strains: Isolation, anxiety, and higher alcohol and drug use elevated aggression risk.

2. Police pullback and strained legitimacy  
   • George Floyd’s murder on 25 May triggered nationwide protests, an estimated 15–26 million participants, and the most extensive civil unrest since the 1960s.  
   • “Ferguson-type” de-policing: Empirical studies using dispatch and arrest data in Chicago, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, and elsewhere show steep short-term drops in proactive activities such as traffic stops and street searches beginning in late May/June 2020, lasting months. Reduced visibility can lower deterrence and delay medical aid to shooting victims.  
   • Staffing and COVID absences: Hundreds of officers were sidelined by illness or quarantine, overtime budgets were cut, and training academies were paused.  
   • Legitimacy crisis: Community willingness to call 911 or cooperate fell in some neighborhoods after contentious police incidents, impeding case clearance and emboldening retaliatory violence.

3. Surge in firearm availability and carrying  
   • 21 million firearms were sold in 2020, up ~65 % from 2019; the FBI processed a record 39 million NICS checks.  
   • First-time purchasers were disproportionately younger and from urban areas. Research in Indianapolis, Philadelphia, and St. Louis finds that areas with the largest increases in gun thefts and new gun purchases had the sharpest spikes in shootings.  
   • More guns can escalate interpersonal conflicts that might otherwise end in assault or intimidation into lethal shootings.

4. Court and correctional system slowdowns  
   • Grand juries, trials, and sentencing hearings were postponed; detention centers reduced intakes to limit viral spread. Pre-trial detention declined ~25 % nationwide.  
   • Backlogged cases mean violent offenders remained in the community longer, and delayed consequences weakened deterrence perceptions.  
   • Early releases: Roughly 200,000 inmates left state and federal facilities early in 2020. Most were non-violent, but churn in reentry services and parole supervision disrupted oversight.

5. Social unrest and localized spikes  
   • Cities that experienced the most intense protests (Minneapolis, Portland, Louisville, Kenosha) saw the steepest homicide growth. Scholars debate whether violence stemmed directly from protests or from opportunistic criminal activity amid stretched police resources.  
   • Nightly clashes and curfews concentrated police attention on crowd control, diverting it from high-violence hot spots.

6. Decline in informal and formal guardianship of youth  
   • With school closures, adolescents spent more unsupervised time. Juvenile homicide victimization and offending both jumped (~30 %).  
   • Mandatory reporters (teachers, coaches) were not seeing students in person, weakening early intervention for abuse or gang recruitment.

7. Other contributing factors  
   • Drug market volatility: Supply-chain disruptions, price spikes, and increased fentanyl penetration raised violence risk in some markets.  
   • Urban demographic shifts: Wealthier residents worked remotely or left cities, leaving behind communities already disproportionately exposed to violence.  
   • Weather and seasonality: 2020 had an unusually warm summer in many parts of the country, historically correlated with higher violence.

Evidence against single-factor explanations  
• Not solely COVID: Violent crime rose more in U.S. cities than in peer nations that also locked down.  
• Not solely protests: The rise began before some protests and occurred in cities with minimal unrest, though the timing matches sharp accelerations.  
• Not driven by bail reform or “defund” budgets alone: Few major cuts took effect until FY 2021; most bail policy changes preceded 2020 spikes, and some states without reforms (e.g., Missouri) saw large increases.

Limitations of current research  
• 2020 was unique, making standard panel models tricky; most studies rely on short time horizons and cannot fully isolate causality.  
• National FBI numbers for 2020 omit some large agencies that converted to NIBRS reporting (e.g., New York City), so local data and CDC mortality figures help corroborate trends.  
• County-level heterogeneity is high; in a quarter of counties homicides actually fell.

Synthesis  
The 2020 crime spike emerged from an acute convergence of stressors: pandemic-induced social and economic upheaval, a legitimacy crisis for policing that curtailed enforcement and cooperation, an unprecedented flood of firearms, and systemic slowdowns in courts and social services. Each mechanism on its own has modest explanatory power, but together they created an environment with more motivated offenders, fewer capable guardians (both police and community), quicker escalation to gun violence, and longer delays before formal sanctions—conditions that criminological theory predicts will elevate serious violent crime.
