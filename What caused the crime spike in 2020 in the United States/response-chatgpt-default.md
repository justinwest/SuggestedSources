# What caused the crime spike in 2020 in the United States?

Magnitude and shape of the spike  
•  According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, murders rose about 29 percent between 2019 and 2020—the largest single-year increase recorded since national data collection began in 1960.  
•  Aggravated assaults increased roughly 10 percent. Most other violent offenses (e.g., robberies) edged up modestly or fell; burglaries and larcenies declined.  
•  Nearly 77 percent of 2020 homicides involved firearms, up from 74 percent in 2019.  
•  The surge was nationwide: 85 percent of cities with populations over 250,000 experienced a homicide rise, but the magnitude differed sharply across places.

Why no single cause is sufficient  
Violent crime is multi-factorial; researchers find no single variable explains even half the 2020 jump. Instead, several forces converged, many of them mutually reinforcing:

1. COVID-19-related social and economic disruption  
   •  Economic shock: Unemployment leapt from 3.5 percent in February to 14.7 percent in April, historically associated with higher violence in disadvantaged neighborhoods.  
   •  Routine-activity shifts: Stay-at-home orders closed schools, parks, and recreation centers that normally provide informal guardianship and conflict mediation for youth; more unsupervised time in high-risk environments.  
   •  Service interruptions: Violence-intervention programs, mental-health clinics, probation visits, and drug-treatment services curtailed face-to-face work just as stress, substance use, and firearm carrying rose.  
   •  Court slowdown and decarceration: Grand juries were suspended, trials postponed, and many jails reduced populations to slow viral spread. Delayed incapacitation and supervision may have elevated repeat-offense risk for a small subset of high-rate offenders.

2. Police pullbacks and strained legitimacy after George Floyd’s murder  
   •  Nationwide demonstrations beginning 26 May 2020 intensified community–police mistrust.  
   •  Several studies (e.g., Rosenfeld, Lopez & Zimmer 2022) show sharp, temporary drops in proactive policing (e.g., traffic stops, street stops) immediately after highly publicized uses of force; those declines correlate with short-term spikes in shootings.  
   •  Officer availability fell because of COVID sickness/quarantine, overtime caps, and early retirements; case-clearance rates for homicide and non-fatal shootings declined in many large cities.  
   •  The “Minneapolis effect” (analogous to the 2015–16 “Ferguson effect”) posits that reduced police self-initiation, combined with emboldened retaliatory violence, contributed meaningfully to the mid-summer surge.

3. Record gun purchasing and circulation  
   •  National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) firearm checks hit 21 million in 2020, a 40 percent jump from 2019; estimates suggest 5–8 million first-time buyers.  
   •  Studies using state-level time-series (e.g., Schleimer et al. 2022) attribute 8–18 percent of the homicide increase to excess gun sales, after adjusting for pandemic and protest timing.  
   •  More guns in both the legal and illicit markets increased the lethality of interpersonal disputes.

4. Concentrated neighborhood effects  
   •  The rise in shootings was extremely concentrated in high-poverty census tracts that already suffered from elevated rates of gun violence.  
   •  Local mutual-aid organizations and violence-interruption crews (for example, Cure Violence, Advance Peace, Chicago CRED) reported diminished street presence during the first six months of the pandemic, leaving conflicts to escalate unchecked.

5. Mental-health strain and interpersonal conflict  
   •  CDC surveys documented an unprecedented jump in anxiety, depression, and substance misuse in mid-2020.  
   •  Domestic-violence service hotlines and hospital injury data reveal increases in severity, although 911 DV calls were mixed across jurisdictions.  
   •  Alcohol sales for off-premise consumption rose 14 percent; alcohol is a known co-factor in roughly one-third of violent incidents.

Factors that appear less important  
•  Bail reform and “defund” budget cuts were limited in geographic scope and mostly took effect in mid- to late-2021.  
•  Legalization or decriminalization of cannabis does not align temporally with the spike and has little empirical connection to violent-crime trends.  
•  Immigration changes are likewise inconsistent with the timing or structure of the homicide rise.

Empirical weight of each factor  
Quantifying exact shares is difficult because many causes overlap, but meta-analyses and panel studies suggest approximate contributions:  
•  Pandemic-related social disruption and service/court shutdowns: 30–40 percent.  
•  Policing pullbacks and legitimacy crisis: 20–30 percent.  
•  Surge in gun purchasing/availability: 10–20 percent.  
•  Economic shock and unemployment: 5–10 percent.  
•  Other factors (mental-health stress, decarceration, localized gang conflict): remainder.  
These ranges are illustrative, not definitive; confidence intervals are wide.

What happened to non-violent crime?  
•  Property crime fell 8 percent overall; thefts from businesses dropped as stores closed, and residential burglary fell while more people stayed home.  
•  Auto thefts were a major exception, rising 11 percent—likely because vehicles were left parked for long periods and supply-chain shortages raised used-car values.

Regional variation  
•  The homicide increase was larger in some Midwestern metro areas (Milwaukee +95 %, Chicago +55 %, St. Louis +35 %) than in most Northeastern cities.  
•  Rural counties experienced elevated homicide but from a much lower baseline; the absolute number of additional deaths was concentrated in a few dozen cities.

Conclusion  
The 2020 crime spike, especially in homicides and shootings, was not the product of one policy change or demographic shift. Instead, it grew out of an unprecedented convergence of:  
(1) pandemic-driven upheaval in daily life, social services, and the justice system;  
(2) an erosion of police activity and legitimacy following a highly visible instance of police violence;  
(3) a historic surge in gun purchasing and carrying; and  
(4) acute economic and psychological stress in already vulnerable communities.  
Each of these forces amplified the others, creating conditions in which interpersonal conflicts were more frequent, police and community guardianship were weaker, and the tools to turn disputes deadly were more readily at hand.
