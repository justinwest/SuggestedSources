# What caused the crime spike in 2020 in the United States?

Overview  
• The “crime spike” of 2020 in the United States was concentrated in gun violence and homicide.  FBI Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) show murders rising about 29 % from 2019—the largest one-year jump on record—while aggravated assaults rose 12 %.  By contrast, burglaries fell and larcenies declined sharply.  
• Criminologists agree that no single trigger can fully explain the surge; instead, several overlapping shocks hit the nation at once, each affecting the mechanisms that normally keep violence in check.  The main forces identified by peer-reviewed studies, government analyses, and blue-ribbon commissions are summarized below.

1. COVID-19 pandemic and the social-routine disruption  
   • Routine Activity Theory predicts crime patterns change when daily activities, guardianship, and targets shift.  Pandemic lockdowns closed schools, recreation centers, bars, and many social services, pushing more interactions into unregulated private spaces where disputes more easily turn lethal.  
   • Court systems, probation offices, and violence-intervention programs curtailed operations.  Many street-outreach workers report they could not mediate gang conflicts or perform hospital-based interventions during key months of 2020.  
   • Medical and economic stress increased trauma, substance abuse, and mental-health crises, all linked to violence risk.  CDC Household Pulse Surveys found clinically significant anxiety/depression symptoms doubled in mid-2020.  
   • While overall unemployment effects on violent crime are mixed historically, the abrupt loss of millions of low-wage jobs concentrated in already high-crime neighborhoods removed informal social controls and elevated economic strain.

2. Collapse in police–community legitimacy and “pull-back” after George Floyd’s murder  
   • The May 25, 2020 killing of George Floyd sparked the largest nationwide protests in U.S. history.  Research by Rosenfeld, Abt & Lopez (Council on Criminal Justice, 2021) and De-Boef & Rosenfeld (2023) finds homicide growth steepest in June–August, immediately after the protests.  
   • Surveys (e.g., Gallup, Pew) show trust in police dropped sharply among both Black and White Americans in mid-2020.  Lower legitimacy generally reduces 9-1-1 calls and witness cooperation, hampering clearance rates and deterrence.  
   • Numerous city-level studies (Abrams 2021; Wheeler et al. 2022) document a measurable decline in proactive stops, traffic enforcement, and pedestrian checks after the protests—often called “de-policing.”  Reduced visibility and deterrence can raise gun carrying and retaliatory shootings.  
   • Important nuance: property crimes did not soar, suggesting the mechanism was specific to violence and gun conflicts rather than a blanket retreat from all policing.

3. Surge in firearm purchasing and availability  
   • FBI NICS background‐check data show an estimated 22 million firearms were purchased in 2020, a 64 % increase over 2019 and the highest annual total ever recorded.  First-time buyers and purchasers in high-crime areas rose disproportionately.  
   • Empirical work (Schleimer et al., Annals of Internal Medicine 2021) associates the excess gun purchases of early 2020 with an 8 % rise in firearm violence nationally, controlling for COVID-19 effects.  
   • More guns in circulation raise both the likelihood disputes will involve a weapon and the lethality of assaults.

4. Weakening of the criminal-justice “guardianship” system  
   • Police staffing: COVID infections, quarantines, and retirements produced double-digit sworn-officer vacancy rates in many large agencies by late 2020.  
   • Court backlogs: Many jurisdictions paused grand juries, slowed arraignments, and released some detainees to lower jail crowding.  Although research is mixed on whether releases increased crime, delays reduced the swiftness of sanctions, undercutting deterrence.  
   • Youth institutions: School closures removed the most consistent formal supervision many adolescents receive and eliminated school-based officers or counselors who often mediate conflicts before they spill into the streets.

5. Concentrated neighborhood dynamics and gang conflicts  
   • Homicide increases were intensely localized: blocks that already had shootings often saw the largest growth (e.g., Chicago, Philadelphia, New York data from the National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice).  
   • Interruption of street-outreach programs, combined with the factors above, allowed tit-for-tat retaliations to accelerate.  Social media disputes—amplified because young people were online more—fed into real-world gunfire.

6. Misinterpreted or minor contributors  
   • Bail reform, progressive prosecutors, and marijuana legalization were frequently blamed in public debate, but time-series and cross-city comparisons show little consistent relationship to the 2020 spike.  Many jurisdictions with no reforms saw similar homicide jumps, while some with major reforms did not.  
   • Immigration levels, often linked in political rhetoric to crime, actually fell sharply in 2020 because of global travel restrictions; homicide still rose.

Remaining uncertainties  
• Because multiple shocks were simultaneous, isolating causal weights is challenging; effect sizes reported in individual studies range widely.  
• Data quality in 2020 suffered: the FBI’s transition to NIBRS and pandemic-related reporting delays leave margins of error in national figures.  
• Longitudinal research is still underway to parse lasting versus temporary effects; early 2022 data suggest homicide fell slightly from 2021 highs but remained well above 2019.

Conclusion  
The 2020 spike in U.S. violent crime, particularly homicide, was the product of converging crises: the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted daily life and weakened institutions; the George Floyd protests fractured police-community relations and curtailed proactive enforcement; an unprecedented surge in gun purchasing increased the lethality of conflicts; and court, school, and social-service slowdowns removed crucial violence-prevention buffers.  Each element alone would strain public-safety ecosystems; together they produced the steepest one-year rise in lethal violence on record.  Although crime levels eased somewhat in later years, the episode underscores how social, health, and justice systems interact to influence violence trends, and why multidimensional strategies are required to prevent future spikes.
