Based on the provided sources, there is no single, universally agreed-upon cause for the spike in crime in the United States in 2020. Instead, the sources present several distinct and sometimes conflicting theories, highlighting the complexity of the issue. The primary explanations offered are changes in policing and justice policy, a societal "legitimacy crisis," the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase in firearm sales.

### Key Theories on the Cause of the 2020 Crime Spike

**1. De-policing and Progressive Justice Policies**
One prominent theory argues that the crime spike was a direct result of significant changes in policing and prosecution following the death of George Floyd [1]. This perspective suggests that widespread protests and the "defund the police" movement led to "de-policing," where officers pulled back from proactive enforcement out of fear of public backlash or accusations of misconduct [1]. This view also points to the election of progressive prosecutors who declined to prosecute lower-level crimes and the implementation of bail reform measures that released more defendants before trial [1]. The Heritage Foundation article asserts that these policy shifts, not the pandemic or gun sales, are the primary drivers of the crime increase [1].

**2. A "Legitimacy Crisis" in the Justice System**
Another source puts forth the idea of a "legitimacy crisis" as the main cause [3]. This theory posits that events in 2020, particularly the killing of George Floyd, severely eroded public trust in the police and the broader justice system. This breakdown in legitimacy had two major effects:
*   Citizens became less willing to cooperate with police or rely on them to resolve disputes.
*   Individuals felt more justified in taking matters into their own hands, leading to an increase in street justice and violence [3].

This source argues that this crisis, amplified by the social disruptions of the pandemic, is a more robust explanation than "de-policing" or gun sales alone [3].

**3. The COVID-19 Pandemic and Social Stress**
The Pew Research Center notes that many experts point to the social and economic upheaval caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as a potential factor [2]. The pandemic caused widespread stress, closed schools and social institutions, and disrupted daily life, which may have contributed to the rise in violence [2, 3]. While the Heritage Foundation dismisses the pandemic's role as a "red herring" [1], the other sources consider its disruptive effects a significant contributing or amplifying factor [2, 3].

**4. Increased Firearm Purchases**
The historic rise in firearm sales during 2020 is cited by some experts as another possible explanation for the increase in murders [2]. However, the sources present a divided view on the importance of this factor.
*   Pew Research includes it as one of several plausible explanations offered by experts [2].
*   The Heritage Foundation article explicitly rejects this theory [1].
*   The Inquisitive Bird analysis argues against it as a primary cause, noting that previous spikes in gun sales have not always correlated with spikes in violent crime [3].

In summary, while all sources acknowledge the significant crime spike in 2020—particularly the nearly 30% jump in the murder rate [2]—they offer different primary causes. The explanations range from specific policy decisions and police behavior [1] to a broad societal breakdown of trust in institutions [3], with the COVID-19 pandemic and gun sales serving as either potential primary causes or contributing factors depending on the analysis [2].

### Sources

1.  **The Heritage Foundation.** This source presents a clear and assertive viewpoint, arguing that the crime spike was caused by deliberate policy choices. It identifies "de-policing," the "defund the police" movement, progressive prosecutors, and bail reform as the primary causes, while dismissing other theories like the pandemic and gun sales as "red herrings."

2.  **Pew Research Center.** This source takes a neutral, data-focused approach. It does not champion one specific cause but instead outlines several plausible theories that experts have proposed. These include the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in policing following the George Floyd protests, and the increase in firearm sales, noting that there is no consensus among experts.

3.  **Inquisitive Bird.** This source offers a detailed analytical argument. After examining and largely dismissing the "de-policing" and "gun sales" theories as primary drivers, it concludes that a "legitimacy crisis" in the justice system, exacerbated by the social disruptions of the pandemic, is the most likely cause for the crime spike.
