# What caused the crime spike in 2020 in the United States?

The significant spike in crime, particularly homicides, in the United States during 2020 was not caused by a single factor, but rather a combination of unprecedented and interconnected events [2, 5]. While different experts and organizations place varying levels of emphasis on each cause, the most frequently cited factors are the societal disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic, a crisis in policing and community relations following the murder of George Floyd, and a historic surge in gun purchases [2, 8].

Key contributing factors include:

*   **The COVID-19 Pandemic and Societal Disruption:** The pandemic caused profound upheaval in daily life, creating conditions conducive to violence. Lockdowns, economic anxiety from mass job losses, and the closure of schools and community centers generated immense stress and idleness [5, 8]. Furthermore, the pandemic severely hampered or shut down crucial social services, including mental health support, substance abuse programs, and community-based violence interruption initiatives that normally help to de-escalate conflicts [5].

*   **Strained Police-Community Relations and Changes in Policing:** The murder of George Floyd in May 2020 and the subsequent nationwide protests against police brutality led to a crisis of legitimacy for law enforcement [2, 4]. This had two major effects:
    1.  **A "Pullback" in Proactive Policing:** Some analysts argue that in the face of intense public scrutiny, protests, and calls to "defund the police," officers became less proactive in their duties. This phenomenon, sometimes called a "Ferguson Effect" or "de-policing," may have emboldened criminals by creating a perception of reduced law enforcement presence [1, 4]. Some police departments officially pulled back on certain types of enforcement to minimize public contact during the pandemic, which may have also contributed [2].
    2.  **Erosion of Public Trust:** Widespread distrust of the police, particularly in minority communities, may have made residents less willing to cooperate with investigations or report crimes, potentially leading to more disputes being settled through violence rather than the justice system [4, 5].

*   **A Surge in Gun Purchases:** 2020 saw a record-breaking number of gun sales in the United States [2, 7]. Research indicates a direct correlation between the proliferation of firearms and an increase in gun violence. The heightened anxiety from the pandemic, social unrest, and political polarization fueled this surge in purchases. With more guns in circulation, disagreements and altercations were more likely to turn deadly [5, 7].

*   **Police Department Staffing and Turnover:** Beyond a change in proactive tactics, police departments also faced practical challenges. One academic study found a significant link between rising rates of police officer resignations and increasing crime rates in 2020. This turnover can strain a department's resources and reduce its effectiveness [6].

In summary, experts do not point to one single cause for the 2020 crime spike. Rather, they describe a "perfect storm" where the pandemic destabilized society and shut down support systems, the protests against police brutality transformed the nature of policing and community trust, and a massive influx of firearms made a volatile situation more lethal [2, 8].

    This conservative think tank argues that the primary causes were the "de-policing" that followed the George Floyd protests, anti-police rhetoric that demoralized officers, and the policies of progressive prosecutors who reduced charges for certain crimes.

    Pew provides a data-centric overview, noting the historic 30% increase in murders. It avoids taking a definitive stance on the cause but presents the leading theories discussed by experts, including the effects of the pandemic, changes in policing, and the surge in gun sales.

3.  **[Crime in the USA](https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/crime-in-the-usa) – *Patterns in Humanity***
    This analysis places the 2020 spike in a broader historical context, showing that while the single-year increase was dramatic, overall crime rates remain far below their peaks in the early 1990s. It suggests the causes are complex and resists simple explanations, pointing to a confluence of factors.

    This article from a conservative-leaning think tank focuses heavily on the "crisis of police legitimacy" following the George Floyd protests. It argues that a pullback in proactive policing and a decline in community trust were central drivers of the homicide increase.

    This center-left research institute pushes back on theories centered on criminal justice reform or "de-policing." It argues that the evidence instead points to the profound social and economic disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and the dramatic increase in gun sales as the primary drivers of the violence.

    This academic study provides empirical evidence of a link between rising police officer turnover (specifically resignations) and increased crime rates. It suggests that staffing instability within police departments was a significant contributing factor in 2020.

7.  **[Gun violence rise linked to record gun purchases](https://www.axios.com/2021/07/12/gun-violence-rise-gun-purchases) – *Axios***
    This article highlights the direct correlation between the record-breaking number of gun purchases in 2020 and the simultaneous rise in gun violence, citing research that connects increased firearm availability to higher rates of violence.

    This news report discusses a study by the National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice. It attributes the spike to a "double helix" of intertwined factors: the COVID-19 pandemic and the mass protests over police violence, which together created a uniquely volatile environment.
