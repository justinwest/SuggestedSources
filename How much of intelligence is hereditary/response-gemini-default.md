# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

The question of how much of intelligence is hereditary is one of the most studied and debated topics in psychology and behavioral genetics. The scientific consensus is that intelligence has a substantial genetic component, but its development is the result of a complex and dynamic interplay between genes and the environment.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the current scientific understanding.

### 1. Defining "Intelligence" and "Heritability"

To understand the answer, we must first be precise about the terms used in the research.

*   **Intelligence:** In research, "intelligence" is most often operationalized as the **general intelligence factor, or 'g'**. This is a statistical measure derived from performance on a wide variety of cognitive tests (e.g., verbal reasoning, spatial visualization, memory, processing speed). IQ (Intelligence Quotient) tests are designed to be a primary measure of 'g'. While there are debates about whether 'g' captures the full scope of human intelligence, it remains a robust and predictive construct in psychology.

*   **Heritability:** This is the most misunderstood term in the debate. Heritability is **not** the percentage of an individual's intelligence that they get from their parents. Instead, it is a **population statistic**. It estimates the proportion of the **observed variation** in a trait (like IQ scores) among individuals **within a specific population** that can be attributed to genetic differences among those individuals.

    *   **An Analogy:** The number of fingers a person has is determined by genetics. However, the heritability of "having 10 fingers" in most populations is nearly 0%. This is because the variation in the number of fingers (e.g., people having fewer than 10) is almost entirely due to environmental factors like accidents, not genetic differences. High heritability means that the differences we see *between people* are largely explained by their genetic differences.

### 2. The Core Findings: How Much is Heritable?

Decades of research, primarily using twin and adoption studies, have produced consistent results.

*   **The General Figure:** The heritability of intelligence is typically estimated to be between **50% and 80%**. This means that 50-80% of the differences in IQ scores among people in the studied populations can be accounted for by their genetic differences. This makes intelligence one of the most heritable behavioral traits ever studied.

*   **How We Know This (The Evidence):**
    *   **Twin Studies:** These are the bedrock of heritability research. By comparing identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins, who share 100% of their genes, to fraternal (dizygotic, DZ) twins, who share on average 50% of their genes, researchers can disentangle genetic and environmental influences. The consistent finding is that identical twins have far more similar IQ scores than fraternal twins, even when they are reared apart in different families.
    *   **Adoption Studies:** These studies compare adopted children's IQs to those of their biological parents (who provided the genes) and their adoptive parents (who provided the home environment). Children's IQ scores correlate more strongly with their biological parents' IQs than with their adoptive parents' IQs, a correlation that strengthens as the children age.

### 3. Key Nuances and Complexities

The 50-80% figure is a starting point, not the end of the story. The relationship between genes and intelligence is far from simple.

#### Heritability Increases with Age
This is one of the most fascinating and counter-intuitive findings in the field.
*   **In Infancy:** Heritability of IQ is low, around 20%.
*   **In Childhood:** It rises to about 40%.
*   **In Adolescence and Adulthood:** It reaches as high as 60-80%.

**Why does this happen?** The leading theory is **gene-environment correlation (rGE)**. As people get older, they gain more autonomy to select, modify, and create their own environments. Individuals with a genetic predisposition for higher cognitive ability may actively seek out more intellectually stimulating environments (e.g., reading complex books, engaging in debate, pursuing higher education). This "niche-picking" allows their genetic potential to be more fully expressed over time, thus increasing the role of genetics in explaining the differences between people as they age.

#### The Environment is Critically Important
A high heritability estimate does **not** mean the environment is unimportant. Genes do not operate in a vacuum.
*   **The Flynn Effect:** This refers to the substantial and long-sustained increase in both fluid and crystallized intelligence test scores measured in many parts of the world from the 1930s to the present day. This rapid rise in population-level IQ (about 3 points per decade) cannot be explained by genetics, which change far too slowly. It is powerful evidence for the role of environmental factors, such as improved nutrition, better and more widespread education, and increased societal complexity.
*   **Socioeconomic Status (SES):** In environments of low SES, with significant deprivation (e.g., poor nutrition, stress, lack of educational resources), the influence of the environment on IQ is much stronger, and the heritability is lower. In these conditions, many individuals may not have the environmental resources necessary to reach their genetic potential. Conversely, in affluent environments, where basic needs are met and educational opportunities are abundant, heritability is higher because the environmental factors are more uniform, allowing genetic differences to become the primary source of variation.

#### Gene-Environment Interaction (GxE)
This refers to how genes can influence a person's susceptibility to environmental factors. For example, some individuals may have a genetic makeup that allows them to benefit more from a high-quality education than others. The effect of the environment is not the same for everyone; it depends on their underlying genetics.

### 4. The Search for "Intelligence Genes"

With modern technology, scientists are searching for the specific genes involved.
*   **Highly Polygenic:** There is no single "intelligence gene." Intelligence is a **highly polygenic** trait, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genes, each having a very small effect.
*   **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS):** These studies scan the entire genomes of tens of thousands of people. They have successfully identified hundreds of specific genetic variants (SNPs) associated with educational attainment and cognitive performance. However, all of these variants combined still only explain a fraction of the 50-80% heritability found in twin studies, a phenomenon known as the "missing heritability" problem.

### Conclusion

To summarize, the answer to "how much of intelligence is hereditary" is:

1.  **A Significant Amount:** Intelligence, as measured by IQ tests, is one of the most heritable psychological traits. Twin and adoption studies consistently place its heritability between 50% and 80% in adult populations.
2.  **It's a Population Statistic:** This number refers to the proportion of variation *within a group* that is due to genetics; it does not mean that 50-80% of any *individual's* IQ is fixed by their genes.
3.  **It's Not Deterministic:** High heritability does not imply that intelligence is unchangeable. Environmental factors, such as education, nutrition, and socioeconomic status, have a profound impact on cognitive development, as evidenced by the Flynn Effect.
4.  **It's a Lifelong Interaction:** The modern view is not nature *versus* nurture, but nature *via* nurture. Genes and environments are in a constant, dynamic interplay. Our genes influence the environments we seek out, and those environments, in turn, shape how our genetic predispositions are expressed.
