The question of how much intelligence is hereditary is one of the most extensively studied and debated topics in behavioral genetics. The scientific consensus is that intelligence, as measured by cognitive tests (IQ scores), is substantially heritable, but environmental factors are also critically important. There is no single number that provides a complete answer, as the influence of genetics changes over time and interacts with the environment.

### 1. The Concept of Heritability

Before discussing the findings, it is crucial to understand what "heritability" means. Heritability (often denoted as *h²*) is a statistical concept that estimates the proportion of the observed *differences* (variance) in a trait among individuals *within a specific population* that can be attributed to genetic differences among those individuals [1, 2].

It is important to note what heritability is **not**:
*   It does not mean that a certain percentage of an *individual's* intelligence is fixed by their genes.
*   It is a population statistic, not a statement about an individual's potential.
*   A high heritability does not imply that the environment is unimportant or that the trait is unchangeable. For example, height is highly heritable, yet average height has increased dramatically over the last century due to improved nutrition [4].

### 2. Evidence from Twin and Adoption Studies

The primary evidence for the heritability of intelligence comes from classical quantitative genetics, mainly through twin and adoption studies [3].

*   **Twin Studies:** These studies compare the similarity of a trait in identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins, who share 100% of their genes, to fraternal (dizygotic, DZ) twins, who share on average 50% of their genes. If identical twins are significantly more similar in intelligence than fraternal twins, this suggests a strong genetic influence.
*   **Adoption Studies:** These studies examine children who were adopted at a young age. The correlation of their IQ scores with their biological parents (who provided the genes) is compared to the correlation with their adoptive parents (who provided the family environment).

A meta-analysis of decades of these studies shows a consistent pattern: the heritability of intelligence is substantial. Across numerous studies, the average heritability estimate for intelligence is approximately **50%** when considering results from all ages [1].

### 3. The Influence of Age on Heritability

A remarkable and consistently replicated finding is that the heritability of intelligence **increases with age** [3]. This phenomenon is sometimes called the "Wilson Effect."

*   In **infancy**, heritability is low, around **20%**.
*   In **childhood**, it increases to about **40%**.
*   In **adolescence and adulthood**, it rises to approximately **60%**.
*   In **late adulthood**, some studies have estimated it to be as high as **80%** [1, 3].

This may seem counterintuitive, as one might expect environmental influences to accumulate over a lifetime. The leading explanation is **gene-environment correlation (rGE)**. As individuals grow older, they gain more autonomy to select, modify, and create environments that are compatible with their genetic predispositions. For example, a child with a genetic predisposition for high verbal ability may actively seek out books, enjoy school, and pursue intellectually stimulating hobbies, thereby amplifying their initial genetic advantage [1].

### 4. The Role of the Environment

A heritability estimate of 50-80% means that 20-50% of the variance in intelligence is attributable to environmental factors. These factors are typically divided into two categories:

*   **Shared Environment:** Factors that make individuals raised in the same family similar (e.g., parental socioeconomic status, home environment, nutrition, parenting style). The influence of the shared environment is strongest in childhood and decreases significantly by adolescence [1].
*   **Non-shared Environment:** Factors that are unique to an individual and make family members different from one another (e.g., different friends, unique life events, illnesses, differential parental treatment). The influence of the non-shared environment appears to be more significant and persistent throughout life.

Specific environmental factors known to impact cognitive ability include nutrition (especially iodine and iron sufficiency), exposure to toxins (like lead), and the quality and duration of education [4]. The **Flynn Effect**—the observed rise in IQ scores of about three points per decade throughout the 20th century in many parts of the world—is the strongest evidence for the powerful role of environmental factors, as the human gene pool could not have changed that rapidly [4].

### 5. Modern Genetic Research: The Polygenic Nature of Intelligence

With the advent of genomic technology, researchers can now look for specific genes associated with intelligence. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) scan the entire genome to find genetic variants (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) associated with a trait.

These studies have revealed that intelligence is highly **polygenic**, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genes, each with an extremely small effect [5]. There is no single "gene for intelligence." Using this data, researchers can create **Polygenic Scores (PGS)**, which aggregate the effects of thousands of identified SNPs. Currently, these scores can account for over 10% of the variance in educational attainment and intelligence, a figure that is expected to grow as sample sizes in GWAS studies increase [1, 5]. This confirms the findings of twin studies but also highlights the complexity of the genetic architecture of intelligence.

### 6. Gene-Environment Interaction (GxE)

The "nature vs. nurture" debate is now understood to be an oversimplification. Genes and environment do not just add up; they interact. **Gene-Environment Interaction (GxE)** occurs when the effect of the environment on a trait depends on a person's genotype, or conversely, when the effect of a genotype depends on the environment [6].

For example, some studies suggest that the heritability of intelligence is lower in families of low socioeconomic status (SES) and higher in families of high SES. This implies that a supportive and enriched environment may be necessary for individuals to fully realize their genetic potential for cognitive ability. In a deprived environment, genetic differences may have less opportunity to manifest [6].

### Conclusion

In summary, the most accurate answer to "How much of intelligence is hereditary?" is that genetics play a major role, but their influence is not static or deterministic.

1.  On average, heritability is estimated to be around **50%**, but this figure rises from about **20% in infancy to as high as 80% in later adulthood**.
2.  Intelligence is highly **polygenic**, with thousands of genes contributing small effects.
3.  The environment is crucial, both in its direct effects (like schooling and nutrition) and through its complex **interaction and correlation** with genetic predispositions. Genes are not destiny; they are probabilistic propensities that are shaped and expressed through a lifetime of environmental interplay.
