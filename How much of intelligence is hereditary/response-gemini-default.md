# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

The question of how much intelligence is hereditary is one of the most studied, and most contentious, in all of psychology and genetics. There is no simple percentage that serves as a final answer, as the relationship between genes and intelligence is complex, dynamic, and heavily influenced by the environment. However, decades of research have produced a strong scientific consensus.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the current understanding.

### 1. Defining "Intelligence" and "Heritability"

Before addressing the core question, it's crucial to understand the two key terms:

*   **Intelligence:** In this context, "intelligence" almost always refers to **psychometric intelligence**, which is the cognitive ability measured by standardized IQ (Intelligence Quotient) tests. These tests are designed to assess abilities like reasoning, problem-solving, abstract thinking, and knowledge acquisition. The general factor derived from these tests is known as **"g" (general intelligence factor)**, and it is this "g" that is the primary subject of heritability studies.
*   **Heritability:** This is the most misunderstood concept in the debate. Heritability is a statistical measure, represented as a number between 0 and 1 (or 0% and 100%), that estimates **how much of the *variation* in a trait *within a specific population* is due to genetic differences among individuals in that population.**

It is critical to understand what heritability is **NOT**:
*   It does **not** mean that X% of an *individual's* intelligence is determined by their genes. It is a population-level statistic, not an individual one.
*   It is **not** a fixed, universal constant. The heritability of a trait can change depending on the population being studied and their environmental circumstances.
*   High heritability does **not** mean a trait is unchangeable (i.e., genetically determined). For example, height is highly heritable (~80-90%), yet average height has increased dramatically over the last century due to better nutrition (an environmental factor).

### 2. The Scientific Consensus: A Shifting Figure

The broad consensus from a century of research is that the heritability of intelligence is substantial. Most estimates place it in the range of **50% to 80%**. However, this figure is not static; it changes dramatically over an individual's lifespan.

*   **In Early Childhood:** Heritability of IQ is relatively low, around **20% to 40%**. In this stage, environmental factors, such as family environment, nutrition, and early education, have a larger proportional effect on the variation in IQ scores.
*   **In Adolescence:** Heritability rises to approximately **60%**.
*   **In Adulthood:** Heritability reaches its peak, with most studies converging on a figure as high as **80%**.

This increase is a surprising finding. One might expect the influence of genes to wane as life experiences accumulate. The leading explanation for this phenomenon is **gene-environment correlation (rGE)**, which means that individuals' genetic predispositions lead them to select, modify, and create environments that are compatible with and reinforce those predispositions. For example, a child with a genetic predisposition for higher cognitive ability may seek out more books, enjoy complex puzzles, and ask more questions, thereby actively shaping an intellectually stimulating environment that further enhances their abilities.

### 3. Key Lines of Evidence

The estimates for heritability are derived from several converging lines of evidence in behavioral genetics.

*   **Twin Studies:** This is the classic method. By comparing identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins, who share 100% of their genes, to fraternal (dizygotic, DZ) twins, who share on average 50% of their genes, researchers can parse out genetic and environmental influences. If a trait is more similar in MZ twins than in DZ twins, it suggests a genetic contribution. For IQ, the correlation for MZ twins raised together is very high (~0.86), while for DZ twins it is significantly lower (~0.60), pointing to a strong genetic influence.
*   **Adoption Studies:** These studies are powerful because they separate genetic inheritance from environmental influence. The IQ of adopted children tends to correlate more strongly with their **biological parents** (from whom they get their genes) than with their **adoptive parents** (who provide their environment). This provides strong evidence for heritability.
*   **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS):** With modern technology, scientists can analyze the entire genomes of large populations. These studies have shown that intelligence is highly **polygenic**, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genes, each with a very small effect. There is no single "intelligence gene." GWAS have successfully identified numerous specific genetic variants (SNPs) associated with educational attainment and cognitive function, though all of them combined still only account for a fraction of the total heritability estimated by twin studies.

### 4. Crucial Nuances: The Environment's Role

A high heritability estimate does not diminish the importance of the environment. The relationship is not one of nature *versus* nurture, but of nature *and* nurture in a complex, interactive dance.

*   **The Flynn Effect:** Average IQ scores rose steadily throughout the 20th century across the globe—a phenomenon known as the Flynn effect. This rise of about 3 IQ points per decade is too rapid to be explained by genetics and is clear proof of the powerful influence of environmental factors, such as improved nutrition, more widespread and complex education, and a more stimulating and abstract world.
*   **Gene-Environment Interaction:** Heritability depends on the environment. In more equitable societies where everyone has access to good nutrition and education, the role of environmental differences in explaining IQ variance decreases, and thus genetic differences become more apparent (heritability is higher). Conversely, in populations with extreme environmental deprivation (e.g., poverty, malnutrition), environmental factors account for more of the variance, and heritability is lower. This is known as the **Scarr-Rowe hypothesis**: the potential of genes can only be fully expressed in a supportive environment.
*   **Genes Are Not Destiny:** High heritability does not imply determinism. Environmental interventions, especially in early childhood, can have a significant and lasting impact on cognitive development. Access to quality preschool, a stable home life, and proper nutrition are all critically important.

### Conclusion

In summary, the scientific consensus is that **intelligence, as measured by IQ tests, is substantially heritable**. The heritability estimate is not a single number but a range that increases with age, from around 40% in childhood to as high as 80% in late adulthood. This is largely because people increasingly select environments that match their genetic leanings as they grow older.

However, this high heritability does not mean that environment is unimportant. The expression of genetic potential is fundamentally dependent on environmental factors, from nutrition and education to the overall socioeconomic context. Intelligence is the product of a continuous and intricate interplay between a large number of genes and a lifetime of experiences.
