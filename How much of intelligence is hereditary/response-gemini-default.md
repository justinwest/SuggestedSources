# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

The question of how much intelligence is hereditary is one of the most studied and debated topics in psychology and behavioral genetics. The scientific consensus is that intelligence, as measured by psychometric tests (like IQ tests), is substantially heritable, but it is not determined by genetics alone. The answer is a complex interplay of "nature and nurture," where genes and environment continuously interact throughout a person's life.

### 1. Heritability Estimates and the Influence of Age

Heritability is a statistical concept that estimates how much of the variation in a trait *within a population* can be attributed to genetic differences among individuals. It is crucial to understand that heritability does not apply to a single individual; you cannot say that 50% of your personal IQ comes from your genes.

Scientific consensus, based on decades of research, places the heritability of intelligence (often referred to as the 'g' factor or general cognitive ability) in a range of **40% to 80%** [1, 2]. A key finding is that this heritability is not static and changes significantly with age:

*   **In early childhood**, heritability is lower, around **20-40%**. At this stage, the shared family environment (parenting, home resources) has a stronger influence on IQ variation.
*   **In adolescence**, heritability increases to around **60%**.
*   **In adulthood**, heritability reaches its peak, often estimated as high as **80%** [1].

This counter-intuitive increase is a central discovery. It suggests that as people age, they gain more autonomy to select, modify, and create environments that align with their genetic predispositions. This phenomenon is known as active gene-environment correlation, or "niche-picking" [1]. For example, a person with a genetic predisposition for high cognitive ability might actively seek out higher education, intellectually demanding jobs, and complex hobbies, thereby amplifying their initial genetic potential.

### 2. How Heritability Is Studied

These estimates are primarily derived from two types of studies:

*   **Twin and Adoption Studies:** These are the classical methods. By comparing identical twins (who share 100% of their genes) with fraternal twins (who share about 50% of their genes), researchers can infer the role of genetics. If identical twins are more similar in their IQ scores than fraternal twins, it points to a genetic influence. Adoption studies, which compare adopted children to their biological and adoptive parents, help disentangle genetic from environmental effects [2].
*   **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS):** This modern molecular genetics approach scans the entire genomes of thousands of individuals to find specific genetic variants (called SNPs) associated with a trait. GWAS studies have confirmed that intelligence is highly **polygenic**, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genes, each with a very small effect. No single "intelligence gene" exists [6].

### 3. The Critical Role of the Environment

A heritability estimate of 50% also implies that 50% of the variation is due to environmental factors. The environment is not just a secondary factor; it is essential for genetic potential to be realized. Key environmental influences include:

*   **Socioeconomic Status (SES):** The environment's impact is not uniform across all social strata. Research by Eric Turkheimer has shown that in families with low SES, the heritability of IQ is significantly lower (sometimes close to zero), while the influence of the shared family environment is much higher. In affluent families, the opposite is true: heritability is high. This suggests that a certain baseline of resources (good nutrition, safety, stable schooling) is necessary for genetic potential to fully express itself. In impoverished or chaotic environments, environmental factors can suppress genetic potential [4].
*   **The Flynn Effect:** This refers to the substantial and long-sustained increase in fluid and crystallized intelligence test scores measured in many parts of the world from the 1930s to the present day. The average IQ score has been rising by about three points per decade. This rapid change cannot be genetic, as the human gene pool does not change that quickly. It is considered powerful evidence for the strong influence of environmental factors, such as improved nutrition, increased years of formal education, and a more complex, stimulating modern world that requires more abstract thought [5].
*   **Education and Nutrition:** Access to quality education is directly linked to higher IQ scores. Schooling teaches not just facts but also problem-solving skills and abstract thinking that are measured on IQ tests. Likewise, severe malnutrition, especially in early childhood, can demonstrably impair cognitive development [3].

### 4. The Modern View: Gene-Environment Interaction (GxE)

The "nature versus nurture" debate is now considered obsolete. The modern understanding is one of **"nature and nurture,"** emphasizing their complex interplay. Genes do not operate in a vacuum.

*   **Gene-Environment Correlation (rGE):** This is the idea that our genes influence the environments we experience. The "niche-picking" described earlier is a form of active rGE. There is also passive rGE (e.g., smart parents pass on genes *and* provide a book-filled home) and evocative rGE (e.g., a genetically curious child asks more questions, evoking more stimulating responses from adults) [1].
*   **Gene-Environment Interaction (GxE):** This means that genes can have different effects depending on the environment. The finding that IQ heritability is higher in high-SES families is a classic example of GxE. The same genetic potential can lead to different outcomes depending on the environmental opportunities or constraints a person faces [4].

### Conclusion

In summary, intelligence is one of the most heritable psychological traits. Genetics provides a potential or a predisposition, but it is not deterministic. While estimates suggest that genetics accounts for a large portion of the *variation* in IQ scores within a population, especially in adulthood, environmental factors are absolutely critical. They determine whether genetic potential is realized, suppressed, or amplified. The most accurate answer is that intelligence emerges from a lifelong, dynamic dance between a complex set of genetic influences and an equally complex set of environmental factors.
