# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

The question of how much intelligence is hereditary is one of the most studied and debated topics in psychology and behavioral genetics. The scientific consensus is that intelligence is significantly heritable, but the relationship is complex and heavily influenced by environmental factors. There is no single percentage that applies to every individual or every population.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the key findings and nuances.

### 1. The Core Concept: Heritability

First, it is crucial to understand what "heritability" means in a scientific context.

*   **What Heritability Is:** Heritability is a statistical estimate of the proportion of **variation** in a trait (like intelligence) within a specific **population** that can be attributed to genetic differences among individuals in that population.
*   **What Heritability Is Not:** It is **not** a measure of how much of a single individual's intelligence is determined by their genes. You cannot say, "My IQ is 120, and 60% of that is from my genes." It is a population-level statistic. Heritability is also not fixed; it can change depending on the population and the environment being studied.

### 2. The Scientific Consensus and Evidence

Decades of research, primarily from twin studies, adoption studies, and more recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have led to a general consensus.

**The headline finding is that the heritability of intelligence is substantial, typically estimated to be between 50% and 80% in adulthood in developed countries.**

This figure is not static and changes significantly throughout a person's life.

*   **In Early Childhood:** Heritability is lower, around 20-40%. At this stage, the shared family environment (e.g., parents' educational level, home resources) has a stronger influence.
*   **In Adolescence:** Heritability increases to around 60%.
*   **In Adulthood:** Heritability reaches its peak, often cited as high as 80%.

#### Sources of Evidence:

*   **Twin Studies:** These are the classic foundation of heritability research. By comparing identical (monozygotic) twins, who share 100% of their genes, to fraternal (dizygotic) twins, who share about 50% of their genes, researchers can infer genetic influence. The fact that identical twins have far more similar IQ scores than fraternal twins, even when raised in different homes, is powerful evidence for a strong genetic component.
*   **Adoption Studies:** These studies compare adopted children to both their biological parents (shared genes, different environment) and their adoptive parents (shared environment, different genes). Children's IQ scores consistently correlate more strongly with their biological parents' IQs than with their adoptive parents' IQs, reinforcing the role of genetics.
*   **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS):** Modern genetic research attempts to identify specific genetic variants (SNPs) associated with intelligence. These studies have confirmed that intelligence is highly **polygenic**, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genes, each having a very small effect. No single "intelligence gene" exists. While GWAS has successfully identified many associated genetic variants, they currently only account for a fraction of the heritability estimated from twin studies, a phenomenon known as the "missing heritability" problem.

### 3. Key Nuances and Complexities

A high heritability estimate does not mean that the environment is unimportant. The relationship is a dynamic interplay.

#### The Increasing Heritability with Age
The fact that heritability *increases* with age is a crucial and somewhat counterintuitive finding. This is largely explained by **gene-environment correlation (rGE)**, specifically "niche-picking." As individuals grow older, they gain more autonomy to select, modify, and create environments that align with their genetic predispositions.

*   **Example:** A child with a genetic predisposition for high verbal ability may actively seek out books, enjoy school more, and choose friends who are also intellectually curious. This environment then further enhances their verbal skills. In this way, their genes influence the environment they experience, amplifying the initial genetic effect over time.

#### The Role of the Environment
The environment is a critical factor that determines how genetic potential is expressed.

*   **The Flynn Effect:** This refers to the substantial and long-sustained increase in intelligence test scores measured in many parts of the world from the 1930s to the present day. This rapid rise in population-level IQ cannot be explained by genetics, which changes far too slowly. It is clear evidence of powerful environmental factors, such as improved nutrition, better education, and increased societal complexity.
*   **Socioeconomic Status (SES):** The heritability of intelligence can vary significantly by SES. In lower-SES populations, environmental factors (e.g., poor nutrition, stress, lack of educational resources) can suppress the expression of genetic potential. In these deprived environments, environmental differences account for more of the variation in IQ, and heritability is lower. Conversely, in affluent environments where basic needs are met and opportunities are abundant, genetic differences have more room to emerge, and heritability is higher.

#### Gene-Environment Interaction (GxE)
This concept describes how the effect of a gene may depend on a specific environment, and vice-versa. High heritability does not imply that intelligence is immutable. Environmental interventions, especially early in life, can have a profound impact. For example, high-quality early childhood education can provide significant boosts to cognitive development, particularly for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.

### Conclusion

To summarize, the answer to "How much of intelligence is hereditary?" is nuanced:

1.  **Genetics are a major factor:** In developed nations, genetic differences among people account for a large proportion—typically **50% to 80% in adulthood**—of the *variation* in intelligence scores within the population.
2.  **It is not genetic determinism:** High heritability does not mean intelligence is fixed at birth. It describes population variance, not an individual's destiny.
3.  **Heritability changes with age:** The influence of genetics on intelligence becomes more prominent as a person gets older, largely due to individuals shaping their own environments to match their genetic tendencies.
4.  **The environment is critically important:** Factors like nutrition, education, and socioeconomic status have a powerful effect on intelligence. The environment can either suppress or unlock an individual's genetic potential.

Ultimately, intelligence emerges from a complex, continuous interplay between a large number of genes and a vast array of environmental factors throughout a person's life. The "nature vs. nurture" debate is widely considered obsolete; modern science shows it is always a combination of nature *and* nurture.
