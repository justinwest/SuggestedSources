# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

The question of how much intelligence is hereditary is one of the most studied and debated topics in psychology and genetics. The scientific consensus is that intelligence, as measured by cognitive ability or IQ tests, is significantly influenced by genetic factors, but it is not determined by them. The answer is not a single, simple number but a complex interplay between genes and the environment.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the current scientific understanding.

### 1. The Concept of Heritability

First, it is crucial to understand what "heritability" means in a scientific context.

*   **A Population Statistic:** Heritability is an estimate of how much of the *variation* in a trait (like intelligence) *within a specific population* can be attributed to genetic differences among individuals in that population.
*   **What It Is Not:** Heritability does not tell us what percentage of a *single individual's* intelligence is genetic. It is impossible to disentangle the contributions of genes and environment in one person, just as it's impossible to say a cake's height is 60% due to flour and 40% due to the oven's heat. Both are 100% necessary.
*   **Not Fixed:** Heritability estimates are not universal or unchanging. They can differ across populations, age groups, and socioeconomic conditions.

### 2. The Scientific Consensus and Key Findings

Decades of research, primarily from twin and adoption studies, have led to a broad consensus.

*   **Overall Estimate:** Most large-scale studies estimate the heritability of intelligence in adults to be between **50% and 80%**. This means that 50-80% of the observed differences in IQ scores among adults in the studied populations can be explained by their genetic differences.
*   **Heritability Increases with Age:** This is one of the most consistent and perhaps counterintuitive findings.
    *   **In early childhood,** heritability is lower, around **20-40%**. At this stage, the shared family environment (parenting, home resources) has a stronger influence on IQ differences.
    *   **In adolescence and adulthood,** heritability rises to **60-80%**. The influence of the shared family environment fades, while the impact of genetics becomes more pronounced.

The primary methods used to determine these figures include:

*   **Twin Studies:** By comparing identical (monozygotic) twins, who share 100% of their genes, to fraternal (dizygotic) twins, who share about 50% of their genes, researchers can estimate the influence of genetics. Identical twins consistently show much greater similarity in IQ scores than fraternal twins, pointing to a strong genetic component.
*   **Adoption Studies:** These studies compare the IQ of adopted children to both their biological parents (genetic influence) and their adoptive parents (environmental influence). Adopted children's IQs tend to correlate more strongly with their biological parents' IQs as they age.
*   **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS):** Modern genetic research has confirmed these findings. GWAS scan the entire genome to identify specific genetic variants (SNPs) associated with intelligence. These studies show that intelligence is highly **polygenic**, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genes, each with a very small effect. There is no single "intelligence gene."

### 3. The Crucial Role of the Environment

A heritability of 50-80% means that **20-50% of the variance in intelligence is attributable to environmental factors**. The environment is not just a secondary factor; it is essential for genetic potential to be expressed. Key environmental influences include:

*   **Socioeconomic Status (SES):** Access to quality nutrition, healthcare, a stable and stimulating home, and better schools has a significant impact. In environments of high deprivation, the heritability of intelligence is much lower because adverse conditions can suppress the expression of genetic potential.
*   **Education:** Schooling has a clear causal effect on raising IQ scores. Both the quality and duration of education are strongly linked to cognitive ability.
*   **Nutrition:** Severe malnutrition, especially early in life, can severely impair cognitive development. Deficiencies in substances like iodine and iron have been proven to lower population-level IQ.
*   **The Flynn Effect:** This refers to the observed substantial and long-sustained increase in IQ scores measured in many parts of the world from the 1930s to the present day. Since the gene pool could not have changed this rapidly, this phenomenon provides powerful evidence for the strong influence of environmental factors (e.g., better nutrition, more complex schooling, and a more stimulating world).

### 4. The Modern Synthesis: Gene-Environment Interaction (GxE)

The "nature versus nurture" debate is now considered outdated. The modern understanding is one of "nature *and* nurture" working together through constant interaction.

*   **Gene-Environment Correlation (rGE):** This is the idea that our genetic makeup influences the environments we experience.
    *   **Passive:** Children inherit genes from their parents and are also raised in an environment shaped by their parents' characteristics (e.g., parents with high IQs may pass on genes for intelligence *and* provide a home full of books and intellectual conversation).
    *   **Evocative:** A child's genetic predispositions can evoke certain responses from their environment (e.g., a curious, bright child may get more attention and encouragement from teachers).
    *   **Active:** As people get older, they actively select environments that match their genetic inclinations (a process called "niche-picking"). A person with a genetic predisposition for high intelligence might choose to read complex books, attend university, and associate with other intellectuals. This active selection is a key reason why heritability *increases* with age.

### Conclusion

In summary, the answer to "How much of intelligence is hereditary?" is nuanced and multifaceted:

1.  **Genetics are a major factor.** The heritability of intelligence is substantial, with estimates for adults typically ranging from 50% to 80%. This means a large portion of the differences in IQ scores between people in a population can be traced to their genetic differences.
2.  **It is not genetically determined.** A significant portion of the variance (20-50%) is due to environmental factors. Genes provide a potential or a predisposition, but the environment largely determines how that potential is realized.
3.  **The relationship is dynamic.** The influence of genes increases with age as individuals gain more freedom to select environments that align with their genetic makeup.
4.  **There is no nature vs. nurture dichotomy.** Intelligence emerges from the complex, continuous interplay between thousands of genes and a multitude of environmental factors, from the prenatal period through a person's entire life.
