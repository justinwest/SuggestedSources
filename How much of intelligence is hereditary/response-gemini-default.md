# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Excellent question. The relationship between genetics and intelligence is one of the most studied, yet most controversial, topics in psychology and behavioral genetics. The answer is not a simple percentage but a complex interplay of factors.

Here is a comprehensive, accurate, and well-structured response.

### Executive Summary

A substantial portion of the variation in intelligence among individuals in a population can be attributed to genetic factors. The most commonly cited figure for the **heritability of intelligence is approximately 50%**, but this is a rough average. The true picture is far more nuanced:

*   **Heritability is not a fixed number.** It changes significantly over a person's lifespan.
*   **It is a population statistic**, not a measure of how much of one person's intelligence is genetic.
*   Genes and environment are not separate forces; they are in a **continuous, dynamic interplay**.

### 1. Defining the Key Terms

To understand the science, we must first be precise with our language.

*   **Intelligence:** In this context, intelligence does not refer to creativity, wisdom, or emotional intelligence. It refers to the psychometric concept of **general cognitive ability (or the *g* factor)**. This is the underlying ability that a wide range of cognitive tasks (e.g., reasoning, problem-solving, abstract thinking, learning) have in common. It is most often measured using standardized IQ (Intelligence Quotient) tests.

*   **Heritability (H²):** This is the most misunderstood term.
    *   **What it IS:** Heritability is a statistical estimate that describes how much of the *variation* in a specific trait (like intelligence) *within a given population* can be attributed to genetic differences *among the individuals in that population*.
    *   **What it is NOT:**
        *   It does **not** mean that 50% of an *individual's* IQ comes from their genes.
        *   It does **not** mean a trait is unchangeable or deterministic. A highly heritable trait can still be strongly influenced by the environment. (e.g., Height is ~80% heritable, yet average height has increased dramatically over the last century due to better nutrition).

### 2. The Primary Evidence: Behavioral Genetics

Our understanding of intelligence heritability comes primarily from decades of behavioral genetics research, mainly using two types of studies.

#### A. Twin Studies
This is the cornerstone of heritability research. The logic is as follows:
*   **Identical (monozygotic) twins** share 100% of their genes.
*   **Fraternal (dizygotic) twins** share, on average, 50% of their genes, just like regular siblings.

By comparing the similarity of IQ scores between these two groups, researchers can estimate the influence of genetics. If identical twins are significantly more similar in IQ than fraternal twins, it points to a strong genetic influence.

*   **Key Finding:** Across numerous studies, the IQ correlation for identical twins is very high (around +0.85), while for fraternal twins it is much lower (around +0.60). Studies of **identical twins reared apart** are particularly powerful, as they separate genes from a shared family environment. These twins still show a remarkably high IQ correlation (around +0.75), providing strong evidence for genetic influence.

#### B. Adoption Studies
These studies compare adopted children to both their biological parents (shared genes, different environment) and their adoptive parents (shared environment, different genes).

*   **Key Finding:** The IQs of adopted children consistently show a stronger correlation with their biological parents than with their adoptive parents, and this correlation strengthens as the children age.

### 3. Key Findings and Nuances

The research has revealed several critical complexities that go beyond a single number.

#### Finding 1: Heritability Increases with Age
This is perhaps the most fascinating and counter-intuitive finding.
*   **In infancy and early childhood**, the heritability of IQ is relatively low, around **20-30%**. The shared family environment is a dominant factor.
*   **In adolescence**, heritability rises to around **50-60%**.
*   **In adulthood**, heritability stabilizes at a high level, often estimated to be **70-80%**.

**Why does this happen?** This is likely due to **gene-environment correlation (rGE)**. As people get older, they gain more autonomy to select, modify, and create environments that are compatible with their genetic predispositions. For example, a child with a genetic predisposition for high verbal ability will likely seek out books, enjoy school, and pursue intellectually stimulating hobbies and careers as an adult, thereby amplifying their initial genetic advantage.

#### Finding 2: Gene-Environment Interaction (GxE)
Genes do not operate in a vacuum. The environment can regulate how genes are expressed.
*   **The Role of Socioeconomic Status (SES):** In low-SES environments characterized by deprivation, poverty, and poor nutrition, the environmental factors can be so overwhelming that they suppress the expression of an individual's genetic potential. In these groups, heritability is lower because the environment is the primary driver of variation.
*   Conversely, in affluent, high-opportunity environments, basic needs are met, allowing individual genetic differences to flourish and become a more significant source of variation. In these groups, heritability is higher.

#### Finding 3: The Flynn Effect
The Flynn Effect is the massive, long-term increase in IQ scores observed throughout the 20th century in countries all over the world. Average scores rose by about 3 points per decade. Since the human gene pool could not have changed that rapidly, this effect is considered clear proof of the powerful influence of **environmental factors**, such as:
*   Improved nutrition and healthcare.
*   Longer and more abstract schooling.
*   A more cognitively demanding and complex world (e.g., technology).

### 4. The Search for "Intelligence Genes": Molecular Genetics

With advances in genomics, scientists are no longer just estimating heritability; they are trying to identify the specific genes involved.

*   **Highly Polygenic:** There is no single "gene for intelligence." Intelligence is a **highly polygenic** trait, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genes, each with a very small effect.
*   **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS):** These massive studies scan the genomes of hundreds of thousands of people. They have successfully identified thousands of genetic variants (SNPs) associated with educational attainment and cognitive function.
*   **Polygenic Scores (PGS):** By adding up the tiny effects of all these variants, researchers can create a Polygenic Score. Currently, these scores can predict about 10-15% of the variance in intelligence—a figure that is steadily increasing as research methods improve.

### 5. Conclusion: A Lifelong Dance

So, how much of intelligence is hereditary?

The most accurate answer is that **genetics provides a significant potential, but the environment profoundly shapes how much of that potential is realized.**

*   The 50% figure is a useful, but overly simple, population average.
*   Heritability is not destiny. It is a dynamic value that increases over our lifespan as we actively shape our own environments based on our genetic tendencies.
*   The environment acts as both a **suppressor** (in cases of deprivation) and an **enabler** (in cases of opportunity) of genetic potential.

Ultimately, intelligence emerges from an intricate, lifelong dance between our genes and our experiences. Nature and nurture are not opposing forces; they are inextricably intertwined partners.
