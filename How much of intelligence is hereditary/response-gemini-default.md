# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

The question of how much of intelligence is hereditary is one of the most studied and debated topics in behavioral genetics. The scientific consensus is that intelligence is a complex trait influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and their intricate interplay. There is no single, simple answer, but a wealth of research provides a clear framework for understanding this relationship.

### 1. The Core Concept: Heritability

To understand the role of genetics, it is crucial to first define **heritability**.

*   **What it is:** Heritability is a statistical measure that estimates the proportion of **variation** in a trait (like measured intelligence) within a specific **population** that can be attributed to genetic differences among individuals in that population.
*   **What it is NOT:**
    *   It is **not** a measure of how much of an *individual's* intelligence is determined by their genes. You cannot say "my IQ is 50% genetic."
    *   It does **not** mean that intelligence is fixed or unchangeable. A highly heritable trait can still be significantly influenced by the environment. For example, height is highly heritable (~80%), but average height has increased dramatically over the last century due to better nutrition.
    *   It is **population-specific**. A heritability estimate of 50% in one population (e.g., middle-class Americans) may not apply to another population with a very different range of environments (e.g., individuals in a region with widespread malnutrition).

### 2. The Scientific Consensus: A Shifting Number

Decades of research, primarily from twin and adoption studies, have led to a general consensus on the heritability of intelligence, as measured by IQ tests.

The most striking finding is that **the heritability of intelligence increases with age**.

*   **In early childhood:** Heritability is relatively low, estimated at around **20% to 40%**. At this stage, the shared family environment (parenting style, home resources) has a more dominant influence on the variation in IQ scores.
*   **In adolescence and young adulthood:** Heritability increases to approximately **50% to 60%**.
*   **In later adulthood:** Heritability can be as high as **80%**.

This surprising increase is explained by a concept called **gene-environment correlation (rGE)**. As people age, they gain more autonomy to select, modify, and create their own environments. Individuals with a genetic predisposition for higher cognitive ability may actively seek out more intellectually stimulating environments—they choose to read more, pursue higher education, and engage in complex hobbies. This process, known as "niche-picking," allows their genetic predispositions to be more fully expressed over their lifespan, thus increasing the heritability estimate.

### 3. How This Is Studied

Scientists use several methods to disentangle the effects of genes and environment:

*   **Twin Studies:** These are the cornerstone of heritability research. By comparing identical (monozygotic) twins, who share 100% of their genes, to fraternal (dizygotic) twins, who share on average 50% of their genes, researchers can estimate the influence of genetics. If identical twins are significantly more similar in their IQ scores than fraternal twins, it points to a strong genetic component.
*   **Adoption Studies:** These studies compare adopted children to both their biological parents (shared genes, different environment) and their adoptive parents (shared environment, different genes). The extent to which children's IQs resemble their biological parents' IQs provides a powerful measure of genetic influence.
*   **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS):** Modern genetic research has moved beyond estimating heritability to identifying specific genes. GWAS scan the entire genomes of thousands of individuals to find tiny genetic variations (called SNPs) associated with intelligence. These studies have confirmed that intelligence is a **polygenic** trait, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genes, each having a very small effect. There is no single "intelligence gene."

### 4. The Crucial Role of the Environment

While genetics plays a significant role, the environment is critically important in determining where an individual's intelligence falls within their genetic potential.

*   **The Flynn Effect:** This refers to the substantial and long-sustained increase in both fluid and crystallized intelligence test scores measured in many parts of the world from the 1930s to the present day. This rise—equivalent to about 3 IQ points per decade—is far too rapid to be explained by genetic changes and is considered powerful evidence for the impact of environmental factors, such as improved nutrition, more widespread and better-quality education, and increased environmental complexity.
*   **Socioeconomic Status (SES):** The environment's impact is most pronounced in conditions of deprivation. In low-SES environments, factors like poor nutrition, exposure to toxins (e.g., lead), and lack of access to quality schooling can suppress cognitive development. In these situations, the environment accounts for more of the variation in IQ, and heritability is lower. Conversely, in affluent environments where basic needs are met and educational opportunities are abundant, genetic differences have more room to emerge, and heritability is higher.
*   **Specific Environmental Factors:** Numerous factors are known to influence cognitive development, including:
    *   **Nutrition:** Especially in early childhood.
    *   **Education:** Both the quantity and quality of schooling.
    *   **Family and Home Environment:** Parental interaction and cognitive stimulation.
    *   **Health and Healthcare:** Access to prenatal care and freedom from disease.

### Conclusion

In summary, the question of "how much" of intelligence is hereditary is best answered with a nuanced, evidence-based perspective:

**Intelligence is substantially heritable, but it is not genetically determined.** The heritability of IQ is not a fixed number; it increases with age, from about 20% in infancy to as high as 80% in later adulthood. This reflects a dynamic process where individuals' genetic predispositions lead them to shape environments that, in turn, amplify those predispositions.

Ultimately, intelligence emerges from a complex and continuous interplay between genes and the environment. Genes may provide a blueprint for a person's cognitive potential, but the environment—encompassing everything from nutrition and education to socioeconomic status—largely determines how that blueprint is built and realized throughout a person's life.
