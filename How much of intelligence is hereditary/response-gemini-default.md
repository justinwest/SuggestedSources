# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

The question of how much of intelligence is hereditary is one of the most studied and debated topics in psychology and genetics. The scientific consensus is that intelligence is substantially heritable, but the exact figure is complex and depends on several factors. It is crucial to understand that genetics and environment are not opposing forces but are in a constant, dynamic interplay.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the current scientific understanding.

### 1. Defining "Intelligence" and "Heritability"

Before discussing the numbers, it's essential to define the key terms, as they are often misunderstood.

*   **Intelligence:** In the context of this research, "intelligence" almost always refers to what is measured by standardized intelligence quotient (IQ) tests. These tests are designed to assess a range of cognitive abilities, such as reasoning, problem-solving, spatial visualization, and memory. The strong positive correlations among these different abilities have led to the concept of the **general intelligence factor (g-factor)**, which is often considered the underlying variable that heritability studies investigate.
*   **Heritability:** This is the most misunderstood term. Heritability is a statistical concept that estimates the proportion of **variation** in a trait (like intelligence) within a specific **population** that can be attributed to genetic differences among individuals in that population.

    *   **It is a population statistic, not an individual one.** A heritability of 60% does not mean that 60% of *your* intelligence comes from your genes and 40% from your environment. It means that 60% of the observed differences in IQ scores among people in the studied population can be explained by their genetic differences.
    *   **It is not fixed.** Heritability can change depending on the population being studied and the environment they live in.

### 2. The Core Finding: How Much is Heritable?

Decades of research, primarily using twin studies and adoption studies, have produced a remarkably consistent range for the heritability of intelligence.

The most widely accepted estimate for the heritability of the g-factor is between **50% and 80%** in adulthood. However, this single figure hides crucial nuances.

### 3. Key Factors That Influence Heritability Estimates

The reason for the wide range (50-80%) is that heritability is not a universal constant. It is influenced by several key factors:

**A. Age:**
This is one of the most striking findings in the field. The heritability of intelligence **increases with age**.

*   **Infancy:** Heritability is low, around 20%.
*   **Childhood:** It rises to about 40%.
*   **Adolescence and Adulthood:** It stabilizes at a high level, typically between 60% and 80%.

This seems counterintuitive; one might expect environmental influences to accumulate over time. The leading explanation is **gene-environment correlation (or "niche-picking")**. As people get older, they gain more autonomy to select, modify, and create environments that align with their genetic predispositions. For example, a child with a genetic predisposition for high academic ability may choose to read more books, take challenging courses, and associate with intellectually curious peers, thereby amplifying their initial genetic potential.

**B. Socioeconomic Status (SES):**
The environment can either suppress or enable the expression of genetic potential. In environments of deprivation (low SES), environmental factors have a much larger impact on IQ variation, and genetic factors have less.

*   In **low-SES populations**, heritability estimates for intelligence are significantly lower, sometimes as low as 20-40%. Factors like poor nutrition, stress, and lack of access to quality education can suppress the expression of a child's genetic potential for intelligence.
*   In **high-SES populations**, where children have access to good nutrition, stable homes, and high-quality education, environmental conditions are more optimal and uniform. In this context, the remaining differences between individuals are more likely to be due to their genetic differences, leading to higher heritability estimates (60% or more). This phenomenon is known as the **Wilson Effect**.

### 4. The Role of the Environment

Even with high heritability estimates, the environment remains critically important. Genetic heritability does not imply that intelligence is unchangeable.

*   **The Flynn Effect:** This refers to the substantial and long-sustained increase in both fluid and crystallized intelligence test scores measured in many parts of the world from the 1930s to the present day. The rate of increase is too fast to be explained by genetics, pointing strongly to environmental factors such as improved nutrition, more and better schooling, and increased environmental complexity.
*   **Specific Environmental Factors:** Numerous non-genetic factors are proven to influence cognitive development, including:
    *   **Nutrition:** Prenatal nutrition and avoiding nutrient deficiencies (e.g., iodine, iron) are crucial.
    *   **Education:** The quality and duration of schooling have a direct causal impact on IQ scores.
    *   **Family Environment:** A stable, stimulating, and supportive home environment fosters cognitive growth.
    *   **Exposure to Toxins:** Prenatal exposure to substances like lead or alcohol can have a significant negative impact.

### 5. Modern Genetic Research: Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)

While twin studies estimate overall heritability, modern genetics seeks to identify the specific genes involved.

*   **Polygenic Trait:** Intelligence is a **highly polygenic** trait, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genes, each with a very small effect. There is no single "intelligence gene."
*   **The "Missing Heritability" Problem:** Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have successfully identified hundreds of genetic variants associated with educational attainment and cognitive function. However, all these identified genes, when added together, currently explain only a fraction (perhaps 10-20%) of the heritability estimated by twin studies (50-80%). This gap is known as the "missing heritability" problem, and it remains an active area of research.

### Summary and Conclusion

To answer the question "How much of intelligence is hereditary?":

1.  **Substantial Influence:** Genetics exerts a substantial influence on the differences in intelligence among individuals, with heritability estimates for adults in developed countries typically ranging from **50% to 80%**.

2.  **Not a Fixed Number:** This figure is not a law of nature. Heritability is lower in children and increases with age. It is also highly dependent on the environment, with heritability being significantly lower in deprived environments and higher in enriched ones.

3.  **It's an Interaction, Not a Battle:** The most accurate model is not "nature vs. nurture" but **"nature via nurture."** Genes are not a blueprint that is mechanically executed. They are a set of predispositions that interact continuously with the environment. An individual's genetic potential is realized, amplified, or suppressed by their life experiences, education, and social context.

In essence, genes may provide a rough draft for an individual's cognitive potential, but the environment does a significant amount of the writing and editing.
