# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

The question of how much intelligence is hereditary is one of the most studied and debated topics in psychology and genetics. The scientific consensus is that intelligence, like virtually all complex human traits, is the result of a dynamic and intricate interplay between genetic predispositions and environmental factors. There is no simple percentage that applies to every individual, but research provides a statistical estimate for populations.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the current scientific understanding.

### 1. The Key Concept: Heritability

Before discussing the numbers, it's crucial to understand what "heritability" means in a scientific context.

*   **Heritability (h²)** is a statistical concept that estimates the proportion of **variation** in a trait (like intelligence) within a specific population that can be attributed to **genetic differences** among individuals in that population.
*   **What it is NOT:** Heritability does not tell us what percentage of a single individual's intelligence is genetic. It is a population-level statistic, not an individual one. For an individual, genes and environment are 100% intertwined and inseparable. You cannot have intelligence without both the genetic blueprint and the environmental resources to build it. The question is about what explains the *differences* we see between people.

An analogy helps: The heritability of "having two hands" in the human population is nearly 0%. This isn't because genes aren't essential for developing hands; they are. It's because the variation in the number of hands people have is almost entirely due to environmental factors (like accidents or birth defects), not genetic differences.

### 2. The Scientific Evidence and a Shifting Number

Decades of research, primarily using twin, adoption, and family studies, have converged on a general estimate. More recently, genomic studies have begun to identify specific genes involved.

*   **Twin Studies:** These studies are the cornerstone of behavioral genetics. By comparing identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins, who share 100% of their genes, to fraternal (dizygotic, DZ) twins, who share on average 50% of their genes, researchers can infer the influence of genetics. If identical twins are significantly more similar in IQ than fraternal twins, it points to a strong genetic contribution.
*   **Adoption Studies:** These studies compare the IQ of adopted children to both their biological parents (shared genes, different environment) and their adoptive parents (shared environment, different genes). These studies consistently show that children's IQs correlate more strongly with their biological parents' IQs.
*   **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS):** These modern studies scan the entire genomes of thousands of people to find specific genetic variants (SNPs) associated with intelligence. They have confirmed that intelligence is highly **polygenic**, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genes, each with a very small effect. There is no single "intelligence gene."

### 3. The Heritability Estimate: It Changes with Age

The most striking and consistent finding is that the heritability of intelligence is not static; it increases significantly over a person's lifespan.

*   **Early Childhood:** In infancy and early childhood, heritability is relatively low, around **20-40%**. At this stage, the shared family environment (parental income, nutrition, home learning environment) has a more dominant influence on IQ variation.
*   **Adolescence:** The heritability estimate rises to around **40-60%**.
*   **Adulthood:** In adulthood, heritability reaches its peak, with most studies placing it between **60% and 80%**.

**Why does heritability increase with age?**
This counterintuitive finding is best explained by the concept of **gene-environment correlation (rGE)**. As people get older, they gain more independence and actively select, modify, and create environments that match their genetic predispositions.

*   A child with a genetic predisposition for high cognitive ability might actively seek out challenging books, enjoy complex puzzles, and pursue higher education.
*   This "niche-picking" amplifies the initial genetic tendencies. The genes are driving the person to seek out an environment that, in turn, enhances the expression of those genes. In childhood, the environment is largely imposed by parents, but in adulthood, it is increasingly self-selected.

### 4. The Crucial Role of the Environment

While heritability is high, it does not mean the environment is unimportant. It accounts for the remaining variance and is essential for genetic potential to be realized.

*   **The Flynn Effect:** This refers to the substantial and long-sustained increase in both fluid and crystallized intelligence test scores measured in many parts of the world from the 1930s to the present day. This rise—equivalent to about 3 IQ points per decade—is too fast to be genetic. It is considered powerful evidence of the environment's impact, likely due to factors like improved nutrition, more and better schooling, and increased exposure to complex problem-solving in daily life.
*   **Socioeconomic Status (SES):** In environments of poverty and deprivation, the heritability of intelligence is significantly lower. This is because adverse environmental conditions (poor nutrition, stress, lack of educational resources) can suppress the expression of genetic potential. In more affluent environments, where basic needs are met, genetic differences have more opportunity to emerge, and heritability is higher.
*   **Specific Factors:** Key environmental variables include nutrition (especially early in life), quality and duration of education, cognitive stimulation from parents, and exposure to toxins like lead.

### 5. The Interplay: Genes and Environment Work Together

The "nature vs. nurture" framing is obsolete. The modern understanding is one of "nature *and* nurture" interacting in complex ways.

*   **Gene-Environment Interaction (GxE):** Genes and environment can have a multiplicative effect. A genetic predisposition for a certain ability may only manifest in a supportive environment. For example, a person with genes associated with musical talent will only develop that talent if they have access to musical instruments and instruction.
*   **Gene-Environment Correlation (rGE):** As mentioned above, our genes influence the environments we experience. This happens in three ways:
    1.  **Passive:** Parents provide both genes and an environment (e.g., highly verbal parents pass on genes for verbal ability and also create a word-rich home).
    2.  **Evocative:** An individual's genetic traits elicit certain responses from the environment (e.g., a curious child asks more questions and gets more detailed answers from adults).
    3.  **Active:** Individuals actively seek out environments that fit their genetic makeup ("niche-picking").

### Conclusion

To summarize, here are the key takeaways:

1.  **Significant Genetic Influence:** There is overwhelming evidence that genetic differences between people account for a substantial portion of the variance in intelligence scores.
2.  **Heritability is a Population Statistic:** The overall heritability of IQ in developed nations is often cited in the range of **50% to 80%**, depending on the age of the population studied. This figure does not apply to any single individual.
3.  **Heritability Increases with Age:** The influence of genetics on explaining IQ differences becomes more pronounced as individuals move from childhood into adulthood, largely due to their increasing ability to select their own environments.
4.  **Environment is Absolutely Critical:** Genetics provides a potential, but the environment determines how much of that potential is realized. Factors like education, nutrition, and socioeconomic stability have a profound impact. The Flynn Effect is a testament to the power of the environment.
5.  **It's a Complex Interaction:** Intelligence is the product of a continuous, dynamic interplay between thousands of genes and a lifetime of environmental inputs. Genes and environment are not separate ingredients in a recipe; they are woven together from conception to death.
