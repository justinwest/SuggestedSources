Intelligence is a complex trait often measured through proxies like IQ tests, which assess cognitive abilities such as reasoning, problem-solving, and memory. The question of how much intelligence is hereditary refers to the concept of heritability—the proportion of variance in intelligence within a population that can be attributed to genetic differences among individuals. Importantly, heritability does not mean that a certain percentage of an individual's intelligence is "inherited" from parents; rather, it estimates the genetic contribution to differences between people in a specific environment [1]. Estimates of intelligence heritability typically range from 40% to 80%, depending on factors like age, socioeconomic status (SES), and the population studied. This response explores these estimates, the evidence from various studies, and the interplay between genetics and environment.

### Key Concepts in Heritability of Intelligence
Heritability is derived from studies comparing genetic relatedness and similarity in intelligence scores. For instance:
- **Twin studies**: Identical (monozygotic) twins, who share nearly 100% of their genes, show higher correlations in IQ (around 0.7-0.8) compared to fraternal (dizygotic) twins, who share about 50% (around 0.4-0.5). This suggests a strong genetic component [1].
- **Adoption studies**: Children adopted into different families resemble their biological parents more in IQ than their adoptive parents, further supporting heritability [2].
- **Family studies**: Siblings and parent-child correlations also contribute to estimates.

A meta-analysis of such studies indicates that heritability of general intelligence (often denoted as *g*) averages around 50% in adulthood, but it increases with age—from about 30% in childhood to 70-80% in later life. This "Wilson effect" may occur because genetic influences become more pronounced as individuals gain control over their environments [1][3].

However, heritability is not fixed. It can vary by context:
- In high-SES environments, heritability estimates are higher (up to 80%), as environmental advantages are more uniform, allowing genetic differences to stand out.
- In low-SES environments, heritability drops (as low as 10-20%), with environment explaining more variance, due to factors like poor nutrition or limited education [4].

### Genetic Mechanisms and Recent Advances
Intelligence is polygenic, meaning it involves thousands of small-effect genetic variants rather than a single "intelligence gene." Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of these variants, and polygenic scores derived from them can predict about 10-20% of the variance in intelligence in independent samples [5]. This is lower than overall heritability estimates, suggesting that much of the genetic influence remains "missing" due to rare variants, gene-environment interactions, or limitations in current methods [3].

Epigenetics and gene-environment interplay add complexity. For example, genes may influence how individuals respond to education or stress, amplifying or dampening environmental effects [2].

### The Role of Environment
Even with high heritability, environment plays a crucial role. Non-genetic factors account for the remaining variance (20-60%, depending on the estimate). These include prenatal nutrition, education quality, family environment, and cultural factors. Interventions like early childhood education can boost IQ by 5-10 points, demonstrating malleability [1]. The "Flynn effect"—a 20th-century rise in average IQ scores across generations—highlights environmental impacts, such as improved nutrition and schooling, rather than genetic changes [2].

Critically, heritability does not imply determinism. An individual with a genetic predisposition for high intelligence may underperform in a deprived environment, while supportive conditions can help those with average genetic endowments excel [4].

### Controversies and Limitations
The heritability of intelligence has been debated, partly due to historical misuse in eugenics or racial pseudoscience. Modern consensus, backed by behavioral genetics, rejects such notions, emphasizing that group differences (e.g., between ethnicities) are largely environmental and that within-group heritability does not explain between-group gaps [1][2]. Measurement issues also arise: IQ tests may not capture all aspects of intelligence (e.g., creativity or emotional intelligence), and cultural biases can affect scores [3].

In summary, while genetics contribute substantially to differences in intelligence—explaining roughly 50% of variance on average—the exact figure varies by context, and environment is equally vital. Ongoing research, including larger GWAS and longitudinal studies, continues to refine these estimates. Understanding this balance underscores the importance of equitable environments to maximize human potential.
