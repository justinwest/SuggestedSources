# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

The question of how much of intelligence is hereditary has been a central topic in psychology, genetics, and neuroscience for decades. Intelligence, often measured as IQ (intelligence quotient), is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Below, I provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the heritability of intelligence, supported by scientific research and expert consensus.

### Understanding Heritability of Intelligence
Heritability refers to the proportion of variance in a trait (like intelligence) within a population that can be attributed to genetic differences. It is not a measure of how much of an individual's intelligence is "caused" by genes, but rather how much of the variation in intelligence across a population is due to genetic factors. Heritability estimates for intelligence typically range from 50% to 80%, depending on age, population, and the methods used to measure it [1][2].

1. **Genetic Contributions**: Twin studies, adoption studies, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided strong evidence for the genetic basis of intelligence. Identical twins, who share nearly all their DNA, show much higher correlations in IQ (around 0.75-0.85) compared to fraternal twins, who share about 50% of their DNA (correlations around 0.5) [3]. This suggests that genetic similarity strongly predicts similarity in intelligence. Furthermore, GWAS have identified hundreds of genetic variants associated with intelligence, though each variant contributes only a tiny effect [4].
   
2. **Age and Heritability**: The heritability of intelligence increases with age. In childhood, environmental factors such as parenting, education, and socioeconomic status play a larger role, with heritability estimates around 20-40%. By adulthood, heritability rises to 60-80%, as individuals have more control over their environments and genetic predispositions become more pronounced [1][5]. This phenomenon is often explained by the concept of "gene-environment correlation," where individuals seek out environments that align with their genetic predispositions.

3. **Environmental Influences**: While genetics play a significant role, environmental factors are also crucial. Nutrition, access to education, socioeconomic status, and early childhood experiences can significantly impact cognitive development. For instance, studies of children adopted into higher socioeconomic environments show substantial IQ gains compared to peers who remain in disadvantaged settings [2]. However, these environmental effects tend to diminish over time as genetic influences become more dominant in adulthood.

4. **Limitations of Heritability Estimates**: Heritability is a population-specific statistic and does not imply that intelligence is fixed or unchangeable. It also does not account for gene-environment interactions, where genetic predispositions may be expressed differently depending on environmental conditions. For example, a child with a genetic potential for high intelligence may not reach that potential in a deprived environment [5].

5. **Ethical and Social Implications**: Discussions about the heritability of intelligence often raise ethical concerns, as they can be misused to justify inequality or discrimination. It is critical to emphasize that heritability does not equate to determinism, and environmental interventions can and do make a significant difference in cognitive outcomes [3].

### Conclusion
In summary, intelligence is substantially hereditary, with estimates suggesting that 50-80% of the variation in IQ within populations can be attributed to genetic factors, particularly in adulthood. However, environmental influences, especially in early life, play a critical role in shaping cognitive abilities. The interplay between genes and environment is complex, and ongoing research continues to refine our understanding of how these factors interact. It is also important to approach this topic with caution, recognizing the limitations of heritability estimates and the potential for misinterpretation.
