The heritability of intelligence is a complex topic that has been extensively studied through twin, adoption, and molecular genetic research. Current scientific evidence suggests that genetic factors account for approximately 50-80% of the variation in intelligence among individuals, though this estimate varies by age and methodology.

## Heritability Estimates Across Development

Research consistently shows that the heritability of intelligence changes across the lifespan. In early childhood, genetic factors account for about 20-40% of intelligence differences, but this proportion increases steadily with age [4]. By adolescence, heritability rises to approximately 50-60%, and in adulthood, it can reach 70-80% [4][7]. This phenomenon, known as the Wilson Effect, suggests that genetic influences on intelligence become more pronounced as individuals mature and have greater control over their environments.

A meta-analysis of longitudinal twin and adoption studies found that heritability increases from about 41% in childhood to 55% in adolescence and 66% in young adulthood [4]. This pattern has been replicated across multiple studies and populations, indicating a robust developmental trend.

## Molecular Genetic Evidence

Recent advances in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified specific genetic variants associated with intelligence. A large meta-analysis involving 269,867 individuals identified 205 independent genetic loci significantly associated with intelligence [3]. These studies have shown that intelligence is a highly polygenic trait, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genetic variants, each with small individual effects [2][7].

However, there remains a gap between heritability estimates from twin studies (50-80%) and the variance explained by identified genetic variants (currently about 10-20%) [5][6]. This "missing heritability" problem suggests that either many genetic variants with small effects remain undiscovered, or that other factors such as rare variants, gene-gene interactions, or epigenetic mechanisms play important roles.

## Within-Family Studies

Recent within-family studies, which compare siblings who share approximately 50% of their DNA, provide particularly robust evidence for genetic influences on intelligence. These studies help control for environmental factors that families share [8]. Polygenic scores (which aggregate the effects of many genetic variants) can predict intelligence differences even between siblings raised in the same household, though the effect sizes are smaller than in population-wide studies [8].

## Environmental Factors and Gene-Environment Interplay

While genetics plays a substantial role, environmental factors remain crucial for intellectual development. The remaining 20-50% of variance in intelligence is attributed to environmental influences, including education, nutrition, socioeconomic status, and early childhood experiences [1][2]. Importantly, genetic and environmental factors are not independent but interact in complex ways. For example, genetic predispositions may influence the environments individuals select or create for themselves, a phenomenon known as gene-environment correlation [7].

## Important Caveats

Several important limitations should be considered when interpreting heritability estimates:

1. **Population-specific**: Heritability estimates apply to populations, not individuals, and can vary across different populations and environments [1][5].

2. **Not fixed**: Heritability can change if environmental conditions change substantially. In more equitable environments with reduced environmental variation, heritability tends to be higher [2].

3. **Doesn't imply immutability**: High heritability does not mean intelligence cannot be influenced by interventions or environmental changes [1][6].

4. **Complex trait**: Intelligence is not determined by a single gene but involves thousands of genetic variants and their interactions with environmental factors [3][5].

## Conclusion

Current scientific evidence indicates that intelligence has a substantial genetic component, with heritability estimates ranging from 50-80% in adults. However, this does not diminish the importance of environmental factors, which account for 20-50% of the variation and interact with genetic factors in complex ways. The field continues to advance through large-scale genetic studies and sophisticated statistical methods, gradually uncovering the biological mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities while acknowledging the crucial role of environmental influences.
