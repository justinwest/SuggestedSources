# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

The heritability of intelligence is a complex topic that has been extensively studied through twin studies, adoption studies, and more recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Current research indicates that intelligence has substantial hereditary components, though the exact proportion varies depending on age, population, and measurement methods.

## Twin and Adoption Study Findings

Traditional behavioral genetic studies using twins and adoptees have consistently found that intelligence shows significant heritability. A comprehensive meta-analysis of longitudinal twin and adoption studies reveals that the heritability of cognitive ability increases substantially across development [4]. In childhood, heritability estimates are typically around 20-40%, but this increases to approximately 60-80% in adulthood [1][4]. This age-related increase in heritability is somewhat counterintuitive, as one might expect environmental factors to accumulate over time, but it appears that genetic influences become more pronounced as individuals age and gain more control over their environments.

## Molecular Genetic Evidence

Recent advances in molecular genetics have provided additional insights into the genetic basis of intelligence. Large-scale genome-wide association studies involving hundreds of thousands of participants have identified numerous genetic variants associated with cognitive ability [3]. A major GWAS meta-analysis of 269,867 individuals identified new genetic and functional links to intelligence, demonstrating that intelligence is a polygenic trait influenced by many genes of small effect [3].

The molecular genetic studies generally support the heritability estimates from twin studies, though they typically explain a smaller proportion of the variance initially—a phenomenon known as the "missing heritability" problem [2][7]. However, as sample sizes increase and methods improve, the proportion of intelligence variance explained by identified genetic variants continues to grow.

## Polygenic Score Predictions

Recent studies using polygenic scores—which combine information from many genetic variants—have shown increasing predictive power for intelligence and related traits [8]. These scores can predict cognitive abilities not only within families but also between siblings, providing additional evidence for the genetic basis of intelligence differences [8]. The predictive accuracy of these scores has improved substantially as the underlying GWAS studies have grown larger and more sophisticated.

## Environmental Interactions and Limitations

While the genetic contribution to intelligence is substantial, it's crucial to understand that heritability estimates do not mean that intelligence is predetermined or unchangeable [1][2]. Heritability describes the proportion of observed differences in a population that can be attributed to genetic differences, but this can vary significantly across different environments and populations. Environmental factors remain important, particularly in early development, and gene-environment interactions play a crucial role in shaping cognitive outcomes [5].

## Current Consensus

The current scientific consensus suggests that in developed Western populations, the heritability of intelligence is approximately 50-80% in adults, with the proportion increasing from childhood to adulthood [1][4][7]. However, these estimates should be interpreted cautiously, as they apply to population-level variance rather than individual determination, and they can vary significantly across different social and environmental contexts.

Recent meta-analyses examining the relationship between DNA variants and IQ have provided additional support for the genetic basis of intelligence while also highlighting the complexity of translating genetic findings into practical applications [6]. The field continues to evolve rapidly with new methodological approaches and larger datasets providing increasingly detailed insights into the genetic architecture of human intelligence.
