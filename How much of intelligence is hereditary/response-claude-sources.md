# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Intelligence shows substantial hereditary components, with research consistently demonstrating that genetic factors play a significant role in cognitive abilities. However, the extent of this heritability is complex and varies across development and environmental contexts.

## Heritability Estimates

Twin and adoption studies have provided the most robust estimates of intelligence heritability. Meta-analyses of longitudinal studies indicate that the heritability of cognitive ability increases with age, ranging from approximately 20% in infancy to 60-80% in adulthood [4]. This pattern suggests that genetic influences become more pronounced as individuals age and have greater opportunity to select and shape their environments in ways that align with their genetic predispositions.

Modern genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified specific genetic variants associated with intelligence. Large-scale meta-analyses involving hundreds of thousands of participants have identified numerous genetic loci that collectively explain a portion of the variance in cognitive performance [3]. However, these identified variants typically account for only a small fraction of the total heritability estimated from twin studies, a phenomenon known as the "missing heritability" problem.

## Genetic Architecture

Recent advances in molecular genetics have revealed that intelligence is highly polygenic, meaning it is influenced by many genetic variants of small effect rather than a few genes of large effect [2][7]. Current genetic studies suggest that common genetic variants explain approximately 20-25% of the variance in intelligence test scores, though this proportion continues to increase as sample sizes grow and methodological improvements are made [6].

The genetic architecture of intelligence appears to involve thousands of genetic variants distributed across the genome, each contributing a tiny amount to overall cognitive ability. This complexity makes it challenging to predict individual intelligence from genetic information alone, despite the substantial overall heritability.

## Environmental Interactions

While genetic factors are important, environmental influences remain crucial throughout development. The expression of genetic potential for intelligence depends heavily on environmental factors such as education, nutrition, socioeconomic status, and cultural opportunities [1]. Gene-environment interactions mean that the same genetic variants may have different effects depending on environmental contexts.

Additionally, genetic influences on intelligence may partially operate through gene-environment correlations, where individuals with certain genetic predispositions seek out or create environments that further enhance their cognitive development [5]. This dynamic relationship between genes and environment makes it difficult to separate their independent contributions.

## Limitations and Considerations

It's important to note that heritability estimates apply to populations, not individuals, and can vary depending on the range of environments studied. In populations with greater environmental equality, genetic factors may appear more influential, while in populations with significant environmental disparities, environmental factors may play larger roles [1].

Current estimates suggest that genetic factors account for 50-80% of individual differences in intelligence in typical developed populations, but this should be understood within the context of gene-environment interactions rather than as a simple genetic determinism [2][4].
