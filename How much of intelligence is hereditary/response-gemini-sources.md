# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

The heritability of intelligence is significant, but there is no single, simple percentage that applies to all people at all times. Scientific consensus, based on decades of research, shows that genetic factors account for a substantial portion of the variation in intelligence within a population. However, this heritability is not fixed; it changes over a person's lifetime and is profoundly influenced by the environment [1, 2].

Here is a breakdown of what the research shows:

### 1. Estimates from Twin and Adoption Studies
The primary method for estimating heritability has been through twin and adoption studies. These studies compare the similarity of identical twins (who share 100% of their genes) to fraternal twins (who share about 50% of their genes), as well as comparing adopted children to their biological and adoptive parents.

*   **Overall Heritability:** Across numerous studies, the heritability of intelligence is typically estimated to be around 50-60% on average. This means that about half of the observed differences in IQ scores among people in a given population can be attributed to their genetic differences [1, 5].

*   **Increasing Heritability with Age:** A critical and counterintuitive finding is that the heritability of intelligence increases with age. A large meta-analysis of longitudinal studies found that the heritability of cognitive ability is:
    *   About 20% in infancy.
    *   About 40% in childhood.
    *   About 60% in early adulthood.
    *   As high as 80% in later adulthood [4].

    This increase is thought to be due to "gene-environment correlation," where individuals increasingly select, modify, and create environments that align with their genetic predispositions. For example, a child with a genetic inclination for learning may actively seek out books and educational hobbies, which in turn further develops their cognitive abilities, amplifying the initial genetic influence over time [2, 4].

### 2. Evidence from Molecular Genetics
With advances in genomic technology, researchers can now identify specific DNA variants associated with intelligence. These studies, known as Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), scan the genomes of hundreds of thousands of individuals.

*   **Highly Polygenic Nature:** Intelligence is a "polygenic" trait, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genes, each with a very small individual effect. There is no single "intelligence gene" [2, 7].

*   **Identifying Genetic Variants:** Large-scale GWAS have successfully identified thousands of specific genetic variants (SNPs) associated with cognitive function and educational attainment [3, 5]. For instance, a 2018 study involving nearly 270,000 individuals identified 205 genomic locations and 1,016 genes linked to intelligence [3].

*   **The "Missing Heritability" Problem:** While GWAS have confirmed that intelligence is heritable, the specific genes identified so far only account for a fraction (around 10-20%) of the heritability estimated by twin studies (50-80%) [2, 6]. This gap is known as the "missing heritability" problem. It is likely due to the vast number of genes with tiny effects that are difficult to detect, as well as complex interactions between genes and the environment that are not captured by current GWAS methods [2, 7]. A 2024 meta-analysis confirms that while DNA markers can predict some variance in IQ, a large portion of heritability remains unexplained at the molecular level [6].

### 3. The Crucial Role of the Environment
It is essential to understand that "heritable" does not mean "genetically determined" or "unchangeable." The environment plays a critical role in how genetic potential is expressed [1, 2].

*   **Gene-Environment Interaction:** Genes and environment do not operate in isolation; they interact continuously. A supportive and stimulating environment (e.g., good nutrition, high-quality education, low stress) is necessary for an individual to reach their genetic potential for intelligence. Conversely, a deprived environment can suppress genetic potential [1].

*   **Socioeconomic Status (SES):** The influence of genetics on intelligence can vary depending on a family's socioeconomic status. In lower-SES families, environmental factors like access to resources and educational opportunities can be a more significant determinant of a child's IQ than genetics. In higher-SES families, where basic needs are met and opportunities are plentiful, genetic differences may have more room to emerge, leading to higher heritability estimates [1, 4].

### Conclusion
In summary, a substantial portion of the variation in intelligence—averaging 50-60% but increasing to as high as 80% in adulthood—is hereditary [1, 4]. Intelligence is a complex, polygenic trait influenced by thousands of genes, each contributing a tiny amount [2, 3]. However, these genetic predispositions are not deterministic. They interact dynamically with the environment, which can either suppress or amplify their expression. Therefore, while genetics sets a potential range for an individual's intelligence, environmental factors are crucial in determining where within that range an individual will ultimately function [1, 5].

    This article provides an accessible overview of heritability, explaining how twin and adoption studies are used to estimate it. It emphasizes that heritability is a population statistic, not an individual's destiny, and highlights the crucial interaction between genes and environment, noting that heritability estimates can differ by socioeconomic status.
