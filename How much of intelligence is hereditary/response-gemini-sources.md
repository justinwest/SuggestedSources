# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Based on the provided sources, intelligence is significantly hereditary, but it is a complex trait influenced by many genes that interact with environmental factors.

Heritability estimates for intelligence, largely derived from twin studies, are substantial. These studies suggest that about 50% of the variance in intelligence within a population can be attributed to genetic differences [1, 2]. A key finding is that the heritability of intelligence is not static; it increases throughout a person's life. It begins at approximately 20% in infancy, rises to 40% in adolescence, and reaches about 60% in adulthood [1, 2].

The genetic architecture of intelligence is highly complex and polygenic, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genes, each with a very small effect, rather than a single "intelligence gene" [2]. Early research attempting to find specific genes for intelligence was largely unsuccessful. However, modern techniques like Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), which scan the entire genome across many people, have been more successful [2]. One large-scale meta-analysis involving nearly 270,000 individuals successfully identified 52 genome-wide significant loci (specific locations on a chromosome) associated with intelligence, 40 of which were newly discovered [3].

While heritability is high, environmental factors remain critically important [2]. The high heritability figure does not mean that 50% of an individual's intelligence is set at birth. Instead, genes can influence the environments people select and create for themselves. This is known as gene-environment correlation, where a genetic predisposition for intelligence might lead a person to read more books, seek out intellectually stimulating hobbies, and engage with like-minded peers, all of which further develop their cognitive abilities [1, 2].

Researchers can now use the data from GWAS to create "polygenic scores" that aggregate the small effects of thousands of genetic variants. Currently, these scores can predict a small but significant portion of the variance in intelligence, and their predictive power is expected to increase as research continues [2].

1.  This author explains that intelligence is about 50% heritable, with heritability increasing with age. It emphasizes that genes and environment are not separate forces but interact, for example, through people's genetic tendencies leading them to select specific environments.

2.  This review argues that twin studies establish high heritability (~50%), which increases with age. It details the modern understanding that intelligence is highly polygenic (influenced by thousands of genes) and that recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are beginning to identify these genes, allowing for the creation of polygenic scores that can predict a small but significant portion of the variance in intelligence.

3.  This primary research paper presents the results of a large-scale meta-analysis. The authors identified 52 specific gene loci associated with intelligence, 40 of which were new discoveries. This work supports the view that intelligence is polygenic and demonstrates that large-scale genomic studies are a powerful tool for finding the specific genetic variants involved.
