# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Based on the provided sources, a significant portion of the differences in intelligence among people is due to genetics. The research consistently points to intelligence being one of the most heritable behavioral traits [1, 2].

The main findings from the sources on the heritability of intelligence are as follows:

*   **Overall Heritability is About 50%**: Twin and adoption studies consistently find that the heritability of intelligence is approximately 50% [1, 2]. This figure does not mean that 50% of a single person's intelligence is determined by genes. Instead, it means that about half of the observed differences, or variance, in intelligence test scores among people in a given population can be attributed to their genetic differences [1].

*   **Heritability Increases with Age**: A crucial finding is that the heritability of intelligence is not static and increases dramatically throughout a person's life. It is estimated to be around 20% in infancy, 40% in adolescence, and rises to 60% or more in adulthood [1, 2]. This increase is thought to happen because as individuals get older, they have more autonomy to select, modify, and create environments that align with their genetic predispositions, a phenomenon known as "niche-picking" or genetic amplification [1].

*   **Intelligence is Highly Polygenic**: Intelligence is not determined by a single "intelligence gene." Instead, it is a complex, polygenic trait influenced by thousands of genes, each having a very small effect [1, 2]. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have begun identifying the specific genetic variants involved. One large-scale study identified 538 genes associated with intelligence, noting that these genes are primarily expressed in brain tissue and are involved in biological processes such as neurogenesis (the formation of neurons) [3].

While genetics play a substantial role, high heritability does not imply that intelligence is fixed or that environmental factors are unimportant. The environment accounts for the other ~50% of the variance in intelligence within a population, and the interplay between genes and environment is critical [1, 2].

### Sources

1.  **https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-intelligence-hereditary/**: This source, an interview with psychologist Robert Plomin, establishes that intelligence is about 50% heritable. It clarifies that this figure describes population variance, not individual determinism, and emphasizes that heritability increases substantially from infancy to adulthood due to individuals shaping their own environments.
2.  **https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2017.104**: This review article corroborates the ~50% heritability estimate for intelligence and its increase with age. The authors discuss how modern Genome-Wide Association Studies are confirming the polygenic nature of intelligence by identifying thousands of genes with small effects, while stressing that heritability does not equal genetic determinism.
3.  **https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29942086/**: This research paper reports the findings of a large-scale genetic study. The authors identified hundreds of specific genes linked to intelligence, confirming that it is a highly polygenic trait. Their findings provide biological evidence, showing these genes are primarily expressed in the brain and related to neural development.
