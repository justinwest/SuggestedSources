# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Genetic factors are a major contributor to the differences in intelligence among individuals, but the exact proportion is complex and changes over a person's lifetime. The scientific consensus is that intelligence is substantially heritable, with estimates from twin and adoption studies consistently showing that in adulthood, 50% to 80% of the variation in intelligence test scores within a population can be attributed to genetic differences [1, 2, 4].

It is crucial to understand that "heritability" is a population statistic. It describes how much of the variation *in a specific population at a specific time* is due to genetic variation. It does not mean that 50-80% of any single individual's intelligence is determined by their genes. The environment plays a fundamental and inseparable role [1, 2].

### The Influence of Age on Heritability
One of the most robust findings in behavioral genetics is that the heritability of intelligence increases with age. A landmark meta-analysis of longitudinal studies found that the heritability of cognitive ability is approximately:
*   20% in infancy
*   40% in childhood
*   60% in adulthood [4]

Some studies suggest it may climb as high as 80% in later life [2]. This increase is thought to be driven by "gene-environment correlation" (rGE), where individuals increasingly select, modify, and create environments that align with their genetic predispositions. For example, a child with a genetic predisposition for higher cognitive ability may actively seek out more books, enjoy complex puzzles, and ask more questions, thereby creating an intellectually enriched environment that amplifies their genetic potential [4].

### From Twin Studies to Molecular Genetics
Historically, heritability estimates came from twin and adoption studies, which compare the similarity of identical twins (who share 100% of their genes) to fraternal twins (who share about 50%) and adopted siblings. While powerful, these methods couldn't identify the specific genes involved [1, 2].

Modern research uses genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to scan the entire genomes of many thousands of people to find specific genetic variants (known as SNPs) associated with intelligence. This research has confirmed that intelligence is highly polygenic, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genes, each with a very small effect. There is no single "gene for intelligence" [2, 3]. Large-scale GWAS have successfully identified dozens of specific genes and hundreds of genetic loci linked to cognitive function [3, 5].

### Polygenic Scores and "Missing Heritability"
Researchers can use the results of GWAS to create a "polygenic score" (PGS) for an individual, which aggregates the many tiny effects of their genetic variants. Currently, these scores can account for around 10-15% of the variance in intelligence and educational outcomes [2, 6]. While this is a significant scientific achievement, it is far less than the 50-80% heritability estimated by twin studies. This discrepancy is known as the "missing heritability" problem, though the gap is steadily closing as GWAS sample sizes increase and statistical methods improve [2].

Even with their current limitations, polygenic scores provide powerful evidence for the causal role of genes. Studies show that polygenic scores can predict differences in cognitive abilities even between full siblings, who share the same family environment. This helps rule out confounding factors like socioeconomic status and confirms a direct biological link between genes and cognitive outcomes [8, 9].

### The Intricate Interplay of Genes and Environment
High heritability does not imply that the environment is unimportant. On the contrary, genes often exert their influence *through* environmental mechanisms. Genetic factors influence brain development and function, which form the biological basis for intelligence [5]. However, environmental factors like nutrition, education, and socioeconomic status are also critical. A highly heritable trait can still be strongly influenced by the environment; for example, height is highly heritable, but average height has increased dramatically over the last century due to better nutrition [1].

In conclusion, a large portion of the variation in intelligence is hereditary, particularly in adulthood. This heritability is the result of thousands of genes with small effects. While our ability to predict an individual's intelligence from their DNA alone is still limited, research confirms a strong and direct biological link between genetic variation and cognitive ability [2, 6, 9].

This article provides a general overview, explaining the concept of heritability and summarizing the classic findings from twin studies that place the heritability of IQ at around 50%. It emphasizes that heritability is a population measure and that environment plays a crucial role.

This meta-analysis establishes the key finding that the heritability of intelligence increases significantly throughout the lifespan, from about 20% in infancy to 60% in adulthood. The authors argue this is due to gene-environment correlation, where people shape their own environments based on their genetic tendencies.

It describes how genetic variants identified in GWAS are linked to differences in brain structure (e.g., volume) and function, which in turn are associated with cognitive differences.

The authors conclude that while PGS can explain a statistically significant amount of variance at the population level (around 16%), they are not yet precise enough to be useful for individual prediction.
