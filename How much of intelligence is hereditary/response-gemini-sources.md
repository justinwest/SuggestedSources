# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Based on the provided sources, a comprehensive analysis of the heritability of intelligence reveals that genetic factors play a substantial and well-documented role, though their influence is complex, probabilistic, and deeply intertwined with environmental factors [1, 7].

Intelligence, as measured by psychometric tests (e.g., IQ tests), is one of the most heritable psychological traits [2]. However, the answer to "how much" is not a single, fixed number. It varies depending on age and is best understood through evidence from both classical behavioral genetics and modern molecular genetics.

### 1. The Concept and Estimation of Heritability

Heritability is a statistical concept that estimates the proportion of variation in a trait *within a specific population* that can be attributed to genetic differences among individuals in that population [1, 7]. It does not indicate the degree to which an individual's intelligence is determined by their genes. A high heritability for a trait does not mean that the environment is unimportant; it simply means that in the environments studied, genetic differences are a major source of the observed differences in intelligence between people [1, 2].

### 2. Evidence from Twin and Adoption Studies

For decades, the primary method for estimating heritability came from studies comparing identical twins (who share ~100% of their segregating genes) with fraternal twins (who share ~50%, like other siblings). These studies consistently find that identical twins are significantly more similar in cognitive ability than fraternal twins [4, 7].

A key finding from this research is that the heritability of intelligence **increases with age**:
*   **In infancy**, heritability is estimated to be around 20% [4].
*   **In childhood**, it rises to about 40% [4].
*   **In adulthood**, heritability stabilizes at approximately 60%, with some studies suggesting it may rise to 80% in later life [1, 4].

This increase is thought to be a result of **gene-environment correlation**, where individuals increasingly select, modify, and create environments that align with their genetic predispositions. For example, a child with a genetic propensity for higher cognitive ability may seek out more books, engage in more complex hobbies, and enjoy school more, thereby amplifying their initial genetic advantages over time [4, 7].

### 3. Insights from Modern Molecular Genetics

While twin studies estimate the *overall* genetic influence, modern genetics seeks to identify the specific DNA variants responsible. Research using Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) has shown that intelligence is highly **polygenic**, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genetic variants, each having a very small individual effect [2, 5]. There is no single "gene for intelligence" [1].

Key findings from this molecular research include:
*   Large-scale GWAS, such as one meta-analysis of nearly 270,000 individuals, have successfully identified hundreds of specific genetic loci and genes associated with intelligence [3, 5].
*   These findings have enabled the creation of **Polygenic Scores (PGS)**, which aggregate the effects of thousands of these variants to predict an individual's genetic predisposition for cognitive ability.
*   Current polygenic scores can account for a significant portion of the variance in intelligence—up to 16% in some recent, large-scale studies [6, 9]. While this is a substantial leap in predictive power, it is still much lower than the 60% heritability estimated by twin studies. This gap is known as the "missing heritability," though it is steadily closing as research methods improve [2].
*   Crucially, recent studies that use within-family designs (comparing the PGS of siblings) confirm that these genetic associations are not merely artifacts of socioeconomic or ancestral background. Siblings who inherit more of the intelligence-associated genetic variants tend to have higher cognitive ability and educational attainment than their siblings who inherit fewer, demonstrating a direct causal link within families [8, 9].

### Conclusion

In summary, a large body of evidence from multiple fields of research converges on the conclusion that intelligence is substantially heritable. Classical twin and adoption studies suggest that in developed countries, about 60% of the differences in adult intelligence can be explained by genetic differences [4]. This heritability increases throughout a person's life as individuals actively shape their own intellectual environments in ways that correlate with their genetic makeup [4, 7].

Modern molecular genetics confirms this finding by identifying thousands of specific DNA variants that contribute to cognitive abilities. While these variants currently predict a smaller portion of the variance (~16%), they provide direct evidence for the biological underpinnings of intelligence and are powerful tools for research [6, 9]. Ultimately, intelligence emerges from a complex, lifelong interplay between a significant genetic foundation and a wide range of environmental and developmental factors [1, 5].

This article provides a general overview, explaining that while intelligence is highly heritable (around 80% in some adult estimates), heritability is a population statistic, not a measure of an individual's destiny. It emphasizes that genes are not deterministic and work in concert with the environment.

Authored by leading researcher Robert Plomin, this review summarizes the shift from estimating heritability with twin studies to identifying specific genes with GWAS. It highlights that intelligence is highly heritable and polygenic, and that polygenic scores are becoming increasingly predictive, ushering in a "new era" for genetics research.

This meta-analysis establishes a key finding in the field: the heritability of intelligence increases dramatically with age, from ~20% in infancy to ~60% in adulthood. The authors argue this is due to gene-environment correlation, where people's genetic predispositions lead them to select and create environments that foster their cognitive growth.

This 2024 meta-analysis synthesizes the results of recent studies on the predictive power of polygenic scores for intelligence. It concludes that the correlation is robust and that polygenic scores can explain about 16% of the variance in IQ, confirming that DNA makes a "big deal" of a difference.
