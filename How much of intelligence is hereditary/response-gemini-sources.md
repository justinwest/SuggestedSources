# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Based on the provided sources, intelligence is understood to be one of the most heritable psychological traits, though the exact influence of genetics is complex, changes over a person's lifetime, and is deeply intertwined with environmental factors [1, 2].

Heritability is a statistical concept that estimates the proportion of variation in a trait *within a population* that can be attributed to genetic differences among individuals in that population. It does not mean that a specific percentage of an individual's intelligence is determined by their genes [1, 5].

Key findings from the research include:

**1. Heritability Increases with Age**
A major finding from decades of research is that the heritability of intelligence is not static but increases significantly throughout a person's life. A large-scale meta-analysis of twin and adoption studies published in *Psychological Science* found that the heritability of cognitive ability is:
*   Approximately 20% in infancy.
*   Around 40% in childhood.
*   About 60% in early adulthood.
*   As high as 80% in later life [4].

This increase is thought to occur because as people age, they have more autonomy to select, modify, and create environments that align with their genetic predispositions. This process, known as gene-environment correlation, amplifies the influence of initial genetic tendencies over time [2, 4].

**2. The Genetic Architecture is Highly Polygenic**
There is no single "gene for intelligence." Instead, intelligence is a highly polygenic trait, influenced by thousands of genetic variants, each with a very small effect [2, 7]. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which scan the entire genome for common variants associated with a trait, have been instrumental in identifying these variants. A 2018 meta-analysis published in *Nature Genetics*, involving nearly 270,000 individuals, identified 205 genomic loci and over 1,000 specific genes associated with intelligence. These genes are predominantly expressed in brain tissue and are involved in processes like neurogenesis (the formation of neurons) and the development of synapses [3, 5].

**3. Predictive Power of Genetics and Its Limitations**
Using the findings from GWAS, researchers can create polygenic scores (PGS) that aggregate an individual's many genetic variants to predict their cognitive ability. However, there is a significant gap between the high heritability estimates from twin studies (50-80%) and the predictive power of current polygenic scores. A 2024 meta-analysis found that PGS for intelligence currently explain about 10-16% of the variance in IQ scores [6].

Studies using sibling pairs have shown that polygenic scores can predict differences in intelligence even between siblings who share the same family environment, strengthening the evidence for a direct causal link between these genes and cognitive ability [8]. However, a very recent 2024 PNAS study adds a crucial layer of nuance, finding that the predictive power of polygenic scores is partially confounded by the family environment and socioeconomic status. This suggests that some of what PGSs predict may not be a direct biological effect but rather a reflection of environmental advantages passed down alongside genes [9].

**4. The Role of the Environment**
A high heritability estimate does not diminish the importance of the environment. Genetic predispositions always express themselves within an environmental context. Factors such as nutrition, education, family environment, and socioeconomic status are critical for cognitive development [1, 2]. The interaction between genes and environment is fundamental; for example, genetic potential for high intelligence may not be realized in a severely deprived environment [2].

In summary, twin studies suggest that genetic differences account for about 50% of the variance in intelligence in a population, with this figure rising to as high as 80% in late adulthood. Molecular genetics has confirmed that this heritability is due to the cumulative small effects of thousands of genes related to brain function. However, our current ability to predict intelligence directly from DNA is still limited, and the influence of genes is complexly entangled with environmental factors that shape development throughout life [2, 6, 9].

    This article provides a general overview, explaining that while twin studies suggest a heritability of around 50%, "heritability" is a population statistic about variance, not a measure of how much of an individual's IQ is genetic. It emphasizes the crucial role of the environment.

    This review summarizes the shift from twin studies to molecular genetics (GWAS). The authors state that intelligence is highly heritable and polygenic, involving thousands of genes of small effect. They discuss the "missing heritability" problem and the increasing heritability of intelligence with age.

    This primary research paper reports a large-scale GWAS that identified hundreds of specific genes and genetic loci associated with intelligence. It provides biological evidence by showing these genes are linked to brain development and synaptic function.

    This meta-analysis provides the key evidence that the heritability of intelligence increases dramatically with age, from about 20% in infancy to 60-80% in adulthood. The authors attribute this to active gene-environment correlation.

    This 2024 meta-analysis synthesizes research on the predictive power of polygenic scores (PGS). It concludes that current PGS can account for approximately 10-16% of the variance in intelligence, highlighting the gap between heritability estimates and current molecular prediction.

    This study uses a within-family design to show that polygenic scores predict differences in cognitive abilities even between full siblings, controlling for shared environmental factors and strengthening the case for a causal genetic effect.

    This recent 2024 study demonstrates that the predictive accuracy of polygenic scores for intelligence is significantly reduced when controlling for family background (e.g., parental genetics and socioeconomic status). This suggests that PGS predictions are partly inflated by environmental factors that are correlated with genes.
