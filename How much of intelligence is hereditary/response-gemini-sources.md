# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Based on the provided sources, intelligence is a complex trait with a substantial hereditary component, but it is not entirely determined by genetics. The scientific consensus is that both genes and environment play crucial roles, and their interplay changes throughout a person's life [1, 2].

### Key Findings on the Heritability of Intelligence

1.  **Heritability Estimates:** Twin, adoption, and family studies consistently show that intelligence is one of the most heritable psychological traits [2, 5]. Heritability is a statistical measure that estimates how much of the variation in a trait within a population can be attributed to genetic differences. For intelligence, this figure for adults in developed countries is typically estimated to be between 50% and 80% [4, 5]. This means that genetic factors are a major source of the differences in intelligence observed among people [1].

2.  **Heritability Increases with Age:** A critical finding is that the heritability of intelligence increases significantly over a person's lifespan. A large-scale meta-analysis of twin and adoption studies found that the heritability of cognitive ability is approximately:
    *   20% in infancy
    *   40% in childhood
    *   60% in adulthood [4]
    *   Reaching as high as 80% in later life [5]

    This increase is thought to happen because of **gene-environment correlation (rGE)**. As people get older, they gain more autonomy to select, modify, and create environments that align with their genetic predispositions. For instance, a child with a genetic propensity for higher cognitive ability may actively seek out intellectually stimulating activities, books, and peers, thereby amplifying their initial genetic potential [4, 10].

3.  **The Genetic Architecture of Intelligence:** There is no single "gene for intelligence." Instead, intelligence is highly **polygenic**, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genetic variants, each with a very small individual effect [2, 3]. Large-scale Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of these specific DNA variants (known as SNPs) associated with intelligence and educational attainment [3, 5].

4.  **Predictive Power of Genetics:** Using information from GWAS, researchers can create **Polygenic Scores (PGS)** to predict a person's cognitive abilities from their DNA. While these scores do not capture all the genetic influence, their predictive power is steadily improving. Current polygenic scores can account for over 10% of the variance in intelligence, a figure that is substantial for a molecular-level prediction in the social sciences [6, 2]. Within-family studies, which compare siblings, confirm that these genetic scores predict differences in intelligence even when controlling for shared family environment and socioeconomic status, strengthening the evidence for a direct causal role of the inherited genes [8].

### The Role of Environment and Gene-Environment Interplay

While heritability is high, it does not imply that intelligence is fixed or that the environment is unimportant [1].

*   **Heritability is a Population Statistic:** Heritability describes the source of *variation* within a specific population at a specific time; it says nothing about what causes a trait in an individual. High heritability does not preclude the powerful effects of environment, such as schooling, nutrition, or exposure to toxins [1, 2].
*   **Gene-Environment Interplay:** Genes and environments are not independent forces; they constantly interact. A recent concept called **"genetic nurture"** highlights this complexity. It describes how parents' genes influence the environment they provide for their children (e.g., the amount of cognitive stimulation at home), which in turn shapes the child's cognitive development. This effect is distinct from the genes the child inherits directly [9].
*   **The Brain as a Mediator:** Genetic influences on intelligence are not abstract. Research shows that genetic variants associated with intelligence are also linked to differences in brain structure and function, such as total brain volume, cortical thickness, and the efficiency of neural networks [5]. Genes help build the brain, and the resulting brain characteristics are what underpin cognitive abilities.

In summary, a large portion of the variation in intelligence within populations is due to genetic differences. This genetic influence grows stronger as individuals age and increasingly shape their own environments. However, genetics is not destiny; intelligence emerges from a complex and continuous interplay between thousands of genes, the environment, and the development of the brain [2, 5].

    *   This article provides a general overview, concluding that while intelligence has a strong genetic component (around 50% heritability), it is not genetically determined. It emphasizes the importance of the environment and clarifies that heritability is a population statistic, not a measure of an individual's destiny.

    *   This review paper by Robert Plomin and Sophie von Stumm summarizes the shift from traditional twin studies to modern molecular genetics (GWAS). It highlights that intelligence is highly heritable and polygenic and that DNA-based predictions are becoming increasingly powerful, though they do not negate the role of the environment.

    *   This primary research paper is a large-scale GWAS. Its authors identified numerous new genetic variants (SNPs) and genes associated with intelligence, providing concrete molecular evidence for its polygenic nature and heritability.

    *   This meta-analysis establishes the key finding that the heritability of intelligence increases dramatically from infancy (20%) to adulthood (60%). The authors argue this is best explained by gene-environment correlation, where individuals' genetic propensities lead them to select environments that amplify those traits.

    *   This review connects the genetics of intelligence to its biological basis in the brain. The authors show that genetic variants influencing intelligence are also associated with variations in brain structure and function, providing a mechanism for how genes affect cognitive abilities. They affirm a high heritability for intelligence (up to 80%).

    *   This 2024 meta-analysis focuses on the predictive power of polygenic scores for intelligence. The authors conclude that while the amount of variance explained is still a minority of the total, it is substantial and robust, making DNA a significant predictor of IQ differences.

    *   This study uses a robust within-family design to test polygenic scores. The authors demonstrate that genetic scores predict differences in cognitive traits even between full siblings, which helps rule out confounding factors like family socioeconomic status and confirms a direct causal link from the inherited genes.
