Based on decades of research, intelligence is one of the most heritable psychological traits studied [1, 2]. Heritability is a statistical measure that estimates the proportion of differences in a trait *among individuals in a population* that can be attributed to genetic differences [1]. It does not indicate how much of a single individual's intelligence is due to their genes. The scientific consensus is that genetic factors play a substantial role in the variation of intelligence, but the exact contribution and mechanisms are complex and change over a person's lifetime [2, 4].

### Heritability Estimates from Twin and Adoption Studies

For many years, the primary evidence for the heritability of intelligence came from studies of twins, adoptees, and families. These studies consistently show that genetics are a major contributor to intelligence differences [1, 2].

*   **Overall Heritability:** In adulthood, heritability estimates for intelligence are typically high, ranging from 50% to as high as 80% [1, 2, 5]. This means that in the populations studied, 50-80% of the observed variation in adult intelligence scores can be linked to genetic variation.
*   **Increasing Heritability with Age:** A critical finding is that the heritability of intelligence increases significantly throughout a person's life. A large meta-analysis of longitudinal studies found that the heritability of cognitive ability is approximately 20% in infancy, rises to 40% in childhood, and reaches about 60% in early adulthood, with some studies suggesting it climbs to 80% in later life [4, 5]. This phenomenon is thought to occur because of "gene-environment correlation," where individuals with certain genetic predispositions actively select, modify, and create environments that align with and amplify those genetic tendencies [4].

### The New Genetics: Molecular Evidence from DNA

Modern genetics, particularly through Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), has moved from estimating heritability to identifying the specific genetic variants involved [2].

*   **Intelligence is Highly Polygenic:** Research has confirmed that there is no single "gene for intelligence." Instead, intelligence is a highly polygenic trait, influenced by thousands of genetic variants, each having a very small individual effect [2, 3, 5]. A landmark 2018 meta-analysis involving nearly 270,000 individuals identified over 200 genes and thousands of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with intelligence [3]. The identified genes are primarily expressed in brain tissue and are involved in crucial biological processes like neuron development and synaptic regulation [3, 5].
*   **SNP-Based Heritability:** GWAS allows researchers to calculate "SNP-based heritability," which is the portion of intelligence variation that can be explained by the common genetic variants measured in these studies. This figure is typically lower than the heritability estimates from twin studies (around 25% or more) because current GWAS primarily captures common genetic variants and does not yet fully account for rare variants, gene-gene interactions, or gene-environment interactions [2, 5]. The gap between twin-based heritability and SNP-based heritability is known as the "missing heritability" problem, which researchers are actively working to solve [2].

### Predictive Power of Genetic Scores

Using the results from GWAS, scientists can create a "polygenic score" (PGS) for an individual, which aggregates the many small genetic effects to estimate their genetic predisposition for intelligence [8].

*   **Current Predictive Ability:** While still far from perfectly predicting a person's IQ, the predictive power of polygenic scores has become scientifically and practically significant. Current polygenic scores can account for over 10% of the variance in intelligence, a figure that is expected to grow as GWAS sample sizes increase [6, 8].
*   **Within-Family Validation:** To ensure these scores are capturing true genetic effects and not just social or environmental factors that are correlated with genetics, studies have tested them within families. Research shows that polygenic scores can successfully predict differences in intelligence and educational outcomes even between biological siblings, who share the same family environment but differ genetically [8].

In summary, a large proportion of the variation in intelligence within a population is due to genetic factors. Heritability is substantial, increasing from childhood to adulthood to as high as 80% [4]. Modern research has identified thousands of specific genes that contribute to these differences [3]. While the environment is undeniably crucial, genetic predispositions play a major role in shaping cognitive ability [1, 2].
