# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Based on decades of research, intelligence is one of the most heritable psychological traits [1, 2]. However, the term "heritability" is often misunderstood. It does not refer to how much of a single individual's intelligence is due to their genes, but rather the extent to which *differences in intelligence among people within a population* can be explained by their genetic differences [1, 5].

The consensus from extensive research provides several key insights into the heritability of intelligence:

### 1. Heritability Estimates from Twin and Adoption Studies
For nearly a century, scientists have used twin and adoption studies to estimate the heritability of intelligence. By comparing identical twins (who share 100% of their genes) with fraternal twins (who share about 50% of their genes), researchers can infer the influence of genetics. These studies consistently find that the heritability of intelligence is substantial, averaging around 50% across the lifespan [2, 5].

A crucial and well-replicated finding is that the heritability of intelligence increases significantly with age [2, 4]. A meta-analysis of longitudinal studies confirmed this trend:
*   In infancy, heritability is about 20%.
*   In childhood, it rises to around 40%.
*   In adulthood, it increases to 60% and can reach as high as 80% in later life [4, 5].

This increase is thought to be caused by "gene-environment correlation," where individuals increasingly select, modify, and create environments that align with their genetic predispositions. For example, a child with a genetic propensity for higher cognitive ability may seek out more books, enjoy complex puzzles, and engage in intellectually stimulating hobbies, thereby amplifying the initial genetic influence over time [2, 4].

### 2. Evidence from Modern DNA Analysis
With advances in genetics, scientists can now analyze DNA directly to identify specific genetic variants associated with intelligence. This research has confirmed the findings from twin studies while adding significant detail [2, 7].

*   **Polygenic Nature**: Intelligence is highly polygenic, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genetic variants, each with a very small individual effect. There is no single "gene for intelligence" [1, 5].
*   **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)**: Large-scale GWAS involving hundreds of thousands of individuals have successfully identified hundreds of specific genetic variants (SNPs) associated with intelligence and closely related traits like educational attainment [3, 7]. The identified genes are primarily expressed in the brain and are involved in biological pathways related to neurogenesis and synaptic regulation, providing a direct link between genetic variation and brain function [3, 5].
*   **Polygenic Scores**: By combining the effects of thousands of these variants, researchers create "polygenic scores." While early GWAS could only explain a small fraction of the variance in intelligence (a problem known as "missing heritability"), current polygenic scores can now account for over 10% of the variance [2, 6]. Within-family studies, which compare siblings, confirm that this predictive power is genuinely due to inherited DNA and not just shared family environment or social background [8].

### 3. The Interplay of Genes and Environment
A high heritability estimate does not diminish the importance of the environment [1]. Genes and environment are not separate, opposing forces; they work together throughout development. Environmental factors like nutrition, education, and socioeconomic status are critical for cognitive development.

Heritability is a population statistic that describes "what is" in a given population at a specific time, not "what could be" if environmental factors were to change [1]. For example, if everyone had access to an optimal learning environment, the remaining differences in intelligence would be more attributable to genetics, and heritability would be even higher. Conversely, in populations with vast environmental inequalities, heritability would be lower because the environment plays a larger role in creating differences between people [2].

In summary, a substantial portion of the variation in intelligence within a population—around 50% to 80%, depending on age—is due to genetic differences. This influence is not due to a few genes but thousands acting in concert. This genetic predisposition interacts with the environment, becoming more pronounced as individuals shape their own intellectual experiences throughout their lives [2, 4, 5].

    *   This article provides a general overview, explaining that while intelligence is significantly heritable (around 50%), the term "heritability" is a population statistic, not a measure of an individual's destiny. It emphasizes that environment is crucial and that there is no single "smart gene."

    *   Authors Robert Plomin and Sophie von Stumm argue that intelligence is one of the most heritable behavioral traits. They summarize key findings, such as the increase in heritability with age, and review the shift from twin studies to DNA-based GWAS, highlighting the polygenic nature of intelligence and the predictive power of polygenic scores.

    *   This primary research paper by Sniekers et al. is a large-scale GWAS. The authors report identifying 52 genes linked to intelligence, many of which are involved in neuronal regulation. This study provides concrete evidence for the specific genetic variants and biological pathways that contribute to differences in intelligence.

    *   This meta-analysis by Bergen, Gardner, and Kendler synthesizes data from multiple studies to confirm that the heritability of cognitive ability increases throughout the lifespan, from about 20% in infancy to 60% in adulthood. The authors support the theory of gene-environment correlation as the primary explanation for this phenomenon.

    *   This review by Plomin et al. reinforces that intelligence is highly heritable and polygenic. It connects the findings from GWAS to brain structure and function, arguing that thousands of genes with small effects influence intelligence by affecting the brain, and that these genetic effects become more pronounced with age.

    *   This 2024 meta-analysis by Davide Piffer examines the predictive power of polygenic scores for intelligence. The author concludes that the predictive accuracy is substantial and has been consistently increasing with larger GWAS sample sizes, demonstrating that the DNA-based findings are a "big deal" for understanding the sources of individual differences in IQ.
