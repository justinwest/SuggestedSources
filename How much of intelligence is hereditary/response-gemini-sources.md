# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Based on decades of research, intelligence is understood to be a complex trait influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The scientific consensus is that a substantial portion of the variation in intelligence scores among individuals is attributable to genetic differences [1, 2].

The heritability of intelligence—the proportion of observed differences in a trait among individuals of a population that are due to genetic differences—is estimated to be around 50% on average, but this figure changes significantly throughout a person's life [4, 6].

### Heritability Increases with Age
One of the most consistent findings in behavioral genetics is that the heritability of intelligence increases with age. This phenomenon is known as genetic amplification [2, 4].
*   **Infancy:** Heritability is estimated to be around 20% [4].
*   **Childhood:** It rises to about 40% [4].
*   **Adolescence and Early Adulthood:** It increases further to approximately 60% [6].
*   **Later Adulthood:** Heritability can be as high as 80% [2, 6].

This increase is thought to occur because as individuals age, they gain more independence to select and create their own environments. This process, called gene-environment correlation, means that people's genetic predispositions lead them to seek out experiences and environments that align with and enhance their innate abilities, thereby amplifying the initial genetic influence [4, 5].

### The Genetic Architecture of Intelligence
Early research relied on twin and adoption studies to estimate heritability, but modern molecular genetics now aims to identify the specific genes involved [2, 5]. Key findings from this research include:

*   **Intelligence is Highly Polygenic:** There is no single "intelligence gene." Instead, intelligence is influenced by thousands of genes, each with a very small individual effect [2, 3].
*   **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS):** These studies scan the entire genomes of large populations to find genetic variants associated with intelligence. A landmark 2018 meta-analysis involving nearly 270,000 individuals identified hundreds of genetic loci and specific genes linked to intelligence [3].
*   **Biological Pathways:** The genes identified through GWAS are primarily involved in biological processes related to brain development, neurogenesis (the creation of new neurons), and the formation of synapses (the connections between neurons) [3, 7].
*   **"Missing Heritability":** While overall heritability is estimated to be high (up to 80%), the specific genetic variants identified so far only account for a fraction of this variance (around 5-10%) [2, 3]. This gap is known as "missing heritability" and is gradually closing as study sizes increase and more sophisticated methods are used [5].

### The Essential Role of the Environment
A high heritability estimate does not mean that environment is unimportant [1]. Genes do not operate in a vacuum.
*   **Shared vs. Non-Shared Environment:** Environmental influences are categorized as either shared (e.g., family socioeconomic status, home life) or non-shared (e.g., unique experiences, different friends, illness). The influence of the shared family environment is significant in childhood but decreases substantially by adulthood, while the impact of the non-shared environment remains important [4, 6].
*   **The "Nature of Nurture":** As mentioned earlier, a key way genes work is by influencing the environments we experience. This concept, dubbed the "nature of nurture," shows how genetic and environmental influences are intertwined rather than separate forces [4].

In conclusion, a large portion of the variation in intelligence—ranging from 20% in infancy to as high as 80% in adulthood—is hereditary. This heritability stems from the cumulative small effects of thousands of genes. However, these genes exert their influence by shaping how individuals interact with and select their environments, making the development of intelligence a dynamic and continuous interplay between nature and nurture [2, 6].

It introduces the concept of heritability increasing with age, based on twin and adoption studies.
2.  **Nature Reviews Genetics - The new genetics of intelligence** ([https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2017.104](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2017.104)): This review article by Robert Plomin and Sophie von Stumm summarizes the state of modern research. It confirms that intelligence is one of the most heritable behavioral traits, with heritability increasing to about 80% in adulthood. It emphasizes the polygenic nature of intelligence and the shift towards identifying specific genes through Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS).

The authors report identifying hundreds of independent genetic loci associated with intelligence, implicating genes involved in nervous system development and synaptic regulation, providing concrete molecular evidence for the genetic basis of intelligence.

The author, Robert Plomin, emphasizes that heritability increases dramatically with age, the influence of shared family environment wanes, and genes work by influencing how people shape their own environments (the "nature of nurture").

He explains the power of polygenic scores derived from GWAS to predict intelligence and the complex, polygenic architecture of the trait.

The authors argue the focus should now be on understanding the interplay between genes and environment (GxE and rGE).
