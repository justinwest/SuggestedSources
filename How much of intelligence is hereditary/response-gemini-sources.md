# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Scientific research indicates that intelligence, as measured by cognitive ability tests, is one of the most heritable psychological traits [2, 5]. However, the extent of this genetic influence is complex, changing over a person's lifetime and involving an intricate interplay with environmental factors [1, 4].

### Key Findings on the Heritability of Intelligence

**1. Heritability Increases with Age**
A central finding from decades of research is that the heritability of intelligence is not static. A meta-analysis of longitudinal twin and adoption studies published in *Psychological Science* found that the proportion of variance in intelligence attributable to genetic factors increases dramatically from childhood to adulthood [4].
*   **In infancy**, heritability is estimated to be around 20%.
*   **In childhood**, it rises to about 40%.
*   **In adolescence and young adulthood**, it reaches approximately 60-65% [4, 7].
*   **In later adulthood**, some studies suggest heritability can be as high as 80% [1, 2].

This increase is thought to be caused by a phenomenon called gene-environment correlation, or "niche-picking." As individuals grow older, they gain more autonomy to select, modify, and create their own environments. People with genetic predispositions toward higher cognitive ability may be more inclined to seek out intellectually stimulating activities, friends, and careers, which in turn further develop their cognitive skills, amplifying the initial genetic influence [1, 4].

**2. Intelligence is Highly Polygenic**
There is no single "gene for intelligence." Instead, intelligence is a highly polygenic trait, meaning its genetic basis is spread across thousands of genetic variants, each with a very small individual effect [2, 7]. Large-scale Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with cognitive ability and educational attainment [3, 5]. A major 2018 meta-analysis published in *Nature Genetics* involving nearly 270,000 individuals identified over 200 genomic loci and more than 1,000 genes linked to intelligence [3].

**3. Predicting Intelligence from DNA and Its Limitations**
Researchers use the findings from GWAS to create polygenic scores (PGS), which aggregate the effects of thousands of genetic variants to predict a person's cognitive abilities. Current PGS can account for over 10% of the variance in intelligence, making them one of the most powerful predictors in psychological science [2, 6].

However, recent and more sophisticated research has revealed significant limitations. Studies that compare siblings—who share on average 50% of their DNA but 100% of their parental home environment—show that the predictive power of polygenic scores is substantially reduced. This suggests that a large part of what PGS predict is not the direct effect of a person's genes, but rather a combination of factors including:
*   **Family Environment**: The socio-economic status and educational environment provided by parents, which is correlated with the parents' own genes [8, 9].
*   **Indirect Genetic Effects**: The influence of parents' genes on the environment they create for their children (often called "genetic nurture") [8].

When these family-level confounds are controlled for in within-sibling studies, the direct predictive power of an individual's own genes is lower than previously thought, though still statistically significant [8, 9]. This highlights that genes and environment are deeply intertwined, not separate forces.

**4. The Indispensable Role of the Environment**
Even with high heritability estimates, the environment remains critically important. Heritability describes the genetic contribution to *differences* among individuals within a specific population, not how much of a single individual's intelligence is determined by their genes [1]. A genetic predisposition for high intelligence may not be realized in an environment lacking adequate nutrition, safety, or educational opportunities. Conversely, a supportive and stimulating environment can help individuals reach their full cognitive potential [1, 5].

In conclusion, a substantial portion of the variation in intelligence within a population is due to genetic factors, with heritability estimates increasing from about 20% in infancy to as high as 80% in late adulthood. This influence comes from the cumulative effect of thousands of genes. However, genetic predispositions are expressed and amplified through continuous interaction with the environment, and recent research shows that the predictive power of genetic scores is partially confounded by family background and social factors, underscoring that genes are not destiny [1, 8, 9].

1.  **[Is Intelligence Hereditary?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-intelligence-hereditary/) – *Scientific American***
    This article provides a general overview, concluding that while intelligence is highly heritable (around 80% in adulthood), genes are not deterministic. It emphasizes the role of the environment and the concept of "niche-picking," where individuals with certain genetic predispositions actively seek out environments that foster their cognitive development.

    Authored by Robert Plomin and Sophie von Stumm, this review argues that intelligence is one of the most heritable behavioral traits. It details the shift from twin studies to GWAS, highlighting that DNA variants can now account for a significant portion of the variance in intelligence and that this will have important implications for both science and society.

    This primary research paper presents the results of a large-scale GWAS. The authors identify hundreds of genes and genetic variants associated with intelligence, confirming that it is a highly polygenic trait and demonstrating that these variants are concentrated in genes expressed in brain tissue.

    This meta-analysis establishes a key finding in the field. The authors show that the heritability of cognitive ability increases linearly from early childhood (around 41%) to young adulthood (around 66%), attributing this to gene-environment correlations that strengthen as people age.

    This review connects genetic findings to neuroscience. The authors describe how thousands of genetic variants influence brain structure and function, which in turn underlies individual differences in intelligence. They stress that both genes and environment contribute to brain development and cognitive ability.

    This meta-analysis assesses the predictive power of polygenic scores for intelligence. The authors conclude that while the predictions are statistically significant and represent a major scientific advance ("Big Deal"), the amount of variance explained is still modest from a practical, individual-level prediction standpoint ("Much Ado About Nothing").

    This study uses a powerful within-family design. The authors show that the predictive power of polygenic scores for intelligence is significantly reduced (by about half) when comparing siblings. This indicates that much of the predictive association found in standard studies is due to family-wide environmental factors and indirect genetic effects from parents, not just the direct effect of an individual's own genes.

    This recent PNAS article reinforces the findings from other within-family studies. The authors demonstrate that polygenic score predictions for intelligence are heavily confounded by family background. After accounting for these confounds, the direct genetic effect is smaller, highlighting the critical role of the environment that is correlated with genetics.
