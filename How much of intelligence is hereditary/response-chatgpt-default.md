# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Intelligence is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, but neither set of influences is fixed or simple. Below is a synthesis of what behavioral genetics, molecular genetics, and developmental psychology currently tell us.

1. What “heritability” means  
• Heritability is a population‐level statistic: it estimates the proportion of the observed variation in a trait that can be attributed to genetic differences among individuals living in a particular environment at a particular time.  
• It does NOT tell us how “genetically determined” an individual’s intelligence is, and it does NOT mean that the trait is unchangeable.  
• Heritability can rise or fall if environmental conditions change—e.g., if educational quality improves for everyone, the remaining differences may become more strongly related to genes, raising heritability.

2. Estimates from twin and adoption studies  
Meta-analyses combining thousands of twin and adoption pairs give the clearest picture:

  Age range (approx.)  Heritability (h²)  Shared environment (c²)  Non-shared environment & error (e²)  
  Early childhood (2–6)         0.20–0.35    0.30–0.40        0.30–0.40  
  Middle childhood (7–12)      0.35–0.50    0.20–0.30        0.30–0.40  
  Adolescence (13–18)           0.45–0.60    0.10–0.20        0.30–0.40  
  Young–mid-adulthood (18–65)   0.55–0.80    ≈0.05 or less       0.25–0.35  
  Late adulthood (65+)          0.50–0.70 (estimates widen owing to health variability)

Key points:  
• Heritability rises from childhood into adulthood, a pattern sometimes called the “Wilson effect.”  
• The influence of the shared family environment (c²) is substantial in childhood but tapers off by late adolescence.  
• Roughly 20–35 % of the variation remains tied to non-shared environmental factors (different peers, illnesses, life events) and measurement error at all ages.

3. Moderators of heritability  
• Socio-economic status (SES). In several U.S. datasets, heritability is lower (sometimes <0.30) for children growing up in poverty and higher (>0.70) for those in affluent homes; Europe shows weaker or absent moderation, probably because basic resources are more uniformly available.  
• Schooling quality, nutrition, exposure to toxins, and social policies can all compress or expand environmental differences, changing heritability.  
• Culture: heritability estimates are not identical across countries; they cluster around 0.50–0.70 for most industrialized nations, but data from low-income countries are sparse.

4. Findings from molecular genetics  
• Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify thousands of common variants that contribute tiny additive effects. Polygenic scores built from these variants currently predict about 10–20 % of IQ variance in samples of European ancestry; predictive accuracy is lower in other ancestries, reflecting Euro-centric discovery samples and population‐specific linkage patterns.  
• The gap between twin‐study heritability (~60–70 %) and polygenic prediction (~10–20 %) is called “missing heritability.” It likely reflects many undiscovered common variants, rare variants, structural variations, and epigenetic or gene–gene interactions not yet captured by current methods.

5. Gene–environment interplay  
• Gene–environment correlation: Children’s genetic propensities lead them to select, modify, or evoke environments (e.g., a verbally curious child may seek books).  
• Gene × environment interaction: The same genetic predisposition can yield different cognitive outcomes in different environments (e.g., lead exposure might blunt the expression of genes that otherwise support higher IQ).  
• These dynamic processes help explain why heritability increases with age: people progressively shape niches that fit their genetically influenced preferences and talents.

6. Practical implications and caveats  
• High heritability does NOT make educational or social interventions futile. Height is ~0.80 heritable, yet nutrition and medical care still raise average stature.  
• Heritability within a group says nothing about the causes of average differences between groups; those can be entirely environmental even when within-group heritability is high.  
• Current genetic predictors do not offer precise forecasts for individuals; environmental influences, chance events, and measurement error leave substantial unpredictability.  
• Because intelligence is polygenic and multifactorial, “genetic editing” or other purported shortcuts remain far beyond realistic reach.

7. Bottom line  
In modern, economically developed societies, genetic differences account for roughly half to two-thirds of the variation in measured intelligence among adults; the remainder is shaped by unique life experiences, early family environment, and random developmental factors. The exact proportion is not fixed and will shift as environments change or as our ability to detect genetic effects improves.
