# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

**Genetic Contribution (Heritability) of Intelligence:** Intelligence is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and researchers often quantify the genetic influence using the concept of *heritability*. Heritability refers to the proportion of variation in intelligence (usually measured by IQ tests) within a population that can be attributed to genetic differences. Broadly speaking, studies have found that roughly 50% of the variance in IQ scores is associated with genetic factors, meaning about half of the differences in intelligence across individuals can be explained by heredity under typical conditions ([webspace.ship.edu](https://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/iku.html#:~:text=changes%20with%20age%3A%20h,zero%20in%20some%20studies)). In fact, consensus reports by experts (including an American Psychological Association task force) put the heritability of IQ at roughly **0.45 in childhood** and rising to about **0.75 in late adolescence and adulthood** ([webspace.ship.edu](https://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/iku.html#:~:text=changes%20with%20age%3A%20h,zero%20in%20some%20studies)). In other words, genes contribute moderately to intelligence in early life and very strongly by adulthood. Other reviews similarly find **heritability estimates between about 40% and 80%** for intelligence, depending on the population and methods used ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3341646/#:~:text=The%20heritability%20of%20intelligence%20is,studies%20carried%20out%20in%20the)). This still means a substantial portion of IQ variation (often around 20–50%) is due to non-genetic factors, reflecting the important role of environment and upbringing alongside genetics ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3341646/#:~:text=The%20heritability%20of%20intelligence%20is,studies%20carried%20out%20in%20the)). It is also crucial to note that heritability does *not* mean a fixed destiny for an individual; it only describes variation across a group under current environments ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3341646/#:~:text=heritability,regard%20to%20sources%20of%20between)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3341646/#:~:text=Thus%2C%20heritability%20is%20not%20tantamount,there%20is%20no%20meaningful%20heritability)). A high heritability of, say, 70% indicates that 70% of the *differences* in intelligence among people are due to genetic differences in that context – it does not mean an individual’s intelligence is 70% “from genes” and 30% “from environment” in a simple way ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3341646/#:~:text=signifying%20no%20heritability%20at%20all,of)). Moreover, heritability can change if the environment changes or differs across groups ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3341646/#:~:text=Heritability%20has%20no%20fixed%20value,true%2C%20constant%20value%20for%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3341646/#:~:text=identical%20twins%20reared%20apart%20are,Most%20of%20the%20IQ)). With those caveats in mind, research consistently shows a strong hereditary component to intelligence, on the order of at least half by adulthood.

**Evidence from Twin and Adoption Studies:** The primary evidence for high heritability of intelligence comes from twin and adoption studies. Identical twins share essentially 100% of their genes, while fraternal twins (and ordinary siblings) share on average about 50%. If intelligence is strongly genetic, identical twins should have more similar IQ scores than fraternal twins or unrelated people raised in similar environments. This is exactly what studies find: for example, a large meta-analysis by Bouchard & McGue reported that **monozygotic (identical) twin pairs have a very high IQ score correlation (~0.86 when raised together)**, whereas biologically unrelated people tend not to have similar IQs ([www.medicalschool.tv](https://www.medicalschool.tv/genetics/heritability-of-iq-wikipedia/#:~:text=the%20general%20population,65)). Even more telling, identical twins *raised apart* (in different adoptive families) still show a high correlation in IQ (around 0.75 on average) ([www.medicalschool.tv](https://www.medicalschool.tv/genetics/heritability-of-iq-wikipedia/#:~:text=The%202006%20edition%20of%20Assessing,Plomin%20found%20that%20the%20IQ)). By contrast, non-twin siblings raised together have a lower IQ correlation (around 0.47), and adoptive siblings (who share environment but not genes) correlate near zero by adulthood ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5754247/#:~:text=When%20the%20interviewer%20interjected%20that,is%20likely%20to%20be%20incomplete)) ([www.medicalschool.tv](https://www.medicalschool.tv/genetics/heritability-of-iq-wikipedia/#:~:text=IQ%20scores%20between%20monozygotic%20twins,65)). In adoption studies, researchers often find that as children grow up, their IQ becomes **much more similar to the IQ of their biological parents** (with whom they share genes) and less correlated with the IQ of their adoptive parents ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5754247/#:~:text=When%20the%20interviewer%20interjected%20that,is%20likely%20to%20be%20incomplete)). Behavioral geneticist Robert Plomin noted that children adopted into new families tend to resemble their biological parents in IQ by adolescence just as much as children raised by their birth parents do, while the adoptive parents’ IQ has little long-term effect on the child’s IQ ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5754247/#:~:text=When%20the%20interviewer%20interjected%20that,is%20likely%20to%20be%20incomplete)). All of this evidence points to a strong inherited component in intelligence. In short, people who share more genes (like identical twins or biological parent-child pairs) tend to have more similar cognitive abilities, even when reared apart, compared to those who share fewer genes, implying that genetic differences play a major role in IQ variation ([www.medicalschool.tv](https://www.medicalschool.tv/genetics/heritability-of-iq-wikipedia/#:~:text=the%20general%20population,65)) ([www.medicalschool.tv](https://www.medicalschool.tv/genetics/heritability-of-iq-wikipedia/#:~:text=The%202006%20edition%20of%20Assessing,Plomin%20found%20that%20the%20IQ)).

**Variation with Age and Context:** The degree to which intelligence is hereditary is not a static number – it can vary with a person’s age and with their environment. Interestingly, genetic influences on IQ **increase with age**. In early childhood, IQ has a more modest heritability (some studies indicate only ~20–30% of variation in infancy is due to genes), but the genetic contribution grows as children get older ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25224258/#:~:text=special%20to%20intelligence%20differences%20and,30%20on%20average%20but)). By later childhood and adolescence, heritability rises to around 50–60%, and in adulthood genetic factors may account for as much as **70–80% of the variance in intelligence** ([webspace.ship.edu](https://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/iku.html#:~:text=changes%20with%20age%3A%20h,zero%20in%20some%20studies)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25224258/#:~:text=special%20to%20intelligence%20differences%20and,30%20on%20average%20but)). One reason for this pattern is that as people mature, they often seek out, select, or even create environments that match their genetic predispositions – a form of gene-environment correlation. Essentially, an individual’s innate aptitudes might lead them to experiences that further reinforce those aptitudes, amplifying genetic effects over time. Another crucial factor is the **socioeconomic and cultural context**: heritability estimates can differ across populations and environments ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3341646/#:~:text=cannot%20cleanly%20separate%20genetic%20from,out%20in%20nations%20within%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3341646/#:~:text=Heritability%20also%20varies%20as%20a,42)). For instance, psychologist Eric Turkheimer and colleagues found that in very impoverished conditions, the heritability of IQ can be much lower because almost all children face environmental disadvantages that limit the full expression of genetic potential ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3341646/#:~:text=Heritability%20also%20varies%20as%20a,42)). In one analysis, at the **lowest levels of socioeconomic status, environmental factors (like family and neighborhood conditions) explained almost all the variance in IQ**, while genetic differences explained very little; conversely, in wealthy families with very favorable environments, **genetic differences accounted for most of the IQ variance and the shared environment had virtually no effect** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3341646/#:~:text=Heritability%20also%20varies%20as%20a,42)). This means that if everyone has equally poor access to nutrition or education, those environmental deficits hold back many children regardless of genetic differences (lowering measured heritability), whereas in an environment where everyone has ample opportunities, individual genetic traits become the primary source of differences. Heritability also tends to be higher in populations where environmental differences are relatively small (for example, studies in more economically uniform groups or in certain countries showed higher heritability than studies in more diverse settings) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3341646/#:~:text=cannot%20cleanly%20separate%20genetic%20from,out%20in%20nations%20within%20the)). These findings underscore that “how hereditary” intelligence appears to be will depend on the range of environments: genes matter more when comparing people who grew up in broadly similar conditions, but in harsh or unequal environments, those environmental factors can swamp genetic influences.

**Environmental Influence and Malleability:** Importantly, saying intelligence has high heritability does **not** mean that IQ is fixed or unchangeable by the environment. There is clear evidence that environmental factors can have large effects on measured intelligence, especially when those environments change radically. One compelling example comes from **adoption studies**: children who start life in very disadvantaged or impoverished settings often show dramatic IQ improvements if they are adopted into more educated, nurturing, and resource-rich families. In a French study, researchers looked at a group of children who had extremely low IQ scores (averaging around 77) when living in neglectful, impoverished birth homes; after being adopted into well-off families, these children’s IQs jumped by adolescence – **gaining about 8 points on average when adopted by lower-middle-class families and roughly 18–20 points when adopted by high socioeconomic status families** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5754247/#:~:text=In%20a%20French%20adoption%20study%2C,them%20in%20perspective%2C%20a%20successful)). Such increases are quite significant (on the order of moving from below-average to roughly average IQ, or higher), illustrating that better nutrition, education, and intellectual stimulation in the new home substantially improved cognitive performance. Another adoption study in Sweden likewise found that children adopted by families with higher educational levels had higher IQs in adulthood (about 4–7 points higher on average) than their genetically identical siblings who stayed with less-educated biological parents ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5754247/#:~:text=Even%20in%20countries%20with%20very,the)). These cases show that enriching environmental inputs can raise an individual’s intelligence, especially if the early environment was deprived. On a broader scale, the **Flynn effect** is a phenomenon highlighting environmental impact: over the 20th century, average IQ scores worldwide increased dramatically (on the order of 2–3 points per decade in many countries) despite no genetic change in the population. This rise in IQ across generations is attributed to factors like improved childhood nutrition, better health care, more years of schooling and cognitive stimulation, and smaller family sizes, all of which enhance cognitive development ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5754247/#:~:text=heritability,The%20GE)). The fact that IQ scores have risen by the equivalent of 15+ points in a few generations shows that **population-wide intelligence levels can be lifted by environmental improvements**, even while genetic makeup remains the same. Likewise, early educational interventions and training can boost specific cognitive skills and sometimes reflect in IQ scores, especially in young children – though the durability of such gains can vary. In short, **high heritability does not mean immutability**: even though genes strongly influence where one’s intelligence might land relative to others, favorable environments can elevate a person’s cognitive abilities (and severe deprivation can harm them). Genes set the stage, but environment still directs much of the performance.

**Conclusion:** Research to date indicates that a substantial portion of intelligence is hereditary, with genetic differences often accounting for around half or more of the variation in IQ within a given population ([webspace.ship.edu](https://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/iku.html#:~:text=changes%20with%20age%3A%20h,zero%20in%20some%20studies)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3341646/#:~:text=The%20heritability%20of%20intelligence%20is,studies%20carried%20out%20in%20the)). By adulthood, the genetic contribution to intelligence differences can be very large (on the order of 70–80% in many studies), emphasizing that inherited DNA plays a major role in cognitive abilities ([webspace.ship.edu](https://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/iku.html#:~:text=changes%20with%20age%3A%20h,zero%20in%20some%20studies)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25224258/#:~:text=special%20to%20intelligence%20differences%20and,30%20on%20average%20but)). However, this does *not* mean that an individual’s intelligence is predetermined solely by genes – the environment remains crucial. The **remaining variance (20–30% or more)** is linked to environmental influences, and even highly heritable traits like IQ can be shaped by life experiences, education, nutrition, and societal factors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3341646/#:~:text=Heritability%20also%20varies%20as%20a,42)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5754247/#:~:text=heritability,The%20GE)). In favorable conditions, genetic potentials for intelligence can fully flourish, while in adverse conditions, even strong genetic endowments may be stifled. Thus, while a large part of intelligence is indeed hereditary, it is equally true that **environmental factors significantly affect developmental outcomes**, and interventions or improvements in environment can lead to meaningful changes in cognitive performance. In summary, intelligence emerges from a complex interplay of heredity and environment: **genes set important foundations for cognitive ability, and those genetic influences are powerful, but environment also matters greatly in realizing (or inhibiting) a person’s intellectual potential** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3341646/#:~:text=Because%20the%20value%20of%20a,over%20the%20past%20several%20generations)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3341646/#:~:text=Heritability%20also%20varies%20as%20a,42)).

It concluded that genetic factors account for about **45% of IQ variance in childhood** and roughly **75% by late adolescence**, with the remainder due to environmental influences ([webspace.ship.edu](https://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/iku.html#:~:text=changes%20with%20age%3A%20h,zero%20in%20some%20studies)). The authors emphasized that heritability is a population statistic and that high heritability does not mean intelligence is unchangeable (they noted, for instance, that average IQ scores can shift due to environment across generations).

He also discusses how heritability is not fixed, pointing out that it can vary with context – for example, **socioeconomic differences**: in **very impoverished settings, environmental limitations can suppress genetic advantages**, whereas in affluent settings, genetic differences explain more of the IQ variation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3341646/#:~:text=Heritability%20also%20varies%20as%20a,42)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3341646/#:~:text=Heritability%20also%20varies%20as%20a,42)). Overall, Sternberg stresses that genes and environment always work together in shaping intelligence.

A review by behavioral geneticists highlighting key insights about IQ inheritance. One notable “special finding” is that the **heritability of intelligence increases with age** – estimated at only about **20% in infancy** but rising to roughly **80% in later adulthood** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25224258/#:~:text=special%20to%20intelligence%20differences%20and,30%20on%20average%20but)). The authors also remark that intelligence is among the most heritable of human traits, yet identifying the specific genes involved has been challenging (the so-called “missing heritability” problem).

This article explores how intelligence can be **highly heritable (~0.8)** and yet still very **malleable**. Sauce and Matzel argue that gene–environment interplay (interaction and correlation) allows for high genetic influence while also enabling large environmental effects. They present evidence that **improving a child’s environment can substantially raise IQ** – for example, citing studies where children adopted from deprived orphanages into enriched homes gained **15–20 IQ points** on average ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5754247/#:~:text=In%20a%20French%20adoption%20study%2C,them%20in%20perspective%2C%20a%20successful)). They also discuss the **Flynn effect**, noting that societal developments (better nutrition, education, etc.) led to massive IQ gains over the 20th century ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5754247/#:~:text=heritability,The%20GE)), which demonstrates the potent impact of environment despite high genetic influence on individual differences.

5. **Bouchard & McGue (1981)** – *Review of IQ Correlations in Relatives* (summarized in Mackintosh, 2011 and elsewhere). A classic meta-analysis of family and twin studies which found that **closely related individuals have much more similar IQs** than those less related, supporting heredity’s role. For instance, identical twins showed an IQ correlation of about **0.86** (when raised together) and **0.75** (when raised apart), whereas biologically unrelated people raised in the same home had near-zero correlation ([www.medicalschool.tv](https://www.medicalschool.tv/genetics/heritability-of-iq-wikipedia/#:~:text=the%20general%20population,65)) ([www.medicalschool.tv](https://www.medicalschool.tv/genetics/heritability-of-iq-wikipedia/#:~:text=The%202006%20edition%20of%20Assessing,Plomin%20found%20that%20the%20IQ)). Siblings and fraternal twins were intermediate (~0.45–0.50 correlation). This pattern matches what genetic theory would predict and has been replicated in later studies (e.g. studies reported in *Assessing Adolescent and Adult Intelligence* by Kaufman & Lichtenberger (2006) observed very similar correlations ([www.medicalschool.tv](https://www.medicalschool.tv/genetics/heritability-of-iq-wikipedia/#:~:text=The%202006%20edition%20of%20Assessing,Plomin%20found%20that%20the%20IQ))). The reviewers concluded that a large portion of IQ variation is attributable to genetic differences, while also acknowledging that no single “IQ gene” is responsible – instead, many genes each contribute a small effect.
