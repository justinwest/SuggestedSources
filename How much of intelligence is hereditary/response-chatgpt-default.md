# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Short answer  
• In contemporary, well-nourished, industrialised populations, about 50 – 80 % of the differences in general intelligence (g) among adults can be traced to genetic variation.  
• In childhood the figure is lower (≈ 20 – 40 %), and it rises steadily with age, peaking in mid-adulthood.  
• These numbers are “heritability estimates,” not proportions of an individual’s IQ that come from genes. They describe how strongly genetic differences correlate with IQ differences in a particular population at a particular time.  
• The remaining variation (≈ 20 – 50 %) reflects environmental factors, measurement error, and gene–environment interplay.

Below is a detailed explanation.

1. What “heritability” means  
• Heritability (h²) is the ratio of genetic variance to total variance for a trait in a population.  
• It is not:  
  – A fixed property of the trait for all time and places.  
  – A statement that “X % of your IQ is genetic.”  
• Change the population or the environment and the estimate changes.

2. Main evidence: twin, adoption and family studies  
• Monozygotic (MZ) twins reared together correlate ≈ 0.80 in IQ; dizygotic (DZ) twins ≈ 0.50.  
• MZ twins reared apart average ≈ 0.70, indicating a large genetic contribution.  
• Adopted children resemble their biological parents in IQ more than they do their adoptive parents by late adolescence.  
• Meta-analyses of thousands of twin pairs produce heritability estimates roughly as follows:  
  – Preschool (2–5 yrs): 20–30 %  
  – Childhood (6–12 yrs): 40–50 %  
  – Adolescence: 50–60 %  
  – Adulthood: 60–80 %  
The increasing heritability with age is often termed the “Wilson Effect.”

3. Gene–environment interplay  
a) Gene–environment correlation (rGE)  
   • Passive: literate parents pass on both genes and book-filled homes.  
   • Evocative: brighter children elicit more cognitive stimulation from teachers.  
   • Active (niche-picking): as people age they choose environments that fit their genetic propensities.  
b) Gene × environment interaction (G×E)  
   • The same genotype can yield different IQ outcomes under deprivation vs enrichment.  
   • Example: Heritability of IQ in poor U.S. families is near zero, but can exceed 0.70 in affluent ones (Turkheimer et al., 2003).

4. Molecular genetics  
• Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using > 1 million people have identified thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with IQ and educational attainment, each with minuscule effect (≈ 0.01 IQ point).  
• Polygenic scores built from these SNPs predict up to 10–15 % of IQ variation in independent samples—consistent with, but well below, twin-study heritability (the “missing heritability” gap).

5. Environmental influences that matter  
• Prenatal factors: maternal nutrition, toxins, birth complications.  
• Early childhood: breastfeeding, diseases, lead exposure, responsive caregiving, language exposure.  
• Schooling quality and duration.  
• Macrosocial changes: the “Flynn Effect” (≈ 3 IQ points per decade rise worldwide in the 20th century) shows environment can shift average IQ quickly, even while heritability within a birth cohort remains high.

6. Limits and cautions  
• High heritability does not imply immutability. Height is ~80–90 % heritable, yet average height can change rapidly with nutrition.  
• Heritability says nothing about group differences unless environments are equal across groups—an assumption rarely met.  
• Estimates differ across cultures, socioeconomic strata, historical periods, and measurement methods.  
• Intelligence is not one number: specific abilities, creativity, motivation, and wisdom show somewhat different genetic and environmental profiles.

7. Consensus range  
Summarising large reviews (Plomin & von Stumm, 2018; Polderman et al., 2015; Bouchard, 2013):  
• Heritability of general intelligence:  
  – Childhood: roughly 0.30–0.45  
  – Adolescence: 0.45–0.65  
  – Adulthood (18–65): 0.60–0.80  
• Shared (family-wide) environment: fades from ~0.25 in early childhood to near zero by adulthood.  
• Non-shared environment & error: remainder (~0.20–0.40).

8. Practical takeaway  
Genetics set a probabilistic range, but life experiences, education, health, and social policies can still move individuals and whole populations within—and sometimes beyond—that range. The question “How much of intelligence is hereditary?” has an empirical answer (about half or more of the variation in many modern populations), but it does not diminish the leverage of good environments or the moral imperative to provide them.
