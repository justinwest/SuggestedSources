Short answer
- In wealthy, well-nourished populations, about 50–80% of the differences between adults in general cognitive ability (IQ/g) are attributable to genetic differences; in childhood the proportion is lower (roughly 20–40%), rising through adolescence (40–60%) into adulthood (60–80%) [1][2][3].
- These figures are heritability estimates: they describe how much of the variation within a particular population at a particular time is associated with genetic variation. They do not mean an individual’s intelligence is “fixed,” and they do not imply environmental factors are unimportant [1][12].

What “heritability of intelligence” means (and does not)
- It is a population-level statistic: heritability is the fraction of observed differences among people that is statistically linked to genetic differences in that specific context. Change the environment, the estimate can change [1][12].
- High heritability does not mean immutability. Traits can be highly heritable and still respond strongly to environmental changes (e.g., education, nutrition). The 20th-century “Flynn effect” shows large environmental shifts in average IQ despite substantial heritability [7].
- Within-group heritability says nothing about the causes of average differences between groups; those could be environmental, genetic, both, or neither. The evidence base strongly cautions against inferring group causes from within-group heritability [12].

What the evidence shows
1) Twin and adoption studies
- Classic twin studies consistently find substantial genetic influence on intelligence, with heritability increasing with age. A large multinational meta-analysis of 11,000 twin pairs found heritability rising from about 0.41 in childhood to 0.55 in adolescence and 0.66 in young adulthood, while shared family environmental effects decline over time [2]. Broad reviews converge on roughly 50% across the life course, often higher in adults in affluent settings [1][3].
- Adoption and family-based findings align: resemblance to biological relatives increases with age, while similarity to adoptive family members’ IQ wanes by adulthood, indicating diminishing shared environmental effects within families as people select and shape their own environments [9][1].

2) Socioeconomic context matters
- In early childhood, the heritability of IQ tends to be lower in disadvantaged environments, where constraints can limit the expression of genetic differences; an influential US study reported much lower heritability in low-SES families and much higher heritability in high-SES families [5].
- A meta-analysis across countries finds this “genes × SES” pattern is strong in the United States but is weak or absent in several other developed countries, underscoring that heritability depends on societal context (e.g., inequality, safety nets) [4].

3) DNA-based (molecular) evidence
- With measured DNA, “SNP-heritability” for intelligence is typically ~20–30% in European-ancestry samples, capturing the additive effects tagged by common variants; this is a lower bound on total heritability estimated from twin designs [1][10][11].
- Large genome-wide association studies show intelligence is highly polygenic (influenced by many genetic variants of very small effect), and current polygenic scores explain a modest share of variance compared to twin-based heritability [10][11][1].

Environmental influences and malleability
- Education has a causal effect on cognitive test performance: quasi-experimental evidence suggests roughly 1–5 IQ points per additional year of schooling, with effects persisting into later life [6].
- Remediating early deprivation can produce large gains. Children adopted from severely deprived environments into more advantaged homes show substantial IQ increases (often on the order of 7–20 points, depending on the quality of the adoptive environment) [8].
- Societal changes have shifted average IQ scores by about 3 points per decade across much of the 20th century (Flynn effect), further demonstrating strong environmental leverage at the population level [7].

Why estimates differ
- Age: heritability tends to increase from childhood into adulthood as people increasingly select, modify, and create environments correlated with their genetic propensities (gene–environment correlation) [2][1].
- Environment: greater environmental uniformity tends to raise heritability; greater inequality or deprivation can lower it, especially in childhood [5][4].
- Methods and measures: twin/adoption methods estimate total genetic influence; DNA-based methods capture only the portion tagged by measured common variants and so yield lower estimates [1][10][11].
- What is measured: different cognitive batteries, emphasis on general intelligence (g) versus specific abilities, and measurement reliability all influence estimates [1][12].

Bottom line
- In many contemporary, high-resource populations, about half to three quarters of individual differences in adult intelligence test scores are heritable, with lower estimates in childhood. These figures coexist with strong, demonstrable environmental effects from education, early-life conditions, and societal change. Heritability quantifies sources of variation within a given context; it does not set limits on what individuals or policies can achieve.
