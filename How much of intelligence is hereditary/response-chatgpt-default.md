# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

How much of intelligence is hereditary?  
A precise percentage valid for everyone does not exist, but decades of behavioral-genetic and molecular-genetic research allow us to give a well-supported, nuanced answer.

─────────────────────────────────────────
1.  What “heritable” means (and what it doesn’t)
─────────────────────────────────────────
•  Heritability (h²) is a statistic that describes the proportion of the observed variation in a trait, in a particular population at a particular time, that is attributable to genetic differences between individuals.  
•  It is not the portion of an individual’s intelligence that comes from genes, nor is it a fixed, immutable constant.  
•  Heritability says nothing about group differences that arise when populations are raised in systematically different environments.

─────────────────────────────────────────
2.  Methods used to study the question
─────────────────────────────────────────
•  Twin & adoption studies: compare monozygotic (MZ) twins, dizygotic (DZ) twins, biological siblings reared together/apart, and adoptees.  
•  Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and polygenic scores: aggregate millions of DNA variants to predict small increments of IQ variance.  
•  Longitudinal designs across developmental stages.  
•  Natural-experiment designs (e.g., differences in schooling, social policy shifts).

─────────────────────────────────────────
3.  Consensus estimates across the life span
─────────────────────────────────────────
Below are rough ranges for developed nations with relatively high educational access. (Less-advantaged contexts usually show lower heritability because environmental differences loom larger.)

Age 0–3 years:   20–30 %  
Middle childhood: 40–50 %  
Late adolescence: 50–60 %  
Adulthood (25+):  60–80 %  

Why the rise with age?  
•  Gene–environment correlation: With maturity people increasingly select and shape environments that fit their genetically influenced preferences (“niche-picking”), amplifying genetic variance.  
•  Universal schooling in early years compresses environmental differences, then later occupational and lifestyle freedom widens them.

─────────────────────────────────────────
4.  Key moderating factors
─────────────────────────────────────────
Socioeconomic status (SES)  
•  U.S. data show heritability of IQ can be as low as 0.10–0.20 in poor families and 0.70+ in affluent families (Turkheimer et al., 2003).  
•  In northern Europe, with stronger social safety nets, that SES moderation is weaker or absent.

Prenatal & early-life health  
•  Nutrition, lead exposure, infections, and perinatal insults can depress measured IQ independently of genes.

Education & cognitive stimulation  
•  Extra years of schooling raise IQ 1.5–3 points per year.  
•  Intensive early-childhood programs produce lasting gains in life outcomes, though the IQ boost itself often fades.

Culture and historical period  
•  The Flynn effect (≈3 IQ points per decade through much of the 20th century) shows large environmental shifts can raise population IQ despite static gene pools.

─────────────────────────────────────────
5.  Findings from molecular genetics
─────────────────────────────────────────
•  Intelligence is highly polygenic: each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) contributes roughly one-millionth of the variance.  
•  Current polygenic scores built from >1 000 associated loci explain ~10–15 % of IQ variance in European-ancestry samples—well below twin-study estimates but steadily increasing as sample sizes grow.  
•  A sizeable share of the twin-study heritability remains “missing” at the measured-DNA level, likely due to rare variants, gene–gene interactions, and imprecise measurement.

─────────────────────────────────────────
6.  Limitations & common misconceptions
─────────────────────────────────────────
•  High heritability does NOT mean immutability: height is 80–90 % heritable, yet population average height rose ~10 cm in a century through better nutrition.  
•  Heritability within groups cannot be extrapolated to explain differences between groups who experience different environments.  
•  Genetic influence is probabilistic, not deterministic; it operates through interaction with context.

─────────────────────────────────────────
7.  Bottom-line synthesis
─────────────────────────────────────────
1.  In contemporary, relatively affluent societies, genetic differences account for roughly half to three-quarters of the individual variation in adult intelligence.  
2.  The genetic share is smaller in early childhood and in environments with high deprivation.  
3.  Environment still matters profoundly: eliminating poverty, improving prenatal care, enhancing education, and reducing toxins can raise cognitive performance substantially even when heritability is high.  
4.  Genes and environment constantly interact; intelligence is shaped by an ongoing dialogue between the two, not by a simple additive split.

So, while we can say that a large fraction—often 50–70 % in adulthood—of the variability in IQ scores within well-resourced populations is “heritable,” this figure neither diminishes the importance of enriching environments nor fixes an individual’s intellectual potential.
