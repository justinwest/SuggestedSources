# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Intelligence shows substantial genetic influence, but how large that influence is depends on what exactly is measured, how it is measured, the age of the people tested, and the population and environment in which they live. Current behavioral-genetic and molecular-genetic evidence can be summarized as follows.

1. What “heritability” means  
• Heritability (h²) is the proportion of observed differences (variance) in a trait within a particular population that can be attributed to genetic differences in that population.  
• It is a population statistic, not an individual one. A heritability of 60 % does not mean 60 % of a person’s intelligence is genetic; it means 60 % of the IQ differences among the people studied can be statistically linked to genetic variation.  
• Heritability is not fixed. It changes when environments or gene pools change.

2. How heritability of intelligence is estimated  
• Classic twin and adoption studies compare identical (MZ) twins, fraternal (DZ) twins, biological siblings, adoptive siblings, and unrelated individuals raised together or apart.  
• Newer genome-wide association studies (GWAS) use hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to calculate “SNP heritability” and polygenic scores.  
• Both approaches converge on broadly similar figures, though each has limitations (e.g., assortative mating, unequal environments for MZ twins, “missing heritability”).

3. Typical heritability estimates across the life span (Western industrialized samples)  
Approximate mid-range values from meta-analyses:

• Early childhood (2–6 yr): 20–30 %  
• Middle childhood (7–12 yr): 40–50 %  
• Adolescence (13–18 yr): 50–60 %  
• Young to middle adulthood (18–50 yr): 60–80 %  
• Older adulthood (65+ yr): declines somewhat, ~50–60 %

Thus, in affluent, relatively homogeneous societies, heritability rises from roughly one-quarter in toddlers to roughly two-thirds in adults.

4. Why heritability increases with age  
• Children grow into environments they select or evoke based on their genetic propensities (gene–environment correlation).  
• Schooling, friendships, and occupational niches increasingly allow people to express their inherited abilities.  
• Shared family environment (parenting style, neighborhood, household resources) has its strongest impact early on and fades with age.

5. Environmental and social modifiers  
• Socioeconomic status (SES): In low-SES contexts, heritability can be much lower (even near zero) because adverse conditions mask genetic potential; in higher-SES contexts, it rises.  
• Education quality and duration, nutrition, exposure to toxins, disease burden, stress, and trauma all depress or enhance the expression of genetic potentials.  
• The secular “Flynn effect” (average IQ gains of ~3 points per decade in many countries during the 20th century) shows that large environmental shifts can alter population intelligence despite high heritability estimates.

6. Molecular-genetic findings  
• Thousands of common genetic variants each contribute tiny effects; known SNPs currently explain about 20–25 % of IQ variance in European-ancestry samples.  
• Rare variants, structural variants, epigenetic modifications, and gene–gene interactions likely account for additional “missing” heritability.  
• Polygenic scores can predict 10–15 % of individual IQ differences but are less accurate outside the populations in which they were derived.

7. Common misconceptions  
• High heritability does not mean intelligence is “innate” or immutable. Height is ~80 % heritable, yet average height has changed by over 10 cm in some nations within a century.  
• Heritability does not inform us about group differences (e.g., between ethnic groups or nations) because environmental and genetic backgrounds differ simultaneously.  
• Genetic influence is probabilistic, not deterministic; many high-IQ people carry alleles associated with lower IQ and vice versa.

8. Bottom line  
In modern, relatively well-nourished, industrial societies, about half to three-quarters of the variation in adult intelligence—averaging around 60–70 %—can be traced to genetic differences. Early in life, genes account for less, shared environment accounts for more, and adverse environments can greatly dampen genetic expression. Intelligence is best understood as the product of many genes interacting continuously with diverse and changeable environments.
