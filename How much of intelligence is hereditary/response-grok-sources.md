# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Intelligence, often measured as IQ (intelligence quotient), is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Research indicates that heredity plays a significant role in determining intelligence, though the exact extent varies depending on the context, age, and environmental conditions. Below is a detailed examination of the hereditary component of intelligence based on the provided sources.

Studies on twins and family pedigrees have been instrumental in estimating the heritability of intelligence. Heritability, in this context, refers to the proportion of variance in intelligence that can be attributed to genetic differences among individuals. According to research summarized in Scientific American, heritability estimates for intelligence range from 50% to 80% in adulthood, with the influence of genetics becoming more pronounced as individuals age [1]. This suggests that while environmental factors, such as education and socioeconomic status, are crucial in early development, genetic factors increasingly account for differences in intelligence over time.

A comprehensive review published in Nature Reviews Genetics supports this view, emphasizing that intelligence is a highly polygenic trait, meaning it is influenced by many genetic variants, each with small effects. The review highlights that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic loci associated with intelligence, and heritability estimates derived from these studies often fall around 50% [2]. However, the authors also note that these estimates can vary based on the population studied and the methods used, underscoring the complexity of pinning down an exact figure.

Additionally, a meta-analysis available on PubMed reinforces the significant genetic contribution to intelligence. It reports that heritability estimates for IQ are approximately 50% in childhood, increasing to 70-80% in adulthood, consistent with the idea that genetic influences become more prominent as environmental effects stabilize or diminish over time [3]. The study also acknowledges the role of gene-environment interactions, where genetic predispositions may be amplified or suppressed by environmental conditions.

It is important to note that heritability does not imply that intelligence is entirely fixed or predetermined. Even with high heritability, environmental factors such as access to education, nutrition, and parental support can significantly shape cognitive outcomes. Moreover, heritability estimates apply to populations, not individuals, meaning they describe group-level variance rather than the potential of any single person.

In conclusion, based on the reviewed sources, intelligence is substantially hereditary, with estimates of genetic contribution ranging from 50% to 80%, depending on age and context [1][2][3]. While genetics play a critical role, environmental influences remain essential, particularly in early life, and the interplay between genes and environment continues to be a key area of research.
