# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Intelligence, often measured as IQ (intelligence quotient), is a complex trait influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The question of how much of intelligence is hereditary has been a topic of extensive research in psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. Studies consistently show that genetics play a significant role in determining intelligence, but the exact proportion of heritability and the mechanisms behind it remain subjects of ongoing investigation. This response synthesizes findings from the provided sources and additional research to provide a comprehensive overview of the hereditary component of intelligence.

Heritability is a statistical measure that estimates the proportion of variation in a trait within a population that can be attributed to genetic differences. For intelligence, heritability estimates typically range from 50% to 80%, depending on the population studied, the age of the individuals, and the methods used to assess intelligence [1][2]. This means that roughly half to three-quarters of the differences in intelligence among individuals can be explained by genetic factors, while the remainder is influenced by environmental factors such as education, socioeconomic status, and upbringing.

Twin and adoption studies have been instrumental in establishing the heritability of intelligence. Identical twins, who share nearly all their DNA, tend to have more similar IQ scores than fraternal twins, who share only about 50% of their DNA. A meta-analysis of longitudinal twin and adoption studies found that the heritability of cognitive ability increases with age, from about 41% in childhood to as high as 66% in adulthood [3]. This suggests that genetic influences on intelligence become more pronounced as individuals grow older, possibly because they have more control over their environments and can select contexts that align with their genetic predispositions [3].

Recent advances in genomics, particularly genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have identified specific genetic variants associated with intelligence. A large-scale meta-analysis involving 269,867 individuals identified numerous genetic loci linked to intelligence, explaining approximately 5-10% of the variance in IQ [4]. While this is a small fraction compared to heritability estimates from twin studies, it reflects the polygenic nature of intelligence—meaning it is influenced by thousands of genetic variants, each with a tiny effect [5]. The gap between GWAS findings and twin study estimates, often called the "missing heritability," is likely due to rare genetic variants, gene-environment interactions, and limitations in current genetic sequencing technologies [2][6].

Environmental factors, while not the focus of this question, are critical to understanding the full picture of intelligence. Even with high heritability, non-genetic factors such as access to education, nutrition, and parental involvement can significantly shape cognitive outcomes. Importantly, heritability does not imply that intelligence is fixed or unchangeable; it simply describes the proportion of variation due to genetics in a specific population at a specific time [1].

There are also nuances in how heritability is interpreted across different contexts. For instance, studies of polygenic scores (which aggregate the effects of many genetic variants) within and between sibling pairs show that genetic predictions of intelligence and educational attainment are more accurate within families than across unrelated individuals, highlighting the role of shared environments in amplifying or mitigating genetic effects [7]. Additionally, some researchers caution against overemphasizing genetic contributions, noting that the interplay between genes and environment is complex and not fully understood [8].

In conclusion, intelligence is substantially hereditary, with estimates suggesting that 50-80% of the variation in IQ can be attributed to genetic factors. Twin and adoption studies provide strong evidence for this, while genomic research continues to uncover the specific genetic mechanisms involved. However, the influence of environment remains significant, and the dynamic interaction between genes and environment shapes cognitive abilities throughout life. Future research is needed to close the gap in missing heritability and to better understand how genetic and environmental factors interact to influence intelligence.
