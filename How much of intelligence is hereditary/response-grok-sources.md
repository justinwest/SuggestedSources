# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Intelligence, often measured as IQ or cognitive ability, has long been a subject of debate regarding the extent to which it is influenced by genetics versus environmental factors. Research over the past few decades has provided substantial evidence that heredity plays a significant role in determining intelligence, though the exact proportion and mechanisms remain complex and intertwined with environmental influences. This response explores the current scientific understanding of the heritability of intelligence, drawing from the provided sources and additional research where necessary.

Heritability is a statistical measure that estimates the proportion of variation in a trait within a population that can be attributed to genetic differences. For intelligence, studies consistently suggest that heritability ranges from 50% to 80% in adulthood, with the influence of genetics increasing as individuals age [1][2]. Twin and adoption studies, which compare the similarity of intelligence between identical twins (who share nearly all their DNA) and fraternal twins (who share about 50% of their DNA), have been instrumental in establishing these estimates. For instance, a meta-analysis of longitudinal twin and adoption studies found that the heritability of cognitive ability increases across development, from about 41% in childhood to as high as 66% in adulthood [3]. This suggests that while early environmental factors like parenting and education play a significant role in childhood, genetic influences become more pronounced over time [3].

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have further advanced our understanding by identifying specific genetic variants associated with intelligence. A large-scale meta-analysis involving 269,867 individuals identified numerous genetic loci linked to cognitive performance, explaining a small but significant portion of the variance in intelligence [4]. These findings indicate that intelligence is polygenic, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genetic variants, each contributing a tiny effect [5]. However, even with these advances, the identified genetic markers account for only a fraction of the heritability estimated from twin studies—a phenomenon known as the "missing heritability" problem [6].

Environmental factors, while not the focus of this question, cannot be ignored. They interact with genetic predispositions in complex ways, a concept known as gene-environment interaction. For example, socioeconomic status, education, and nutrition can amplify or suppress genetic potential for intelligence [1][7]. Some researchers argue that the increasing heritability with age may partly reflect how individuals select environments that align with their genetic predispositions, a process known as gene-environment correlation [2].

Despite the strong evidence for genetic contributions, there are caveats. Heritability estimates apply to populations, not individuals, and do not imply that intelligence is fixed or unchangeable [1]. Moreover, the study of intelligence genetics raises ethical concerns about misuse or misinterpretation of findings, such as reinforcing stereotypes or justifying inequality [6]. Recent research also emphasizes that while polygenic scores (predictions of intelligence based on genetic data) show promise, their predictive power remains limited, especially when applied across different populations or even within sibling pairs [8].

In conclusion, intelligence is substantially hereditary, with genetic factors accounting for 50% to 80% of variation in adulthood, as evidenced by twin studies, adoption studies, and genomic research. However, the interplay between genes and environment remains critical, and much of the genetic basis of intelligence is still not fully understood due to the complexity of polygenic traits and missing heritability. Ongoing research continues to refine these estimates and uncover the intricate mechanisms behind cognitive ability.
