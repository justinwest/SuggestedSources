Intelligence is a complex trait influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The question of how much of it is hereditary often refers to *heritability*, a statistical concept that estimates the proportion of variation in intelligence (typically measured by IQ or cognitive ability tests) within a population that can be attributed to genetic differences among individuals. Importantly, heritability does not mean that intelligence is fixed or predetermined; it reflects the relative contribution of genetics in a specific environment and population, and it can change across contexts or lifespans. It also does not imply that the remaining portion is solely environmental, as gene-environment interactions play a role. Based on extensive research from twin studies, adoption studies, and modern genomic analyses, heritability estimates for intelligence generally range from 40% to 80%, with variations depending on age, measurement methods, and populations studied [1][2][4]. Below, I break this down comprehensively, drawing on the suggested sources and a few additional high-quality references for completeness and accuracy.

### Estimates from Behavioral Genetic Studies
Traditional studies, such as those involving twins and adoptees, provide the foundational evidence for intelligence's heritability. These compare identical (monozygotic) twins, who share nearly 100% of their DNA, with fraternal (dizygotic) twins, who share about 50%, or compare adopted children with their biological and adoptive parents.

- **Overall Heritability Range**: Meta-analyses of twin and family studies suggest that genetics account for approximately 50% of the variance in intelligence in adulthood, though estimates can reach as high as 80% in some populations [1][2]. For instance, a comprehensive review in *Nature Reviews Genetics* highlights that heritability increases from about 20-40% in early childhood to 60-80% in adulthood, a phenomenon known as the "Wilson effect" where genetic influences become more pronounced as individuals age and shape their own environments [2][4].
  
- **Age-Related Changes**: Longitudinal studies confirm that heritability is lower in infancy and early childhood (around 20-30%) but rises steadily. By adolescence, it often exceeds 50%, and in adulthood, it can approach 80% [4][9]. This increase is attributed to gene-environment correlations, where genetically influenced traits lead individuals to seek out environments that amplify those traits (e.g., a child with high genetic potential for cognition might pursue more intellectually stimulating activities) [4][10].

These estimates are population-specific and can vary by socioeconomic status or cultural context. For example, in environments with high inequality, environmental factors may play a larger role, reducing apparent heritability [1].

### Insights from Molecular Genetics
Advances in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and polygenic scoring have moved beyond broad heritability estimates to identify specific genetic variants associated with intelligence. These methods scan millions of DNA markers to find correlations with cognitive traits.

- **GWAS Findings**: A large-scale meta-analysis of over 269,000 individuals identified hundreds of genetic loci linked to intelligence, explaining about 5-10% of the variance in cognitive ability [3]. More recent reviews suggest that polygenic scores—composite measures of many small genetic effects—can predict up to 10-15% of intelligence differences within populations [5][6][7]. However, this is far below the 50-80% from twin studies, indicating a "missing heritability" gap, where unidentified genetic factors or complex interactions may account for the rest [5][10].

- **Within-Family Evidence**: Studies comparing siblings (who share family environments but differ genetically) show that polygenic scores predict intelligence differences, supporting a causal genetic role. For example, research on sibling pairs found that genetic scores explain about 4-7% of variance in cognitive abilities from childhood to adulthood, with stability over time [8]. This helps rule out confounding environmental factors like shared upbringing [8][10].

- **Limitations and the "Big Deal or Much Ado" Debate**: While GWAS have identified real genetic links, critics argue the predictive power is modest and overhyped. A meta-analysis in *Intelligence* concluded that DNA-based predictions for IQ are statistically significant but explain only a small fraction (around 5-10%) of variance, cautioning against overinterpreting them for individual predictions [6]. Environmental influences, such as education, nutrition, and socioeconomic status, remain crucial and can interact with genetics (e.g., via epigenetics) [1][2].

### Broader Considerations and Caveats
Heritability is not destiny; even with high genetic contributions, interventions like quality education can significantly boost cognitive outcomes [1]. Intelligence is polygenic, involving thousands of genes each with tiny effects, and it's influenced by rare mutations or de novo variants [5][7]. Moreover, definitions of "intelligence" vary (e.g., general cognitive ability vs. specific skills), affecting estimates [9]. Cross-cultural studies suggest heritability may be lower in resource-poor environments, emphasizing the interplay between genes and surroundings [2].

In summary, while genetics play a substantial role—accounting for roughly 50% of intelligence variance on average, and up to 80% in adulthood—the exact figure depends on context. Molecular studies are closing the gap but highlight that much remains unexplained. For a more precise personal assessment, genetic testing is not yet reliable, and environmental factors offer significant opportunities for enhancement [1][3][6]. Additional sources, such as a review in *Psychological Bulletin* [11] and a book chapter on behavioral genetics [12], reinforce these findings by synthesizing global twin data and emphasizing gene-environment dynamics.
