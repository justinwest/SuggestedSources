# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Intelligence, often measured as IQ or cognitive ability, is a complex trait influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Research over the past few decades has sought to quantify the extent to which intelligence is hereditary, with studies consistently showing that genetics play a significant role, though the exact proportion and mechanisms remain subjects of ongoing investigation. This response explores the heritability of intelligence, drawing on the provided sources and additional research to provide a comprehensive overview.

Heritability is a statistical measure that estimates the proportion of variation in a trait within a population that can be attributed to genetic differences. For intelligence, twin studies, adoption studies, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been instrumental in estimating this figure. Research suggests that heritability of intelligence ranges from 50% to 80% in adulthood, with the influence of genetics increasing as individuals age [1][2][4]. This phenomenon, often referred to as the "increasing heritability" of intelligence, indicates that while environmental factors such as upbringing and education play a critical role in early childhood, genetic factors become more prominent in shaping cognitive abilities over time [4].

Twin and adoption studies have provided some of the earliest and most robust evidence for the heritability of intelligence. Identical twins, who share nearly all their DNA, tend to have more similar IQ scores than fraternal twins, who share only about 50% of their DNA, even when raised in different environments [1][4]. A meta-analysis of longitudinal twin and adoption studies highlights that heritability estimates for cognitive ability increase from approximately 40% in childhood to 60-80% in adulthood, suggesting that genetic influences become more pronounced as environmental effects stabilize or diminish with age [4].

Advancements in genetic research, particularly through GWAS, have further illuminated the specific genetic underpinnings of intelligence. These studies analyze large populations to identify genetic variants associated with cognitive ability. A landmark meta-analysis involving 269,867 individuals identified numerous genetic loci linked to intelligence, demonstrating that it is a highly polygenic trait—meaning it is influenced by thousands of small-effect genetic variants rather than a single "intelligence gene" [3]. Additionally, research published in *Molecular Psychiatry* emphasizes that genetic variation not only influences intelligence directly but also interacts with brain structure and function, providing a biological basis for cognitive differences [5].

However, the heritability of intelligence does not imply that it is entirely fixed or predetermined. Environmental factors such as socioeconomic status, education, nutrition, and parenting style significantly shape cognitive development, especially in early life [1][2]. For instance, studies note that while genetic factors account for a substantial portion of intelligence variation, environmental interventions can still have meaningful impacts, particularly in mitigating disparities caused by adverse conditions [7]. Moreover, the interaction between genes and environment—known as gene-environment interplay—complicates the picture, as certain genetic predispositions may only manifest under specific environmental conditions [2][7].

Recent research also explores the predictive power of polygenic scores, which aggregate the effects of multiple genetic variants to estimate an individual’s genetic predisposition for a trait like intelligence. Studies on sibling pairs and longitudinal cohorts suggest that while polygenic scores can predict cognitive abilities and educational outcomes to some extent, they are far from deterministic and must be interpreted alongside environmental contexts [8]. Critics of genetic determinism, as discussed in a meta-analysis in *Intelligence*, caution against overinterpreting genetic data, arguing that the practical significance of DNA-based predictions for IQ remains limited and often overstated in public discourse [6].

In conclusion, intelligence is substantially hereditary, with genetic factors accounting for 50-80% of variation in cognitive ability in adulthood, as evidenced by twin studies, adoption studies, and genomic research. However, environmental influences and gene-environment interactions remain critical, particularly in childhood. While advances in genetics have deepened our understanding of the biological basis of intelligence, they also underscore the complexity of this trait and the importance of a balanced perspective that considers both nature and nurture.
