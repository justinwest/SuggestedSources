# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Intelligence, often measured as IQ (intelligence quotient), is a complex trait influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The question of how much of intelligence is hereditary has been a topic of extensive research in psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. Studies consistently show that genetics play a significant role in determining intelligence, but the exact proportion of heritability and the mechanisms behind it remain subjects of ongoing investigation. This response synthesizes findings from the provided sources and additional research to provide a comprehensive overview of the hereditary component of intelligence.

Heritability is a statistical measure that estimates the proportion of variation in a trait within a population that can be attributed to genetic differences. For intelligence, heritability estimates typically range from 50% to 80%, depending on the age of the individuals studied and the methods used. A widely cited figure from twin and adoption studies suggests that about 50% of the variation in intelligence among individuals is due to genetic factors in adulthood, with the influence of genetics increasing as people age [1][4]. This increase in heritability over time is thought to occur because individuals, as they grow older, have more control over their environments and may select settings that align with their genetic predispositions, a phenomenon known as gene-environment correlation [4].

Twin studies, which compare the similarity of intelligence between identical (monozygotic) twins, who share nearly all their DNA, and fraternal (dizygotic) twins, who share about 50% of their DNA, have been instrumental in estimating heritability. These studies consistently show that identical twins have more similar IQ scores than fraternal twins, supporting a strong genetic influence [1][4]. Adoption studies further corroborate this by demonstrating that adopted children’s IQs correlate more closely with their biological parents than with their adoptive parents over time [4].

Recent advances in genomics, particularly genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have identified specific genetic variants associated with intelligence. A large-scale meta-analysis involving over 269,000 individuals identified numerous genetic loci linked to intelligence, explaining a small but significant portion of the variation in IQ [3]. However, these genetic variants collectively account for only about 5-10% of the heritability of intelligence, a discrepancy often referred to as the "missing heritability" problem [2][3]. This suggests that intelligence is highly polygenic, meaning it is influenced by thousands of genetic variants, each with a tiny effect, as well as complex interactions between genes and the environment [2][5].

Environmental factors, such as socioeconomic status, education, nutrition, and parenting, also play a critical role in shaping intelligence, particularly in early childhood when heritability estimates are lower (around 20-30%) [1][4]. As individuals age, the influence of shared environmental factors (those common to siblings raised in the same household) tends to decrease, while genetic factors become more prominent [4]. This dynamic interplay between genes and environment underscores that intelligence is not solely hereditary but rather the result of a complex interaction between the two.

Moreover, polygenic scores, which aggregate the effects of many genetic variants to predict traits like intelligence, have shown promise in explaining differences in cognitive abilities within and between sibling pairs. However, these scores still capture only a fraction of the genetic contribution to intelligence, and their predictive power varies across populations and contexts [8]. Additionally, meta-analyses of genetic studies emphasize that while DNA plays a role in IQ, the effect sizes of individual genetic markers are small, and environmental influences remain crucial in understanding the full picture of intelligence [6].

It is also important to note that heritability estimates apply to populations, not individuals. A heritability of 50-80% does not mean that 50-80% of an individual’s intelligence is "inherited"; rather, it indicates the proportion of variation in intelligence across a population that can be attributed to genetic differences [1]. Misinterpretations of heritability can lead to oversimplified views of intelligence as a fixed or predetermined trait, ignoring the significant role of environment and personal experiences.

In conclusion, research suggests that intelligence is substantially hereditary, with genetic factors accounting for approximately 50-80% of the variation in IQ in adulthood, though this estimate varies by age and context. Advances in genetics have begun to uncover specific genetic contributions to intelligence, but much of the heritability remains unexplained due to the trait’s polygenic nature and the intricate interplay with environmental factors. Understanding intelligence as a product of both nature and nurture is essential for interpreting these findings and applying them to educational and social contexts.
