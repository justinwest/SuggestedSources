# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Twin, adoption and molecular‐genetic studies all agree that intelligence (usually measured as general cognitive ability or “g ”) is substantially influenced by inherited DNA differences, but the exact proportion depends on the age of the people studied, the method used to estimate it, and the social context.

1. What the classical family and twin studies show  
   • In early childhood about 40–50 % of the variation in IQ is heritable.  
   • Heritability rises through adolescence and peaks in adulthood at roughly 70–80 %.  
   • In old age it drops slightly but usually remains above 60 %.  
   These values come from dozens of twin-, sibling- and adoption studies summarised by behavioural geneticists [1] [2].

2. What DNA-based (molecular) studies show  
   • When the same people’s genotypes are examined directly, the common SNPs measured on today’s arrays account for about 15–30 % of IQ differences (so-called SNP-heritability) [2] [3].  
   • Polygenic scores built from those SNPs currently predict ~10–15 % of the variance in independent samples, far less than the twin-based figure because the scores capture only a fraction of the total genetic variation [3] [5].

3. Why the numbers differ  
   • Twin studies pick up the effect of all inherited variants (including rare ones and gene–gene interactions).  
   • SNP studies only include the common variants that have been genotyped, so they give a lower bound.  
   • As sample sizes grow, SNP-heritability and the predictive power of polygenic scores are rising steadily [5][6].

4. Gene × environment considerations  
   • Heritability is a population statistic, not a fixed property of an individual.  
   • It can fall in environments that are highly unequal or stressful; for example, studies in very low-SES U.S. samples find heritability well below 50 %.  
   • The upward trend across the life span is thought to reflect “gene–environment correlation”: as people grow up they increasingly select, create or stay in environments that fit their genetic propensities.

5. A succinct answer  
   In contemporary Western populations, roughly one-half of the differences in children’s intelligence and about two-thirds or more of the differences in adults’ intelligence can be traced to genetic factors. The remaining variation is attributable to environmental influences and measurement error. Current DNA analyses capture only part of this genetic contribution, but that proportion is rising as genomic methods improve.
