Short answer
- In contemporary, well-resourced populations, about half to two-thirds of the differences among adults in general intelligence (g) are attributable to genetic differences (roughly 50–70%). In early childhood it is much lower (about 20–40%), rising steadily through adolescence into adulthood [2], [4], [1], [5].

What “heritable” means (and does not mean)
- Heritability is a population-level statistic: it is the proportion of observed differences between people that are associated with genetic differences in a given place and time. It is not about an individual, not fixed across environments, and does not mean a trait cannot be changed by education, health, or policy [1], [2].

Evidence
1) Family-based studies (twins, adoptees)
- Meta-analyses of twin and adoption data show a developmental increase in heritability of cognitive ability: low in infancy (~20%), moderate in childhood (~40–50%), and higher in adulthood (~60% on average, sometimes higher), with shared-family environmental influences typically declining with age [4], [2]. A widely cited summary for adults is “about 50%,” with some cohorts closer to two-thirds [1], [2], [5].

2) DNA-based estimates and predictions
- SNP-heritability (the share of variance captured by common measured variants) for intelligence is typically around 20–30%, lower than twin-based estimates because it misses rare variants, structural variants, and some non-additive effects [2], [3], [5].
- Polygenic scores (PGS) built from genome-wide association studies now predict a nontrivial but still modest fraction of individual differences in cognitive performance and related traits:
  - Between unrelated people: often 5–15% of variance depending on the measure and cohort, smaller for pure IQ than for education [2], [3], [6].
  - Within families (e.g., between siblings, controlling for shared background): predictive power persists but is attenuated, commonly on the order of a few percent for IQ/cognitive tests, larger for education [7], [6]. This confirms genuine genetic signal while highlighting the importance of environmental and developmental pathways.
- Large GWAS have identified hundreds of loci associated with cognitive performance, reinforcing that intelligence is highly polygenic (influenced by very many variants of very small effect) and biologically plausible via brain-related pathways [3], [5], [2].

Why heritability rises with age
- As people grow up, they increasingly select, modify, and create environments correlated with their genetic propensities (gene–environment correlation). This amplifies genetic differences over time while shared family influences typically wane, raising heritability estimates from childhood into adulthood [4], [2]. At the same time, rank-order differences in general cognitive ability show meaningful stability from early life onward, which gives such influences room to accumulate [8].

Important caveats
- Context matters: heritability depends on the range of environments in the studied population. Broadening environmental variation (e.g., through inequality or deprivation) can lower heritability; reducing it (e.g., universal schooling, improved health) can raise heritability even as absolute levels change [1], [2], [4].
- Genetics is not destiny: environmental interventions, education, health, and policy can shift cognitive development and outcomes despite substantial heritability [1], [2].
- Current DNA-based predictors are less accurate outside the ancestries on which they were trained; portability is an active area of research and ethics [2], [5].
- Heritability says nothing about differences between groups; it is about variation within a population under specific conditions [1], [2].

Bottom line
- A reasonable summary is: in adulthood, roughly 50–70% of variation in general intelligence within typical Western samples is heritable; in early childhood it is closer to 20–40%, rising with age due to gene–environment interplay. Molecular genetics confirms substantial but incomplete genetic influence, with DNA-based predictors explaining a modest share of the variance and steadily improving as studies grow [2], [4], [3], [6], [7], [5].
