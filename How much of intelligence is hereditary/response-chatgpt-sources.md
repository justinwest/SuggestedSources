# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

How heritable is intelligence?

1. What “heritability” means  
   • Heritability is a statistic that describes what proportion of the differences (variance) in a trait within a particular population can be traced to genetic differences, given the environments the members of that population have experienced. It does not describe how fixed an individual’s intelligence is, nor does it tell us what would happen if the environment changed [1].

2. Estimates from classical twin-, family- and adoption studies  
   • Dozens of studies over the past half-century converge on the finding that roughly 50 % of the observed variation in general cognitive ability (often called g or IQ) in industrialised countries is attributable to genetic differences when childhood and adolescence are averaged together [1][2].  
   • Heritability is not static over the life span. It tends to be lower in early childhood (≈20–30 %), rises through adolescence (≈40–60 %) and can reach about 70–80 % by late adulthood, as people increasingly select and shape environments that match their genetic inclinations (so-called gene–environment correlation) [1][2].

3. Evidence from molecular genetics  
   • Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that directly measure DNA variation now identify thousands of common variants that, in aggregate, account for 20–25 % of the variance in intelligence; when combined with family data, these molecular estimates converge on the classical twin-study figure of roughly 50 % heritability [2][3].

4. What the numbers do (and do not) imply  
   • A heritability of 50–80 % does not mean that intelligence cannot be improved. Heritability can be high even when environmental interventions have large effects, because the statistic applies only to variation that exists under current conditions.  
   • Heritability differs across time, place and socioeconomic context. In societies with greater environmental inequality, the proportion of IQ variance tied to environment can be larger; in more homogeneous environments, genetic differences can explain more of the remaining variation [1].

5. Bottom line  
   • In contemporary, economically developed populations, about half of the observable differences in intelligence are attributable to inherited genetic variation in childhood, rising to something like two-thirds or more by adulthood. The environment still matters, and heritability says nothing about the potential benefits of educational, nutritional or social interventions.
