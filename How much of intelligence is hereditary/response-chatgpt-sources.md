# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Extent of heritability  
“Heritability” is the proportion of the differences that we observe between people that can be traced to genetic differences in a given population at a given time; it does not mean that a fixed share of any individual’s intelligence is pre-set.  Twin, adoption and molecular-genetic studies converge on the following picture:

1.   Infancy: about 20 % of the variation in cognitive ability is genetic.  
2.   Middle childhood: ~40–50 %.  
3.   Adolescence: ~60 %.  
4.   Young to late adulthood: as high as 70–80 % in well-nourished, schooled societies.  [1] [2]

DNA that has been directly measured (so-called “SNP heritability”) accounts for a smaller fraction—roughly 20 % of the IQ variation in large genome-wide studies—with current polygenic scores explaining about 5–10 %.  The gap between these molecular estimates and the 70–80 % figure from twin studies represents genetic influences that are still unidentified or poorly tagged by today’s genotyping arrays. [2] [3]

Why heritability changes  
•  Gene–environment correlation: as people age they increasingly select, modify and create environments that fit their genetically influenced preferences, amplifying genetic effects. [2]  
•  Environmental equalisation: in populations where nutrition, health care and schooling are relatively uniform, environmental variance shrinks, so genetic variance necessarily accounts for a larger slice of what remains. [1]  

Limits of heritability  
High heritability does not imply immutability.  Average IQ scores have risen dramatically during the last century (the “Flynn effect”), showing that population-wide environmental changes can move the whole distribution even when heritability is high.  Moreover, heritability estimates can drop in settings marked by poverty, malnutrition or educational inequality, where environmental differences are larger. [1]

Bottom line  
Across modern industrialised populations, roughly half to three-quarters of the individual differences in intelligence are attributable to genetic variation, with the genetic proportion rising from childhood into adulthood.  At the DNA level we can currently account for about one-fifth of that variance, and the rest reflects genetic factors still to be discovered as well as gene–environment interplay. [1] [2] [3]
