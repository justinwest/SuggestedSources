# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Researchers usually talk about “the heritability of intelligence,” meaning the proportion of the differences in IQ that can be traced to genetic differences within a particular population at a particular time.  It is not the percent of any one person’s intelligence that is “caused” by genes, nor does it say anything about the mutability of IQ.  With that in mind, the best-supported figures are:   

1. Childhood: 20 – 40 % of the variance in IQ is genetic.  
2. Adolescence: ≈ 50 %.  
3. Adulthood: 60 – 80 %.  

Why the range?

• Age matters.  A meta-analysis of 11 000 sibling pairs showed heritability rising from .41 at age 9 to .66 by age 17, and twin data show it continuing upward into the mid-20s [4].  
• Environment matters.  In impoverished or highly unequal settings, genetic variation explains less and environmental variation explains more; in more advantaged settings the reverse holds [1].  
• Method matters.  Twin/adoption studies capture almost all genetic effects (broad-sense heritability), while DNA-based methods capture only the additive effects tagged by common SNPs (so-called SNP-heritability).  Recent genome-wide association studies of ~270 000 people find SNP-heritability of 20–25 %, while twin designs on the same samples yield 50–70 % [2][3][5].  

Putting the lines of evidence together, most behavior-genetic reviews converge on the statement that “about half or a little more” of the population variance in general cognitive ability is inherited in childhood, climbing to roughly two-thirds by adulthood.  The remaining third (and during childhood, the majority) is environmental—shared influences such as family SES, schooling, and nutrition, and non-shared influences such as peer groups, illnesses, accidents, and idiosyncratic life events.  

Key take-aways

• Genes clearly matter for intelligence, but they are not destiny; environmental change can still raise or lower IQ.  
• The percentage is population-specific and can shift if environments become either more uniform (heritability rises) or more disparate (heritability falls).  
• Modern DNA scores can already predict 10–20 % of IQ differences, but that is still far from the ~60 % ceiling set by twin data, showing that much genetic influence remains to be mapped.
