# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

**Evidence for Genetic Influence on Intelligence:** Decades of twin and adoption studies show that a large portion of the variance in human intelligence (as measured by IQ tests) is due to genetic factors. On average, about 50% of the differences in intelligence among individuals can be attributed to hereditary (genetic) differences, with the remaining 50% driven by environmental influences and random life events [1]. This means that while genes have a substantial impact on intelligence, they do not account for everything – environment matters roughly equally in shaping a person’s cognitive abilities [1]. Notably, the genetic contribution to intelligence isn’t fixed across the lifespan: heritability tends to **increase with age**. In childhood, only around 40% of IQ variation might be explained by genetics, but by late adolescence and adulthood, genetic influences strengthen – accounting for roughly 60–70% (or even higher in some studies) of the variance in intelligence [4]. Researchers believe this rise is due to gene–environment interactions: as people grow up, they increasingly select, modify, and evoke environments that correspond to their genetic predispositions (for example, a child with an inherited aptitude for learning might seek out extra reading or educational opportunities, further boosting their cognitive skills) [4]. In support of the strong hereditary effect, adoption studies find that by adulthood, adopted children’s IQs correlate much more with the IQs of their biological parents than with those of their adoptive parents – evidence that genes outweigh adoptive family environment in the long run [1]. At the same time, the fact that identical twins raised together are far more similar in intelligence than non-related individuals (and more similar than fraternal twins) underscores a genetic effect, but they are **not** perfectly identical in IQ, emphasizing that non-genetic factors also play a role [1][4]. In short, a significant portion of intelligence is **heritable**, but genetics work in tandem with environmental factors throughout development.

**Genetic Basis: Polygenic Effects and Gene Discoveries:** Modern molecular genetics has reinforced these findings and begun to unravel which genes are involved. Intelligence is **highly polygenic**, meaning it is influenced by many thousands of genetic variants each exerting a small effect rather than any single “intelligence gene” [2]. Early genome-wide association studies (GWAS) had difficulty finding DNA markers for IQ because each gene’s impact is tiny, but with very large sample sizes, researchers are now identifying specific genetic loci linked to cognitive ability. For example, a 2018 meta-analysis of GWAS data on around 270,000 individuals uncovered **205 genomic regions** (loci) associated with intelligence test performance, implicating over 1,000 genes in total [3]. These discoveries confirm that genetic influences on IQ are spread across the genome and involve genes related to brain development and neural function [3]. Importantly, the identified gene variants only explain a fraction of intelligence’s variability. Statistical analyses indicate that all common genetic variants together (the overall “SNP heritability” from DNA data) account for roughly 20–30% of the variance in IQ, which is substantial but still below the ~50% heritability estimated from twin studies [2][5]. The gap between twin-study heritability and known DNA-based heritability represents the so-called “missing heritability.” Recent work has made progress on this front – the 2018 GWAS findings of dozens of new genes *collectively* explain about **20% of intelligence’s heritability** (equivalent to roughly 10% of the total IQ variance) [2]. This is a significant step forward, as earlier genetic scores could only predict around 1% of IQ variation, but it also means the majority of the genetic factors underlying intelligence remain to be discovered. In practice, even the best current polygenic score (an index summarizing someone’s genetic propensity for higher IQ based on known variants) predicts only a **modest portion** of an individual’s intelligence. By 2017, such scores explained on the order of 4–7% of the variance in independent samples’ IQ scores [2], and a comprehensive 2024 meta-analysis confirmed that DNA-based predictions of IQ are still very limited in accuracy – only a few percent of IQ differences are captured by these genetic scores in most cases [6]. In other words, while intelligence is clearly influenced by genetics, our ability to **predict** an individual’s exact IQ from their DNA alone is currently small (though it’s improving as more genetic variants are identified). The polygenic nature of intelligence also means it overlaps genetically with other traits: many of the genetic influences on IQ are shared with factors like educational attainment, and genetic studies find correlations between intelligence and outcomes such as health or mental disorders (e.g. certain gene variants associated with higher IQ also associate with lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease and some psychiatric conditions) [3][5]. These findings highlight that intelligence arises from a complex genetic architecture that affects brain development and cognitive efficiency in diverse ways.

**Environmental Influences and Gene–Environment Interplay:** Crucially, saying that intelligence is partly hereditary **does not** mean that IQ is fixed or solely determined by genes. The roughly 50% of variation *not* explained by genetics points to the powerful role of environment and individual life experiences [1]. Factors such as prenatal conditions, nutrition, education quality, home stimulation, socioeconomic status, and even random life events (like illnesses or injuries) contribute to shaping one’s cognitive abilities. For example, severe early-life deprivation or exposure to toxins can impair intellectual development regardless of a child’s genetic potential, whereas enriching educational and social environments can help a person maximize their innate abilities. Genetics and environment often work together in complex ways: people’s genes can influence the kind of environments they experience (as noted earlier, a genetically curious child might read more, further boosting IQ), and conversely, certain environments can moderate how strongly genetic potentials are expressed. There is evidence that in very disadvantaged settings, the heritability of IQ is lower (because harmful environments hold back children’s cognitive development across the board), while in more advantaged settings, genetic differences have freer rein to emerge, making IQ appear more heritable in high-resource contexts [4][5]. Furthermore, **within-family studies** underscore both genetic effects and environmental effects on intelligence. A recent study examined polygenic scores in siblings and found that the sibling with a higher genetic score for intelligence tends to score higher on cognitive tests than their brother or sister with a lower score – a clear indication that genetic differences directly contribute to IQ differences even among children raised in the same family [7]. However, the same study noted that the predictive power of genes *within* families was only about half as strong as the genetic prediction observed across unrelated people [7]. In other words, two siblings might differ in IQ partly due to their genetic differences, but not as much as two random people with the same genetic difference, because siblings share many aspects of their environment. This finding suggests that **between-family environmental factors** (like differences in parenting, schools, or socio-economic advantages between families) also account for a substantial portion of IQ differences when comparing the broader population [7]. The influence of family environment tends to wane as children grow up (which is why adoptive siblings become less alike in IQ over time), but it certainly leaves its mark in early years, and some environmental effects (such as educational opportunities or cultural values about learning) can have lasting impacts. 

In summary, intelligence is the result of a **complex interplay between hereditary and environmental factors**. Estimates vary, but roughly **half or more** of the variation in IQ across the population is attributable to genetic differences, according to numerous studies [1][2]. This makes general cognitive ability one of the more heritable traits in psychology. At the same time, a large remaining portion is shaped by non-genetic influences – highlighting that high heritability does not mean intelligence is immutable or solely “in your genes.” Modern genetic research confirms that there is no single gene for intelligence; instead, many hundreds or thousands of genes each contribute a tiny amount to one’s cognitive ability, and together these inherited factors set broad potential ranges. How close individuals come to fulfilling that potential can depend on environmental conditions like nutrition, education, and practice. In practical terms, **both nature and nurture are significant**: your DNA may give you a head start (or present some challenges) in cognitive aptitude, but personal experiences and learning opportunities critically determine where you end up within your genetic potential. The consensus in the scientific community is that **intelligence is a polygenic, highly heritable trait – but not a predestined one** [1][5]. Genetics explains a lot of why people differ in IQ, and recent advances are starting to pinpoint the biological underpinnings of intelligence, yet environmental factors remain essential in shaping those genetic predispositions into real-world ability. In short, a meaningful part of intelligence is hereditary, but it is far from the whole story – **both genes and environment matter profoundly** in making us who we are [1][5].

He notes that this 50% heritability means the other half of IQ variation is caused by environmental factors. Plomin highlights evidence like adopted children resembling their biological parents in IQ by adulthood, underlining the strong genetic influence while also emphasizing that environment (illness, schooling, etc.) can significantly affect an individual’s realized intelligence. *Source:* *“Is Intelligence Hereditary?”* **Scientific American** (2016) – [Link](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-intelligence-hereditary/). 

2. **Plomin & von Stumm (2018) – *Nature Reviews Genetics***: This article reviews the “new genetics” of intelligence, confirming that intelligence is *highly heritable* (around 50% by twin studies) and summarizing recent genomic findings. The authors report that polygenic scores derived from DNA now predict a few percent of intelligence variation (around 4% in 2017, improved from ~1% earlier) and that combining data from IQ and educational attainment GWAS can predict over 10% of variance – which is over 20% of intelligence’s 50% heritability. In other words, by 2018 researchers had identified genetic variants accounting for roughly **20% of the genetic influence** on intelligence (about 10% of total IQ variance), demonstrating real progress in solving the “missing heritability.” They stress that intelligence is influenced by thousands of DNA variants of small effect, and that polygenic scores are unique causal predictors that exist from birth, even though current scores leave much heritability unexplained. *Source:* *“The new genetics of intelligence”* **Nature Reviews Genetics** 19(3):148–159 (2018) – [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2017.104) (review article summarizing advances in genetics of IQ).

(2018) – *Nature Genetics***: A large-scale GWAS meta-analysis of 269,867 individuals, which identified **205 genetic loci** (190 of them new discoveries) associated with intelligence. This study reinforced that intelligence has a polygenic genetic architecture and made a big leap in uncovering specific genes linked to cognitive ability. The associated genes were found to be enriched in brain tissues and involved in neural development pathways. Despite finding many new loci, the authors noted that much of intelligence’s heritability remains unexplained – the identified variants collectively accounted for only part of the genetic component (the study’s results suggested known loci explain roughly 5–7% of IQ variance, which is a subset of the total heritability). The paper also reported genetic correlations between intelligence and various health outcomes (for example, genetic propensity for higher IQ was found to correlate with lower risk of Alzheimer’s and ADHD), illustrating the shared genetic influences between cognitive ability and other traits. *Source:* *“Genome-wide association meta-analysis in 269,867 individuals identifies new genetic and functional links to intelligence”* **Nature Genetics** 50(7):912–919 (2018) – [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29942086/) (research article reporting new genetic loci for IQ).

4. **Briley & Tucker-Drob (2013) – *Psychological Science***: A meta-analysis of longitudinal twin and adoption studies examining how the **heritability of cognitive ability changes with age**. They found that genetic influences on intelligence *increase* as children grow up. For instance, one synthesis highlighted by the authors showed heritability rising from about **41% at age 9 to 66% by age 17**. Another analysis indicated heritability around 55% in early teenage years climbing to ~70% by young adulthood. The paper discusses mechanisms for this increase, proposing that early in life “new” genetic effects come into play (innovation) and, as development progresses, initial genetic differences get amplified through gene–environment transactions (children gravitate toward experiences that reinforce their genetic strengths). Concurrently, shared family environmental effects (the influence of being raised in the same home) decline with age. This meta-analysis helps explain why adult IQ is more strongly genetic than childhood IQ, and underscores that genes and environments interplay over time. *Source:* *“Explaining the Increasing Heritability of Cognitive Ability Across Development: A Meta-analysis of Longitudinal Twin and Adoption Studies”* **Psychological Science** 24(9):1704–1713 (2013) – [Link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3954471/) (study showing that heritability of intelligence rises from childhood to adulthood).

5. **Deary et al. (2021) – *Molecular Psychiatry***: A comprehensive review of research on genetic variation, brain, and intelligence differences. The authors (Deary, Cox, Hill, and colleagues) summarize a decade of findings from molecular genetics and neuroimaging. They reaffirm that intelligence differences are *substantially heritable* and report on advances in DNA-based heritability estimates and GWAS discoveries. They also review studies linking brain structure and function to intelligence (for example, associations between IQ and cortical thickness or white matter integrity), as well as how certain gene variants relate to brain measures. The review emphasizes that while progress has been made in identifying genetic and neurological correlates of IQ, the observed associations are generally **modest** – reflecting the complexity of the trait. In other words, many genes and biological factors each contribute a small amount. The authors call for integrated research (combining genetics and brain imaging) to unravel the mechanisms by which genes influence cognitive ability. *Source:* *“Genetic Variation, Brain, and Intelligence Differences”* **Molecular Psychiatry** 27(1):335–353 (2022) – [Link](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01027-y) (review article highlighting that intelligence has significant genetic underpinnings and identifying neural correlates, while noting the small effect sizes of individual genetic/brain factors).

6. **Oxley et al. (2024) – *Intelligence***: A meta-analysis titled “DNA and IQ: Big deal or much ado about nothing?” which critically examines how well current polygenic scores actually predict intelligence. The authors (Oxley, Wilding, von Stumm) aggregated results from studies using the polygenic score derived from the 2018 GWAS by Savage et al. They found that the DNA-based predictions of IQ are **modest in size** – explaining only a small fraction of IQ variance in practice. This suggests that, despite the high heritability of intelligence, the specific genetic markers identified so far have limited predictive power for individuals. The meta-analysis underscores that much of the genetic influence is still “hidden” (owing to many undiscovered variants or complex gene–gene and gene–environment interactions) and cautions against overstating what genetic tests can currently tell us about someone’s intelligence. In sum, it’s a “big deal” scientifically that DNA plays a role in IQ, but from a practical standpoint, known genetic scores are not yet very predictive (hence “much ado about nothing” for individual prediction). *Source:* *“DNA and IQ: Big Deal or Much Ado About Nothing? – A Meta-analysis”* **Intelligence** 107 (Nov–Dec 2024): 101871 – [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289624000655) (study showing that polygenic scores for intelligence have only weak to moderate predictive accuracy).

7. **Y. Lin et al. (2025) – *Intelligence & Cognitive Abilities***: This study analyzed **polygenic score prediction within and between sibling pairs** to disentangle genetic effects from family environmental effects on intelligence and related traits. By comparing the predictive power of IQ polygenic scores at the population level (among unrelated individuals) versus within families (between dizygotic twins/siblings), the researchers found that the within-family genetic effect on intelligence is real but smaller. Specifically, the variance in IQ explained by the polygenic score was roughly **half as large within sibling pairs** as it was in the general population. For example, if the polygenic score explained ~8% of IQ variance in unrelated people, it explained only ~4% of the difference between siblings on average. This reduction implies that some of the predictive power of genetic scores in the population comes from differences **between families** (factors like assortative mating and socio-economic differences correlated with genetics). After adjusting for family socio-economic status, the gap between within-family and between-family genetic effects narrowed for educational traits, suggesting that part of what makes some families have higher IQ (and education levels) than others is linked to socio-economic advantages that go hand-in-hand with genetics. The study’s takeaway is that genes do cause differences in intelligence even among people raised in the same home (demonstrating a direct hereditary effect), but family environment also contributes to differences between families. *Source:* *“Polygenic score prediction within and between sibling pairs for intelligence, cognitive abilities, and educational traits from childhood to early adulthood”* **Intelligence & Cognitive Abilities** (2025) – [Link](https://icajournal.scholasticahq.com/article/140654-polygenic-score-prediction-within-and-between-sibling-pairs-for-intelligence-cognitive-abilities-and-educational-traits-from-childhood-to-early-adul) (research article showing that genetic predictions of IQ hold within families, though more weakly than across the population, highlighting environmental influences).
