# How much of intelligence is hereditary?

Intelligence is **substantially influenced by genetics**, though it is far from 100% predetermined by DNA. Behavioral genetic research over the past century – including **twin, family, and adoption studies** – has consistently found that about **50% of the variation** in IQ (general cognitive ability) across a population can be attributed to genetic differences among individuals [1][2]. In other words, about half of the *measured* differences in people’s intelligence are associated with what they inherit from their biological parents, and the remaining half is due to non-genetic factors (environment and individual experiences) [1]. Notably, this 50% figure is an average estimate for the population; it **can vary with age and context**. In early childhood, IQ heritability is lower – some studies estimate only around 20–30% in toddlers and young children – but it **increases as children grow** [1][5]. By adolescence and adulthood, heritability rises to **around 50–70%** (meaning genetic factors may account for well over half of the variance in adult intelligence test scores in many samples) [1][5]. This age-related rise in heritability has been observed in longitudinal studies: for example, one analysis found that the genetic contribution to cognitive ability went from roughly **40% in late childhood to about 66% by late adolescence** [4]. Scientists theorize that as people mature, they often seek out, select, or **shape their own environments in ways that amplify their genetic propensities** (“nature via nurture”). A child with genes favoring higher intelligence might, for instance, gravitate toward books, learning opportunities, and intellectually stimulating friends, which in turn further boosts their cognitive skills – reinforcing the genetic influence over time [1]. This feedback loop may explain why **family environment effects on IQ are strongest in childhood and tend to fade by adulthood**, while genetic effects become more pronounced ([www.scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-intelligence-hereditary/#:~:text=Another%20particularly%20interesting%20recent%20finding,fully%20develop%2C%20their%20genetic%20propensities)) ([icajournal.scholasticahq.com](https://icajournal.scholasticahq.com/article/140654-polygenic-score-prediction-within-and-between-sibling-pairs-for-intelligence-cognitive-abilities-and-educational-traits-from-childhood-to-early-adul#:~:text=heritability%20and%20twin%20heritability%20is,From)).

The substantial heritability of intelligence is demonstrated by classic studies. **Identical twins**, who share virtually all their genes, have much more similar IQ scores than fraternal twins, who share on average only half their segregating genes, pointing to a genetic effect. Likewise, **adoption studies** find that by adulthood, adopted children’s IQ scores are *much* more strongly correlated with the IQ of their *biological* parents (with whom they share genes but not upbringing) than with that of their adoptive parents (with whom they share home environment but not genes) [1]. In fact, adults who were adopted at birth tend to resemble their biological parents in intelligence as much as individuals raised by their biological parents do ([www.scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-intelligence-hereditary/#:~:text=Genes%20make%20a%20substantial%20difference%2C,resemble%20one%20another%20in%20intelligence)). Meanwhile, the IQ similarity between adoptive parents and their adopted children approaches zero in adulthood ([www.scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-intelligence-hereditary/#:~:text=Genes%20make%20a%20substantial%20difference%2C,resemble%20one%20another%20in%20intelligence)). This striking result underscores the **enduring impact of heredity**: even when children are reared in different families, their inherited genetic tendencies strongly influence their cognitive outcomes [1]. *However, “heritable” does not mean “immutable” or that environment doesn’t matter* – **environmental influences are also crucial**, especially early in life. A heritability of ~50% **still leaves the other ~50% of the variance explained by non-genetic factors** [1]. Factors such as **nutrition, prenatal health, exposure to toxins, quality of education, family socio-economic status, parenting styles, and life experiences** can significantly affect an individual’s intellectual development [1][5]. For example, improvements in these factors over time have produced the **“Flynn effect”** – the massive rise in average IQ scores during the 20th century – illustrating that **broad environmental changes can raise cognitive performance across entire populations** in just a generation or two ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8960418/#:~:text=of%20these%20wrong%20%28Carroll%29%20,The%20book%20was%20strongly)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8960418/#:~:text=Individual%20differences%20in%20human%20intelligence%2C,of%20genetic%20loci%20associated%20with)). (Notably, this Flynn effect has occurred even as within each generation the relative IQ differences remain strongly heritable, suggesting that genes set a potential range but overall societal/environmental improvements can lift everyone within that range [5].) In short, genes set the stage for one’s cognitive potential, but a **nurturing environment is needed to fully realize (or hinder) that potential**. Extreme deprivation (or enrichment) can push an individual’s realized IQ toward the lower (or upper) bounds of their genetic range, which is why ensuring a healthy, stimulating environment is so important in childhood.

Modern **molecular genetics has corroborated** the findings from twin studies, while also shedding light on *how* genes influence intelligence. Research shows that intelligence is a **highly polygenic trait**, meaning it is affected by **many thousands of genetic variants, each with a small effect** on cognitive abilities [1][2]. There is no single “intelligence gene.” In recent years, increasingly large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying specific gene variants linked to intelligence. For example, a 2018 GWAS meta-analysis of ~270,000 people (one of the largest studies to date) pinpointed **205 genetic loci** (regions of the genome) associated with intelligence test performance, implicating around **1,000+ genes** in total ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6411041/#:~:text=Intelligence%20is%20highly%20heritable,regions%20and%20associations%20with%20146)). Many of these genes are involved in brain development and neural function – the study found that the associated gene set is **enriched in brain tissue**, particularly in neurons related to learning and memory (such as hippocampal and striatal neurons) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6411041/#:~:text=association%20study%20of%20intelligence%20to,We%20confirm%20previous%20strong%20genetic)). This aligns with neurobiological research showing that **people with higher IQs tend to have certain brain differences** (e.g. slightly greater cortical thickness or efficient neural processing), and genetic variants may partly drive those brain characteristics ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8960418/#:~:text=Brain%20grey%20matter%20and%20intelligence,across%20areas%20cited%20by%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8960418/#:~:text=Individual%20differences%20in%20human%20intelligence%2C,of%20genetic%20loci%20associated%20with)). The discovery of hundreds of DNA markers for intelligence is a **major step forward** in understanding the biology of cognitive differences [3]. It also confirms that the genetic architecture of IQ is exceedingly complex: **each variant by itself typically has only a tiny effect on IQ (often raising or lowering IQ by a fraction of a point)**, but collectively their influence adds up [1][3]. This complexity meant that early candidate-gene studies struggled to find reliable “IQ genes.” In fact, older studies could only explain a few percent of IQ variation with the genetic variants they found, highlighting a lot of “**missing heritability**” [1]. Thanks to huge sample sizes and better methods, recent GWAS efforts have begun to account for more of this heritable variance. When the thousands of small genetic effects are **aggregated into a polygenic score** (a single index representing one’s genetic propensity for higher IQ), they can **predict a meaningful, though moderate, portion of a person’s intelligence**. By 2018, the identified genetic variants (still only a subset of all those involved) could statistically account for roughly **20% of the *heritability*** of IQ – in other words, about **10% of the total variance** in IQ scores – when combined into an index [2]. More recent analyses using polygenic scores report that the correlation between an individual’s polygenic score and their actual IQ is around **0.24 (on average)** in people of European ancestry, which implies the score explains about **5–6% of the variance** in intelligence in new samples [6]. This is a **significant progress** – a decade ago, DNA data could explain practically 0% of IQ differences, and now we can predict a small but non-trivial part of someone’s cognitive ability from their genes alone [6]. Still, the majority of the genetic influence remains “missing” in the sense that we haven’t identified all the relevant variants yet, and genetic prediction for individuals is **far from perfect** (many genetically “high-potential” people might score below average and vice versa, due to the myriad non-genetic factors involved) [2][6]. The current polygenic scores are most useful for research and understanding group trends; they are **not destiny for individuals**. They do, however, reaffirm that **DNA differences contribute substantially to intelligence**, since people with higher IQs *tend* (in a statistical sense) to carry more of the IQ-associated genetic variants identified so far [6].

Crucially, **heritability is a population-level statistic** – it describes *what proportion of variation* in a given group is due to genes *under the current range of environments*. It **does not mean** “50% of your IQ comes from your genes and 50% from your upbringing” in an absolute sense. Rather, a heritability of ~0.5 implies that *in the studied population*, if one person has a higher IQ than another, about half of that difference can be traced to genetic differences on average. Heritability can change if the environment changes. For instance, if everyone received exactly equal educational opportunities and upbringing (making environmental variation very small), then genetic differences would account for a *larger* fraction of the remaining IQ variation (potentially raising heritability). Conversely, in an environment where some people face severe educational deprivation and others do not, environmental factors could loom larger and **reduce the proportion attributable to genes**. In fact, studies suggest heritability of IQ can be lower in disadvantaged settings, where uneven opportunities suppress children’s ability to reach their genetic potential ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8960418/#:~:text=Heritability%C2%A0describes%20the%20proportion%20,of)). The key point is that genes and environment **always work together** to shape intelligence. Even highly heritable traits are not fixed – *they are malleable within the limits of biology*. As evidence, consider that **large environmental interventions** (like improved nutrition, adoption from a neglectful orphanage into a stimulating family, or intensive early childhood education programs) **can markedly raise a child’s IQ**, especially if started early – even though genetic predispositions still have an influence on how far each individual can progress. Thus, a high heritability **does not negate the importance of environment**. It simply means that in our society as it stands, genetic differences are a major reason why people differ in IQ. But *changing the environment* (for example, reducing childhood lead exposure or improving schools) can improve outcomes for everyone, often lifting those at the lower end more dramatically.

Another nuance is that **“genetic” influences on intelligence can be direct or indirect**. Genes not only affect our brain development directly; they can also **influence the environments we experience**, in subtle ways. For example, smarter and more educated parents pass on genes for higher intelligence to their kids, but those parents *also* tend to provide more cognitively stimulating home environments (books, complex vocabulary, learning opportunities, etc.). This phenomenon is sometimes called **genetic nurture** – the parent’s genes affect the child’s IQ partly via the environment the parent creates, not just via the genes the child inherits. Such indirect pathways can make the overall genetic effect on a trait appear larger, because genetic advantages (like having academically inclined parents) often come bundled with environmental advantages. Recent research using polygenic scores and family data suggests that for traits like education and intelligence, these **between-family genetic effects** (assortative mating, socio-cultural inheritance, etc.) do play a role ([icajournal.scholasticahq.com](https://icajournal.scholasticahq.com/article/140654-polygenic-score-prediction-within-and-between-sibling-pairs-for-intelligence-cognitive-abilities-and-educational-traits-from-childhood-to-early-adul#:~:text=The%20prediction%20of%20behavioral%20traits,the%20level%20of%20the%20individual)) ([icajournal.scholasticahq.com](https://icajournal.scholasticahq.com/article/140654-polygenic-score-prediction-within-and-between-sibling-pairs-for-intelligence-cognitive-abilities-and-educational-traits-from-childhood-to-early-adul#:~:text=the%20earliest%20DNA%20studies%20of,However%2C%20in%20twin%20studies)). For instance, one study found that a genetic score for educational achievement predicts kids’ outcomes much more strongly *between* different families than it does *within* the same family – implying that part of what the score captures is family-level factors correlated with genetics (like educated families providing better schooling) [7]. Even so, when scientists **control for family background by looking at siblings**, they still find a meaningful genetic signal: the sibling with a higher polygenic score for intelligence tends, on average, to develop a **higher IQ than their co-sibling** with a lower score [7]. This within-family prediction, albeit weaker than the between-family prediction, confirms that **genes exert a genuine influence on intelligence independent of family environment**. In other words, even among brothers and sisters raised together, those who happen to inherit more “favorable” gene variants for cognitive ability usually end up a bit smarter than their siblings who received fewer of those variants – illustrating that the effect of DNA is real and not solely an artifact of environmental confounds [7].

Finally, it’s worth noting that intelligence does not act in isolation. **Life success and cognitive achievements** result from a combination of mental ability *and* other traits (such as creativity, curiosity, work ethic, persistence, mental health, etc.), many of which also have genetic components. For example, a study of UK students found that **genetic factors underlying personality, motivation, and behavior** also contribute to academic performance, alongside intelligence [8]. In that analysis, intelligence was the single strongest genetic predictor of GCSE exam scores at age 16, but **other genetically influenced traits collectively accounted for about as much of the heritability in school performance as IQ did** ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1408777111#:~:text=Certificate%20of%20Secondary%20Education%20%28GCSE%29,in%20education%20toward%20personalized%20learning)) ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1408777111#:~:text=GCSE%20results%2C%20and%20these%20correlations,influenced%20traits%2C%20not%20just%20intelligence)). This means the **high heritability of outcomes like educational achievement reflects an interplay of multiple traits**, not just raw intelligence [8]. It underlines that while IQ is important, attributes like diligence, curiosity, anxiety levels, or social skills – which are partly heritable as well – can affect one’s learning and test performance. Therefore, someone’s genes might influence their academic success through many pathways: *via* cognitive ability *and* via non-cognitive factors that help or hinder learning [8].

**In summary**, research converges on the view that intelligence is **substantially hereditary** – **genes account for roughly half (or more) of the variability** in IQ in the population [1][5]. This genetic contribution grows stronger with age and with optimized environments, indicating that what we inherit forms the foundation of our cognitive potential. **Crucially, however, heritability is not destiny**. A large portion of what we call “intelligence” is shaped by environment, development, and individual circumstances. Even highly gifted children need supportive environments to reach high achievement, and children dealt a genetic disadvantage can often be helped to improve. **Both nature and nurture are fundamental**: genes set certain potentials and inclinations, while environment determines how fully those potentials are realized. The consensus of experts is that intelligence arises from a complex interplay of many genes (each contributing a small effect) and many environmental influences. So, to answer the question, **intelligence is indeed partly hereditary – approximately 50–70% heritable by adulthood under typical conditions – but that leaves a substantial 30–50% (or more in some contexts) determined by environmental factors and random life events** [1][5][8]. Our genes give us a range, and our experiences decide *where* within that range we end up.

He notes that genes **“make a substantial difference, but they are not the whole story,”** since roughly 50% of the variation is environmental. The article highlights that IQ heritability **increases with age** (around 20% in infancy, 40% in childhood, **60% in adulthood**), possibly because people tailor their experiences to their genetic propensities. It also points out that intelligence is influenced by **many genes of small effect** – early DNA studies had identified genes explaining only ~5% of IQ variance, a fraction of the roughly 50% heritable portion ([www.scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-intelligence-hereditary/#:~:text=Genes%20make%20a%20substantial%20difference%2C,resemble%20one%20another%20in%20intelligence)) ([www.scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-intelligence-hereditary/#:~:text=Another%20particularly%20interesting%20recent%20finding,fully%20develop%2C%20their%20genetic%20propensities)). *(Source: Scientific American –* [Is Intelligence Hereditary?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-intelligence-hereditary/)*)*

It reports that meta-analyses of twin studies show inherited DNA differences account for **about half of the variance** in intelligence test scores (i.e. ~50% heritability) ([docslib.org](https://docslib.org/doc/4284752/the-new-genetics-of-intelligence#:~:text=and%20adoption%20studies%20amassed%20a,neuroscience15%20were%20already%20pushing%20intelligence)). The authors discuss the highly **polygenic nature** of IQ: **thousands of DNA variants** are involved. By 2017–2018, genome-wide association studies had identified enough variants that when combined into a polygenic score, they explained **around 20% of the 50% heritable variance** in intelligence (approximately **10% of total IQ variance**) – a significant step toward accounting for the “missing heritability” ([docslib.org](https://docslib.org/doc/4284752/the-new-genetics-of-intelligence#:~:text=the%20ability%20to%20learn%2C%20reason,In%20this%20Review%2C%20we)). They emphasize that intelligence’s heritability is well-established, but these findings enable new research into how genes exert their effects (e.g. via the brain), using tools like polygenic scores. *(Source: Nature Reviews Genetics – doi:10.1038/nrg.2017.104, 2018)*

3. **Savage et al. (Nature Genetics, 2018):** *“Genome-wide association meta-analysis in 269,867 individuals identifies new genetic and functional links to intelligence.”* This large-scale genetic study identified **205 genomic loci** associated with intelligence and mapped ~1,016 genes linked to IQ differences ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6411041/#:~:text=Intelligence%20is%20highly%20heritable,regions%20and%20associations%20with%20146)). It dramatically expanded the number of known gene associations (previous studies had found only a few dozen loci). The paper confirms that intelligence is **highly heritable**, citing twin research, and using DNA data it estimated the “SNP heritability” (heritability tagged by common genetic variants) of intelligence at about **19–20%** in their sample ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6411041/#:~:text=heritability%20across%20age%2C%20as%20captured,02%29%20indicated%20that)). Notably, the associated genes were found to be strongly expressed in the **brain (especially in neurons involved in learning and memory)**, and gene pathways related to nervous system development were enriched ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6411041/#:~:text=association%20study%20of%20intelligence%20to,We%20confirm%20previous%20strong%20genetic)). This indicates that genetic influences on IQ are tied to brain biology. The study’s results reinforced that intelligence is influenced by many variants; individually these variants have tiny effects, but collectively they contribute meaningfully to IQ differences. *(Source: Nature Genetics 50:912–919, 2018 – [PMC Article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6411041/))*

4. **Briley & Tucker-Drob (Psychological Science, 2013):** *“Explaining the Increasing Heritability of Cognitive Ability Across Development: A meta-analysis of longitudinal twin and adoption studies.”* This meta-analysis examined how the heritability of cognitive ability changes from infancy through adolescence. It found that **genetic influences on intelligence *increase* with age**. For example, one set of results indicated heritability rose from about **41% at age 9 to 66% by age 17** in combined twin studies ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3954471/#:~:text=increase%20in%20heritability%20from%20approximately,at%20age%2017%20years)). Shared family environmental effects showed the opposite trend, **decreasing as children grew older** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3954471/#:~:text=Table%202,and%20larger%20decreases%20in%20shared)). The authors explored mechanisms for this pattern, suggesting that early genetic effects might **amplify over time** (as children select environments correlated with their genetic inclinations) and new genetic influences might also come into play during development. The study helps explain why young children’s IQ is less heritable (more influenced by family environment), whereas in late adolescence and beyond, genes play a larger role as individuals become free to shape their own experiences. *(Source: Psychol.

5. **Deary, Cox, & Hill (Molecular Psychiatry, 2021):** *“Genetic variation, brain, and intelligence differences.”* This is a comprehensive review of the genetic and neurobiological research on intelligence.

It discusses the gap between **twin-study heritability** and **DNA-based heritability**: methods using common SNPs often capture about **20–30% of IQ variance** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8960418/#:~:text=phenotypic%20similarity,matrix%20constructed%20from%20genotyped%20common)), but this gap has been closing as methods improve (for instance, including rare variants and family-based genetic methods can raise the DNA-based heritability closer to twin estimates ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8960418/#:~:text=for%20%5B32%5D%3B%20therefore%2C%20the%20DNA,in%20order%20to%20prevent%20an))). The review also covers how **brain structure and function correlate with IQ** – e.g., MRI studies show that larger brain volume and certain efficient neural network characteristics are associated with higher intelligence, and genetic variants linked to IQ often relate to brain development. Overall, Deary et al. emphasize a “systems biology” view: intelligence differences arise from many small genetic effects interacting with brain pathways and environment. *(Source: Mol.

6. **Sommer et al. (Intelligence, 2024):** *“DNA and IQ: Big Deal or Much Ado About Nothing? – A meta-analysis.”* This recent meta-analysis evaluated how well current polygenic scores (PGS) predict intelligence. Using data from nearly 453,000 individuals (all of European ancestry) and the latest GWAS results for IQ, it found an average **polygenic score–IQ correlation of about 0.24** ([sciety.org](https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.31234/osf.io/vwdyp#:~:text=32%20estimates%20from%209%20independent,is%20yet%20to%20be%20demonstrated)). This corresponds to the PGS explaining roughly **5–6% of the variance** in measured intelligence, which the authors describe as a **medium effect size**. The predictive power did vary between studies and samples, and while significant, it by no means captures most of the genetic influence on IQ. The authors conclude that these DNA-based predictors do **“benefit and advance research”** on intelligence (by allowing researchers to probe genetic influences), but they caution that the **practical utility is limited** – polygenic scores are not yet precise enough to make consequential predictions for individuals [6]. In short, this study underscores that known genetic variants can statistically predict a portion of IQ differences, but **much of intelligence’s heritability remains unexplained** by current polygenic scores, reinforcing that it’s a complex trait involving very many genes. *(Source: *Intelligence*, Vol. 107, 2024 – [ScienceDirect Abstract](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289624000655))*

It found that polygenic scores for intelligence and education **do predict differences among siblings** – the sibling with a higher genetic score tends to have, on average, a somewhat higher IQ/academic performance than their lower-scoring sibling. However, the prediction was **stronger between unrelated people** than within sibling pairs ([icajournal.scholasticahq.com](https://icajournal.scholasticahq.com/article/140654-polygenic-score-prediction-within-and-between-sibling-pairs-for-intelligence-cognitive-abilities-and-educational-traits-from-childhood-to-early-adul#:~:text=The%20prediction%20of%20behavioral%20traits,the%20level%20of%20the%20individual)) ([icajournal.scholasticahq.com](https://icajournal.scholasticahq.com/article/140654-polygenic-score-prediction-within-and-between-sibling-pairs-for-intelligence-cognitive-abilities-and-educational-traits-from-childhood-to-early-adul#:~:text=One%20implication%20of%20finding%20substantial,gap%E2%80%99%20between%20PGS%20or%20SNP)). The authors attribute this to **family-level genetic effects**: factors like assortative mating (smart people tending to have children with similarly smart partners), **“genetic nurture”** (parents’ genes creating an enriching environment), and other ancestry-related effects inflate genetic predictions in the general population. In a within-family comparison, those between-family effects are removed, so the **direct effect of genes** is a bit lower – yet it is still clearly present. The key implication is that standard heritability estimates might **underestimate genetic influence** on intelligence when such indirect genetic effects are accounted for ([icajournal.scholasticahq.com](https://icajournal.scholasticahq.com/article/140654-polygenic-score-prediction-within-and-between-sibling-pairs-for-intelligence-cognitive-abilities-and-educational-traits-from-childhood-to-early-adul#:~:text=the%20earliest%20DNA%20studies%20of,However%2C%20in%20twin%20studies)) ([icajournal.scholasticahq.com](https://icajournal.scholasticahq.com/article/140654-polygenic-score-prediction-within-and-between-sibling-pairs-for-intelligence-cognitive-abilities-and-educational-traits-from-childhood-to-early-adul#:~:text=2017%29,ceiling%20for%20PGS%20and%20SNP)). Conversely, part of what makes intelligence look highly heritable in the population is that genes and environment correlate (fortunate genes often come with fortunate environments). This study provides nuanced evidence that **genes matter for IQ even controlling for family environment**, but also that some genetic influence on educational outcomes is mediated through the family and society. *(Source: *Intelligence & Cognitive Abilities*, 2025, vol. 1 – via ICA Journal Scholastica)*

8. **Krapohl *et al.* (PNAS, 2014):** *“The high heritability of educational achievement reflects many genetically influenced traits, not just intelligence.”* This study used data from over 13,000 twin pairs to explore why **educational achievement (test scores at age 16)** is so heritable (around 62% in their sample). It showed that while **general intelligence is a major genetic contributor** to educational success, it’s not the only one. Other domains – such as **personality traits, motivation, self-efficacy, and behavior problems** – also have genetic influences that affect academic achievement ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1408777111#:~:text=Certificate%20of%20Secondary%20Education%20%28GCSE%29,in%20education%20toward%20personalized%20learning)) ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1408777111#:~:text=GCSE%20results%2C%20and%20these%20correlations,influenced%20traits%2C%20not%20just%20intelligence)). The researchers measured nine broad traits (beyond IQ) and found that these traits, collectively, accounted for as much of the genetic variance in GCSE exam scores as intelligence did. In numbers: intelligence was the single strongest predictor, but **together the non-IQ traits explained ~–** the same portion of heritability of school performance as IQ itself ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1408777111#:~:text=Certificate%20of%20Secondary%20Education%20%28GCSE%29,in%20education%20toward%20personalized%20learning)) ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1408777111#:~:text=GCSE%20results%2C%20and%20these%20correlations,influenced%20traits%2C%20not%20just%20intelligence)). When combined with intelligence, these predictors accounted for about **75% of the total genetic effects** on educational outcomes ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1408777111#:~:text=achievement,in%20education%20toward%20personalized%20learning)) ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1408777111#:~:text=GCSE%20results%2C%20and%20these%20correlations,influenced%20traits%2C%20not%20just%20intelligence)). The study’s message is that the **high heritability of academic achievement is “multifactorial.”** High exam scores run in families not just due to genes for high IQ, but also due to genes influencing dispositions and behaviors conducive to learning. This underscores that intelligence, while highly heritable, is part of a larger genetic mosaic influencing life outcomes. *(Source: PNAS 111(42):15273–15278, 2014 – [Full Text](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1408777111))*
