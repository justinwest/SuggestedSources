The heritability of intelligence is one of the most extensively studied topics in behavioral genetics, yet it remains complex and sometimes controversial. Research consistently shows that intelligence has a significant genetic component, though environmental factors also play a crucial role.

## Heritability Estimates

Twin, family, and adoption studies consistently indicate that intelligence, as measured by IQ tests, has a heritability of approximately 50-80% in adults [1]. The heritability appears to increase with age: around 20% in infancy, 40% in childhood, and reaching 60-80% in adulthood [2]. This phenomenon, known as the "Wilson Effect," suggests that genetic influences on intelligence become more prominent as individuals mature and have greater control over their environments [3].

## Key Research Findings

Meta-analyses of twin studies have provided robust evidence for genetic influence on intelligence. A comprehensive analysis of 2,748 publications examining virtually all twin studies on intelligence found a heritability estimate of approximately 50% across the lifespan [4]. Adoption studies further support these findings, showing that adopted children's IQ scores correlate more strongly with their biological parents than their adoptive parents [1].

Recent genomic studies have identified specific genetic variants associated with intelligence, though each individual variant typically accounts for only a tiny fraction of the variance. Polygenic scores (combining effects of many genetic variants) can now predict approximately 10-15% of the variance in intelligence, with this predictive power continuing to increase as sample sizes grow [5].

## Environmental Factors

While genetics plays a substantial role, environmental factors remain critically important. These include:

- **Socioeconomic status**: Access to education, nutrition, and cognitive stimulation significantly impacts intellectual development [2]
- **Education quality and duration**: Formal schooling has been shown to increase IQ scores [6]
- **Early childhood experiences**: Factors such as parental involvement, exposure to language, and early learning opportunities matter considerably [3]
- **Health and nutrition**: Particularly important during prenatal development and early childhood [1]

## Important Considerations

The heritability of intelligence varies across populations and socioeconomic contexts. In disadvantaged environments, environmental factors may play a larger role, while genetic factors become more prominent in advantaged environments where basic needs are met [7]. This is known as the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis.

It's crucial to understand that heritability is a population statistic that describes variation within a group, not the fixed genetic determination of any individual's intelligence [8]. High heritability does not mean intelligence is unchangeable—environmental interventions can still have significant effects.

## Current Scientific Consensus

The scientific consensus acknowledges both genetic and environmental contributions to intelligence. Most researchers agree that:
- Intelligence has a substantial genetic component (50-80% heritability in adults)
- Environmental factors remain important throughout life
- Gene-environment interactions are complex and bidirectional
- Intelligence is polygenic, influenced by thousands of genetic variants
- Heritability estimates apply to populations, not individuals [9]
