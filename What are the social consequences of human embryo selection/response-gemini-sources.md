Human embryo selection, a process that uses in vitro fertilization (IVF) and genetic testing to choose embryos for implantation based on their traits, has a range of profound potential social consequences. These consequences span from creating new forms of social inequality to fundamentally altering family structures and societal values.

The primary social consequences include:

**1. Increased Social Stratification and a New "Biological" Class Divide**
A major concern is that embryo selection will exacerbate existing inequalities and create a new, biologically-based class system. The high cost of IVF and polygenic risk scoring (PRS) for embryo selection means the technology will initially be accessible only to the wealthy [1, 2].

*   This could lead to the emergence of a "managerial elite" or a "genobility" that can afford to select for desirable traits like higher intelligence or lower disease risk in their children, while the rest of society cannot [1, 3].
*   Over generations, this could create a feedback loop where economic advantage translates into genetic advantage, further entrenching a class divide that is not just social but biological [1].
*   While some argue that, like other medical technologies, the cost will eventually fall and become more accessible, the initial period of unequal access could create significant and lasting social stratification [2]. This advantage could undermine the ideal of social mobility and the principle that all individuals, regardless of their background, have a chance to succeed [3].

**2. Shifting Social Norms and Pressure to Conform**
Widespread adoption of embryo selection could shift social norms and create immense pressure on prospective parents.

*   If the technology becomes commonplace for selecting against disease or for traits like intelligence, parents who choose not to use it may be seen as irresponsible or as willingly putting their children at a disadvantage [2].
*   This could create a competitive "arms race" where parents feel obligated to use the technology to ensure their children can compete in society, turning procreation into a project of optimization rather than an act of unconditional acceptance [2, 3].
*   Furthermore, the ability to screen out predispositions for conditions like schizophrenia or autism could change societal views on disability. While intended to reduce suffering, it may also foster intolerance for human imperfection and decrease social acceptance and support for individuals living with disabilities [4].

**3. Transformation of Family, Parenting, and Reproduction**
Embryo selection and related technologies contribute to the decoupling of reproduction from traditional family structures and biological inheritance.

*   The process medicalizes and rationalizes procreation, turning it from a natural event into a managed, technological project. This alters the parent-child relationship, potentially creating new expectations for a child to live up to their "genetic potential" [1, 3].
*   Alex Kaschuta argues this trend will accelerate a shift towards a "post-familial" society, where the traditional family unit's role in passing down biological and social inheritance is diminished, replaced by market-based technological solutions [1].
*   This changes the very meaning of kinship, as the biological link between parents and children becomes just one of many variables to be managed and optimized [1].

**4. The Resurfacing of Eugenics in a New Form**
The practice of selecting embryos based on desirable traits raises the specter of eugenics.

*   Proponents differentiate modern embryo selection from the coercive, state-sponsored eugenics of the 20th century. They frame it as a matter of individual liberty and parental choice, or "personal eugenics," aimed at giving a child the best possible start in life [2]. Scott Alexander notes that its current application is focused more on reducing disease risk than on enhancement [2].
*   However, critics argue that even if based on individual choices, the aggregate result could be a form of "liberal eugenics," where social pressures and market forces drive society toward a narrower and genetically stratified vision of humanity [3]. This could lead to a loss of genetic diversity and a society that is less accepting of human difference.

She predicts it will lead to a new, biologically-based class stratification, creating a "managerial elite" that can afford genetic optimization while the masses cannot, resulting in a "post-familial" society.

2.  **Scott Alexander, "Suddenly, Trait-Based Embryo Selection," *Astral Codex Ten*.** Alexander provides a more analytical and cautious perspective. He examines the practical capabilities and limitations of current technology, framing the debate as one of parental choice versus concerns about inequality and social pressure. He distinguishes modern, choice-based selection from historical eugenics and suggests that while inequality is a real concern, costs may eventually fall, making the technology more accessible.

Sandel, a philosopher, argues against genetic enhancement from a position of social and moral concern. He contends that it would entrench inequality, destroy social solidarity, and promote a harmful drive for mastery over the "giftedness" of life, ultimately eroding our appreciation for unconditional human flourishing.

She posits that disability is a source of human diversity and innovation and that a society that seeks to eradicate it will become less resilient, less just, and less interesting. Her view highlights the negative social consequences for people with disabilities in a world that increasingly values genetic "perfection."
