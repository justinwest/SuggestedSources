Human embryo selection, particularly through technologies like preimplantation genetic testing for polygenic traits (PGT-P), involves screening embryos created via in vitro fertilization (IVF) to select for or against complex traits influenced by many genes, such as height, intelligence, or risk for certain diseases [1, 4]. This capability introduces a range of profound social consequences.

### 1. Exacerbation of Social and Economic Inequality
A primary concern is that embryo selection could create a new, biologically reinforced class system. The technology is expensive and likely to be accessible only to the wealthy, allowing them to select for embryos with genetic predispositions for traits like higher intelligence or better health. This could lead to a "genetic divide" between the affluent and the rest of society [1].

The Palladium Magazine article warns of the rise of a new hereditary aristocracy, a "genobility," whose advantages are not just social and economic but also biological. This would entrench inequality across generations, making social mobility significantly more difficult. Over time, this could create a society stratified into a "genetically-enhanced" upper class and a "natural" lower class, fundamentally altering concepts of merit and fairness [1].

### 2. Geopolitical Competition and a Genetic "Arms Race"
The social consequences extend to the international level. Nations might view genetic enhancement as a strategic asset for gaining a competitive edge. A state that encourages or subsidizes embryo selection to raise its population's average cognitive ability or health could gain significant economic and military advantages [1]. This could trigger a genetic "arms race," where other nations feel compelled to adopt similar programs to avoid falling behind. The Palladium article suggests that countries with different ethical frameworks, such as China, might pursue this technology aggressively, forcing more liberal societies to confront the choice between their ethical reservations and national competitiveness [1].

### 3. Impact on People with Disabilities and Human Diversity
Embryo selection raises serious concerns for people with disabilities and the value of human diversity. The ability to screen out embryos with genetic markers for conditions like deafness, dwarfism, or predispositions to psychiatric disorders is often framed as a medical benefit. However, disability rights advocates argue this practice is discriminatory [2].

This perspective, known as the "expressivist argument," posits that the choice to prevent the birth of a person with a certain trait expresses a negative judgment about the worth of living with that trait. This can devalue the lives of existing people with disabilities, potentially leading to reduced social support, increased stigma, and a perception that their existence is a preventable burden [2, 3]. Furthermore, a societal push toward genetic "optimization" could narrow the spectrum of human variation, which many see as a valuable end in itself [3].

### 4. Changes to Parenthood and the Family
The availability of embryo selection technology alters the nature of procreation and parenting. It can transform reproduction into a consumerist activity, where parents feel pressured to "build the best baby" by choosing from a menu of genetic options. This introduces a new set of anxieties and responsibilities for prospective parents, who may be judged for not using technology to give their child every possible advantage [1, 3].

This shift also raises questions about the psychological impact on children who know they were selected based on specific genetic scores. It could create a burden of expectation to live up to their "genetic potential" and could change the nature of parental love from unconditional acceptance to a more conditional form based on desired outcomes [3]. This "commodification" of children risks undermining the parent-child relationship and the intrinsic value of a person regardless of their genetic makeup [3].

### 5. Scientific Limitations and Misleading Promises
While the social debates are active, it is crucial to note the current scientific limitations of PGT-P. Polygenic risk scores (PRS), the basis for this technology, can currently explain only a small percentage of the variation in complex traits like intelligence. The predicted "gain" from selecting the "best" embryo out of a typical batch is often minimal and statistically uncertain [4].

Furthermore, these scores are largely based on data from people of European ancestry and are significantly less accurate when applied to other populations. This creates a risk of exacerbating racial health disparities and providing misleading information to prospective parents [4]. As the science stands, the dramatic scenarios of creating "designer babies" with substantially enhanced intelligence are not yet feasible. However, the technology is being marketed, and the social and ethical frameworks are being established now, making the debate urgent even before the science reaches the level envisioned by some of its proponents and critics [1, 4].

    *   **Author's View:** The anonymous authors argue that avoiding the topic of biological inheritance is dangerous. They contend that embryo selection technology is inevitable and will lead to profound social stratification, creating a permanent, genetically-advantaged upper class ("genobility"). They also predict a geopolitical "arms race" as nations compete by enhancing their populations' genetic capital. The central thesis is that society must confront these consequences openly rather than upholding a taboo against discussing them.

She argues that this practice devalues disabled individuals and can lead to social harm and discrimination, regardless of the parents' intentions.

The Council highlights concerns about social justice, the potential to reinforce discrimination and division in society, and the impact on the welfare of the future person. It discusses how these technologies could change norms around parenthood and the risk of commodifying human life.

    *   **Author's View:** This scientific paper, authored by a large group of geneticists and social scientists, critiques the current use of polygenic scores for embryo selection (PGT-P). The authors demonstrate that the predictive power of these scores is currently very low, and the expected "gain" from selection is minimal for most traits. They also highlight major problems with statistical uncertainty and the lack of transferability of scores across different ancestral populations, concluding that the technology is not scientifically supported for its advertised uses.
