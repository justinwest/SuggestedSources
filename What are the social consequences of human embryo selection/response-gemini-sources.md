Human embryo selection, particularly through technologies like preimplantation genetic testing for polygenic disorders (PGT-P), presents a range of significant social consequences that are debated by ethicists, scientists, and social commentators. The primary concerns revolve around social inequality, the concept of eugenics, and fundamental shifts in how society views risk, parenthood, and human value [1, 2, 3].

### Exacerbation of Social Inequality
A major social consequence of embryo selection is the potential to create new and entrenched forms of class division. Because the technology relies on in vitro fertilization (IVF), it is expensive and likely to be accessible only to the wealthy [2]. This could lead to a future where the affluent can select for advantageous traits—such as higher intelligence or lower risk for certain diseases—while the less affluent cannot [1, 2].

*   **Creation of a "Bio-Aristocracy"**: Samo Burja, writing in *Palladium*, argues that this technology could enable the formation of a "genetically-advantaged class." Over generations, the compounding of biological advantages with existing social and economic ones could create a new, biologically distinct aristocracy, making social mobility more difficult and hardening class structures [1].
*   **A Widening Gap**: Scott Alexander, in *Astral Codex Ten*, notes that even if the immediate gains from selection are small (e.g., a few IQ points), they are not zero. When only the rich can afford this advantage for their children, it systematically widens the gap between the socioeconomic classes. This creates a feedback loop where wealth buys genetic advantages, which in turn leads to greater success and wealth [2].

### The Specter of Eugenics and Shifting Social Values
The term "eugenics" is frequently invoked in discussions about embryo selection, raising fears of a return to state-sponsored programs aimed at perfecting the human gene pool. While modern proponents draw a sharp distinction between coercive state policies and individual parental choice, the social implications remain a point of concern [2].

*   **Individual Choice vs. Societal Outcome**: Alexander points out that while embryo selection is framed as a private, parental decision, the cumulative effect of millions of such decisions could reshape society in ways that resemble the goals of old eugenics movements [2].
*   **State Interest**: Burja warns that the state may eventually take an interest in this technology. A state might see a healthier, more intelligent populace as a national asset, potentially leading to incentives or pressures for citizens to use embryo selection, blurring the line between choice and coercion [1].
*   **Changing Perceptions of Disability**: The ability to screen out embryos with a high genetic risk for conditions like schizophrenia or even a predisposition to lower intelligence could change social attitudes. Conditions that were once seen as a matter of misfortune or fate could be viewed as preventable, potentially leading to less social tolerance and support for those living with disabilities or perceived imperfections [2].

### Re-evaluating Risk and the "Genetic Lottery"
A key social consequence is a fundamental shift in how we perceive risk, choice, and nature. Dwarkesh Patel argues in *The Infinitesimal* that public discourse is often skewed by a powerful status quo bias. We tend to view the "natural genetic lottery," with all its random diseases and disabilities, as an acceptable baseline, while viewing active intervention (embryo selection) as uniquely risky and morally fraught [3].

*   **Omission vs. Commission Bias**: Patel argues that society is more uncomfortable with harms caused by *action* (commission) than with harms caused by *inaction* (omission). Therefore, choosing an embryo that later develops a problem feels worse than having a child with a problem that could have been prevented through screening. He contends that choosing *not* to screen is also an active choice with moral weight, one that accepts the preventable suffering caused by the "natural lottery" [3].
*   **The Slippery Slope**: A common fear is that selecting against severe diseases will inevitably lead to selecting for cosmetic traits like height or hair color, and then to more complex traits like intelligence. Alexander acknowledges this "slippery slope" as a real concern for a society trying to decide where to draw the line. What begins as a tool for preventing tragedy could become a tool for human enhancement, with all the attendant social consequences of inequality and social pressure [2].

In summary, the social consequences of embryo selection are profound. They risk creating a genetically stratified society, raise difficult questions about eugenics and human value, and force a re-evaluation of how we think about risk, choice, and the ethics of parenthood [1, 2, 3].

    *   Author Dwarkesh Patel critiques the typical framework for discussing the ethics of embryo selection. He argues that society suffers from cognitive biases, such as "omission bias" and "status quo bias," which cause us to overstate the risks of technological intervention while downplaying the significant, known harms of the "natural genetic lottery." He reframes the decision not to screen as a morally significant choice in itself.
