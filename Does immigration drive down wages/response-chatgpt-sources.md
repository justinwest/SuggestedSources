Immigration does **not appear to broadly depress wages** for native-born workers as a whole. A large body of economic research finds that the overall impact of immigration on average wages is **small to negligible** ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=provide%20little%20supporting%20evidence%20to,been%20insulated%20by%20differences%20in)) ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=Several%20studies%20have%20examined%20whether,either%20small%20or%20no%20effects)). In fact, some studies even suggest **slight positive effects** on native wages, since immigrants not only add to labor supply but also **increase demand** for goods and services (creating new jobs and business opportunities) ([www.epi.org](https://www.epi.org/publication/bp255/#:~:text=In%20the%20ongoing%20debate%20on,services%2C%20which%20creates%20more%20jobs)). In other words, as the workforce expands through immigration, the economy tends to adjust in ways that **offset simple wage competition** – for example, by stimulating investment or prompting natives to specialize in complementary tasks ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=More%20likely%2C%20as%20evidenced%20by,production%20tasks%2C%20which%20complement%20the)). 

However, **immigration’s effects can differ across worker groups**. Research shows that any wage declines from immigration are usually concentrated among workers who **directly compete** with new immigrants.  For instance, detailed analyses by the U.S. National Academies and others have found that **previous immigrants** (who have skill profiles similar to new arrivals) and some **lower-educated native-born workers** may experience *modest* wage reductions due to immigration ([nap.nationalacademies.org](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/23550/chapter/2#:~:text=of%20more%20than%2010%20years%2C,shortly%2C%20suggest%20the%20possibility%20of)). These effects are generally small – often on the order of a few percentage points – and are **not observed for most other workers**. A U.K. government review similarly concluded that immigration had **“little or no” overall impact on wages**, with **minor negative effects** mainly for lower-education workers and **positive wage effects** for higher-skilled groups ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=2018%20and%20drew%20three%20conclusions,a%20negative)). At the same time, immigration can **boost wages for certain natives** by filling labor shortages and enhancing productivity. High-skilled native workers, for example, may earn more when lower-skilled immigrants expand the workforce in ways that increase the natives’ productivity (such as enabling specialization or business growth) ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=2018%20and%20drew%20three%20conclusions,a%20negative)) ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=Most%20studies%20that%20explicitly%20consider,offset%20competition%20effects%2C%20producing%20the)). 

It’s worth noting that **not all economists agree** on the exact size of immigration’s impact. Some researchers have reported larger wage downturns for specific groups, especially in earlier decades. Notably, economist **George Borjas** estimated that the influx of immigrant labor from 1980–2000 significantly **reduced wages for U.S. high-school dropouts** (a group of workers in direct competition with many immigrants) by roughly **5–7%** ([prospect.org](https://prospect.org/economy/immigrants-make-everyone-except-high-school-dropouts-better-off/#:~:text=in%20wages,is%20a%20bit%20of%20slight)). This finding implies a measurable downside for the least-educated natives, and it is frequently cited by those arguing that immigration *can* drive down wages. **Other experts, however, dispute these sizable effects** and point out limitations in those studies’ methods. When economists look at real-world “natural experiments” of sudden immigration surges, they often find **minimal wage impact**. A famous example is David Card’s study of the **Mariel Boatlift** (Miami, 1980), where a sudden 7% increase in Miami’s labor force had **no significant effect** on native Miamians’ wages or unemployment rates – even among low-skilled workers ([flaglerlive.com](https://flaglerlive.com/david-card-immigration-wages/#:~:text=Card%20found%20a%20%E2%80%9Cnull%E2%80%9D%20effect,at%20odds%20with%20a%20lot)). Findings like Card’s bolster the view that **immigration generally does not depress wages** for the average native worker, because labor markets adjust via new jobs, relocation, and other economic responses ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=depress%20wages%20by%20competing%20with,Such%20studies%20show%20that)) ([www.cato.org](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2017/does-immigration-reduce-wages#:~:text=lead%20to%20smaller%2C%20negative%20elasticity,Dustmann)). 

**In summary, most economic evidence indicates that immigration has **not caused a broad decline in wages** for native-born workers. Overall wage effects tend to be very small, near zero on average, once the economy adjusts ([nap.nationalacademies.org](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/23550/chapter/2#:~:text=of%20more%20than%2010%20years%2C,shortly%2C%20suggest%20the%20possibility%20of)) ([www.epi.org](https://www.epi.org/publication/bp255/#:~:text=In%20the%20ongoing%20debate%20on,services%2C%20which%20creates%20more%20jobs)). **Modest negative impacts** can occur for *some* workers – particularly prior immigrants or those with the least education – who directly compete with new immigrant labor ([nap.nationalacademies.org](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/23550/chapter/2#:~:text=range%2C%20indicating%20a%20revised%20and,well%20as%20at%20the%20aggregate)). Even in these cases, the wage reductions are generally limited (a few percent) rather than dramatic. Other workers often see **neutral or positive effects**, as immigrants contribute complementary skills and boost aggregate demand ([www.epi.org](https://www.epi.org/publication/bp255/#:~:text=In%20the%20ongoing%20debate%20on,services%2C%20which%20creates%20more%20jobs)) ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=2018%20and%20drew%20three%20conclusions,a%20negative)). The consensus among experts is that while immigration *may* exert slight downward pressure in specific low-skill labor markets, it does **not overall “drive down” wages**, and it can bring longer-term economic benefits that **raise productivity and wages** economy-wide ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=provide%20little%20supporting%20evidence%20to,been%20insulated%20by%20differences%20in)) ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=Most%20studies%20that%20explicitly%20consider,offset%20competition%20effects%2C%20producing%20the)).

Economist Giovanni Peri surveys international evidence and finds that **immigration has essentially no negative impact on average native wages**. Short-run wage effects are **near zero**, and in the long run immigrants often **boost productivity**, which can **increase overall wages** rather than reduce them ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=provide%20little%20supporting%20evidence%20to,been%20insulated%20by%20differences%20in)) ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=Most%20studies%20that%20explicitly%20consider,offset%20competition%20effects%2C%20producing%20the)).

2. **Heidi Shierholz (Economic Policy Institute)** – *“Immigration and Wages: Methodological advancements confirm modest gains for native workers”* (2010). Shierholz reviews academic studies and reports a **broad consensus** that immigration has a **small but positive effect** on average wages of native-born workers ([www.epi.org](https://www.epi.org/publication/bp255/#:~:text=In%20the%20ongoing%20debate%20on,services%2C%20which%20creates%20more%20jobs)). New immigrant workers do add labor supply, but they also **increase consumer demand and spur job creation**, offsetting downward pressure on wages. (In other words, **immigrants generally *do not* drive down overall wages**, and may slightly increase them.)

3. **National Academies of Sciences (2016 report)** – *“The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration.”* This comprehensive expert panel found that over a 10-year period, the **impact of immigration on overall native wages is very small**. Any **negative wage effects** are **mainly concentrated among specific subgroups**, notably **prior immigrants and native-born workers with very low education (high-school dropouts)** ([nap.nationalacademies.org](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/23550/chapter/2#:~:text=of%20more%20than%2010%20years%2C,shortly%2C%20suggest%20the%20possibility%20of)). For most other native workers, wages are unaffected or even **slightly improved** by immigration. (The report concludes that immigration **does not broadly lower wages** of natives, and can have **positive productivity and wage effects** in the long run.)

4. **Migration Observatory (Oxford University)** – *“The Labour Market Effects of Immigration”* (2023 briefing). This UK-focused review of research finds **“most studies…have found either small or no effects”** of immigration on native workers’ wages or employment ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=Several%20studies%20have%20examined%20whether,either%20small%20or%20no%20effects)). The government’s Migration Advisory Committee concluded that any wage impacts were **mixed by skill level** – with **modest negative effects on lower-educated workers and positive effects on higher-educated workers**, and little to no overall impact ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=2018%20and%20drew%20three%20conclusions,a%20negative)). (In sum, immigration’s effect on wages in the UK has been **negligible on average**, with **slight losses at the low end of the wage scale and gains at the high end**.)

5. **George Borjas (various studies, 2003–2007)** – Borjas, a Harvard economist, has argued that **low-skilled immigration can put downward pressure on low-skilled natives’ wages**. His influential studies using 1980–2000 data suggested that large inflows of less-educated immigrants **reduced wages for U.S. high school dropouts by around 5–7%** ([prospect.org](https://prospect.org/economy/immigrants-make-everyone-except-high-school-dropouts-better-off/#:~:text=in%20wages,is%20a%20bit%20of%20slight)). (Borjas’s findings support the view that immigration *can* drive down wages for certain vulnerable groups, although his conclusions are **contested by other researchers** who obtain smaller effects.)

6. **David Card (1990)** – In his landmark study of the **Mariel Boatlift** (when ~125,000 Cuban refugees entered Miami in 1980), Card found **no evidence** that the sudden immigration surge **reduced wages or raised unemployment** for native Miami workers ([flaglerlive.com](https://flaglerlive.com/david-card-immigration-wages/#:~:text=Card%20found%20a%20%E2%80%9Cnull%E2%80%9D%20effect,at%20odds%20with%20a%20lot)). Even among **less-skilled natives**, wages were **unaffected** by the 7% labor force increase. (Card’s natural experiment is a key piece of evidence that **immigration does not necessarily drive down native wages**, challenging the notion that more workers automatically mean lower wages.)
