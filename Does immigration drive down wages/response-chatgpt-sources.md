Immigration’s impact on wages is a much-studied and debated topic among economists. **Basic economic theory** suggests that an increase in the supply of workers (through immigration) could put downward pressure on wages for similar workers. In a simple supply-and-demand framework, if more workers compete for the same jobs, employers may not need to offer as high a wage to attract labor. Some research indeed finds that immigration can *reduce wages for certain groups in the short run*. For example, economist George Borjas estimates that the large influx of immigrants in recent decades has modestly lowered the average wage of native-born workers in the U.S. (one analysis pegged the impact at roughly a 5% reduction in overall wages) ([migration.ucdavis.edu](https://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/more.php?id=2010#:~:text=A%20September%202016%20report%2C%20,the%20subsequent%20fall%20in%20wages)). Borjas argues that when immigrants with similar skills enter the labor force, **wages for comparable native workers are likely to drop**, while business owners benefit from lower labor costs. In his words, a bigger labor supply “will likely reduce the wage that employers need to offer” to hire workers, even as it **raises profits for employers**, meaning immigration creates winners and losers ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/839171608/George-J-Borjas-We-Wanted-Workers-1#:~:text=well,Americans%20will%20be%20worse%20off)). This view aligns with the concern that less-educated or prior immigrant workers may face lower wages due to competition from new immigrants.

However, **empirical evidence finds that the overall effect of immigration on wages is small**, and often close to neutral, especially in the long term. Many studies fail to detect significant widespread wage declines from immigration. Immigrants do not simply substitute for native workers one-to-one; they also *complement* many native-born workers and contribute to economic growth and new demand. For instance, immigrants often take jobs that natives are less willing to do or that help businesses expand, which can create *additional jobs or higher productivity* for the economy. High-skilled immigrants, in particular, tend to boost innovation and productivity, which **can *raise* wages for many native workers** (by increasing overall economic output and creating new opportunities) ([migration.ucdavis.edu](https://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/more.php?id=2010#:~:text=The%20NAS%20report%20found%20that,mixed)). Even among lower-skilled jobs, immigrants often fill crucial roles (in agriculture, care work, etc.) that help other sectors function, potentially keeping some industries viable and consumer prices lower. The spending of immigrant workers also generates new demand for goods and services, which supports other jobs. These dynamics help explain why native-born workers’ wages generally have not been dramatically harmed by immigration – the economy adjusts. Over time, capital investment, business expansion, and new specializations tend to absorb the larger workforce.

Comprehensive reviews by expert panels have concluded that **immigration has little to no negative impact on average wages in the long run** ([migration.ucdavis.edu](https://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/more.php?id=2010#:~:text=The%20NAS%20report%20concluded%20that,with%20little%20education%2C%20including%20teenagers)). A major report from the National Academies of Sciences (2016) found that immigration’s overall effect on the wages of native-born Americans was very small. Initially, an influx of immigrants may slightly depress wages for some workers who compete directly, **especially earlier immigrants or native workers without a high school diploma** ([migration.ucdavis.edu](https://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/more.php?id=2010#:~:text=the%20long%20term%2C%20in%20part,with%20little%20education%2C%20including%20teenagers)). For example, teens or workers with very low education might see some wage declines when immigrant labor increases in certain low-skill sectors, and previous immigrants can experience wage competition from newer immigrants. But for the majority of native-born workers, the wage effects tend to be **minimal to negligible over time**. The economy typically adjusts via new job creation and investment. In the long run, most studies find **no large wage depression from immigration for native workers** as a whole ([migration.ucdavis.edu](https://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/more.php?id=2010#:~:text=The%20NAS%20report%20concluded%20that,with%20little%20education%2C%20including%20teenagers)). It’s worth noting that the same NAS report quantified a modest “immigration surplus” – a net economic benefit to the native-born population (approximately 0.3% of GDP) resulting from immigration – largely because employers and consumers gain from lower labor costs even as some workers lose wages ([migration.ucdavis.edu](https://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/more.php?id=2010#:~:text=A%20September%202016%20report%2C%20,the%20subsequent%20fall%20in%20wages)). In other words, immigration *redistributes* income: some native workers may earn less, but owners of capital and businesses earn more, and consumers may pay lower prices. The *net* effect on total native income is slightly positive, and the negative impact is concentrated on certain groups rather than spread across all workers.

Indeed, **the wage impact of immigration is not uniform** – it depends on the skill levels of immigrants and native workers, as well as economic conditions. Research indicates that **new immigrants often hurt “substitute” workers but help “complementary” workers**. For example, an influx of low-skilled immigrants may slightly reduce wages for low-skilled native-born workers in the same field (substitutes) while raising wages for higher-skilled natives (complements) by making businesses more productive overall. Similarly, high-skilled immigrants (like engineers or doctors) might compete with some native professionals, but they can also spur innovation, create companies, or expand services, *increasing demand* for other jobs. Many economists, such as David Card and others, have studied real-world events (like the Mariel boatlift in 1980, when a sudden wave of Cuban immigrants entered Miami) and found **little to no significant drop in wages or employment for locals** in those cases – suggesting labor markets absorbed immigrants without harming native workers’ earnings [^]. While some conflicting studies (including a re-analysis by Borjas) argue there were localized wage declines for certain groups, the broader consensus is that large immigration episodes did not widely depress wages for long.

**Other factors** are often more important than immigration in determining wage trends. Changes in technology, automation, globalization of trade, the decline of unions, and minimum wage policies have had substantial effects on middle and low-wage workers’ earnings. For instance, manufacturing jobs moving overseas or technological changes eliminating certain jobs can hurt wages and are not caused by immigration. It can be misleading to attribute decades of wage stagnation for U.S. blue-collar workers *entirely* to immigration. In fact, some analyses argue that U.S. economic policy “sold out” its workers through a combination of outsourcing, weaker labor protections, and *also* a reliance on cheaper immigrant labor – a mix of factors reducing bargaining power and wage growth for lower-skilled Americans ([migration.ucdavis.edu](https://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/more.php?id=2010#:~:text=A%20September%202016%20report%2C%20,the%20subsequent%20fall%20in%20wages)) ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/839171608/George-J-Borjas-We-Wanted-Workers-1#:~:text=well,Americans%20will%20be%20worse%20off)). In this view, immigration played a role in holding down wages in certain industries (by expanding the labor pool willing to work for lower pay), but it is part of a larger picture alongside corporate offshoring and automation [3]. It’s notable that during periods when immigration slowed (for example, during the COVID-19 pandemic or restrictive policy periods), wage growth for lower-wage jobs did tick up – suggesting that a tighter labor supply can benefit workers. However, those wage gains may also reflect other factors like economic stimulus and labor market recovery, not just immigration changes. Overall, isolating the effect of immigration on wages is complex, but most rigorous studies find **only a modest impact**.

**In summary:** immigration does *not* appear to be the primary driver of wage levels for most workers, though it can exert *some* downward pressure on wages for specific groups (especially workers similar to immigrants in skills). The **consensus view in economics** is that **immigration’s overall impact on native wages is small** [1]. Immigrants increase the size of the economy and often fill niches that make the economy more efficient. While there are **some winners and losers** – with businesses and consumers generally benefiting and certain workers facing more competition – the effect on wages is nowhere near the dramatic “harm” that some fear. Policies like education, training, and labor protections can help ensure that native workers aren’t undercut, but broadly speaking, historical data show **immigration has not substantially driven down U.S. wages** on average [2][1]. It acts more as a redistributive force: *some* workers (especially prior immigrants or those without a diploma) might lose a bit in wages due to immigrant competition, while other Americans gain via lower prices or higher business profits ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/839171608/George-J-Borjas-We-Wanted-Workers-1#:~:text=well,Americans%20will%20be%20worse%20off)) ([migration.ucdavis.edu](https://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/more.php?id=2010#:~:text=A%20September%202016%20report%2C%20,the%20subsequent%20fall%20in%20wages)). Thus, the evidence suggests that immigration only **slightly affects wages**, and mostly at the margins, rather than dramatically lowering pay across the board. Long-term, a dynamic economy tends to absorb immigrant labor with minimal impact on most natives’ paychecks, though continued attention is warranted for the vulnerable workers who do face wage competition.
