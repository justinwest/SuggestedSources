The relationship between immigration and wages is complex and nuanced, with economic research showing mixed effects that depend heavily on context, time frame, and the specific groups being examined.

## Short-term vs. Long-term Effects

In the short term, immigration can create downward pressure on wages, particularly for workers with similar skill levels to new immigrants [1]. However, this effect tends to diminish over time as the economy adjusts. In the long term, immigration often leads to wage increases for native workers as immigrants complement rather than directly compete with existing workers [2].

## Skill-Level Considerations

The impact varies significantly by skill level:

**Low-skilled workers**: Some studies find modest negative effects on wages for native workers without high school diplomas, with estimates ranging from 0-5% wage decreases [3]. However, these effects are often temporary and may be offset by other factors.

**High-skilled workers**: Immigration of skilled workers generally has positive or neutral effects on native wages, as these workers often create new businesses, drive innovation, and generate demand for complementary services [4].

## Geographic and Temporal Factors

The wage effects of immigration are not uniform across locations or time periods. Areas with more flexible labor markets and higher economic growth tend to absorb immigrants more easily without significant wage depression [5]. Additionally, the composition of immigrant flows matters - refugees and asylum seekers may have different labor market impacts than economic migrants [6].

## Complementary vs. Substitutable Workers

A key factor is whether immigrants perform jobs that complement or substitute for native workers. When immigrants take jobs that native workers are less likely to pursue, or when they have different skill sets, the effect on wages can be positive [7]. Many immigrants start businesses at higher rates than native-born citizens, creating employment opportunities that can boost wages [8].

## Economic Growth Effects

Immigration contributes to overall economic growth by expanding the labor force, increasing consumer demand, and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurship [9]. These macroeconomic effects can lead to wage increases that offset any short-term competitive pressures.

## Empirical Evidence

Large-scale studies examining historical immigration patterns generally find small to negligible effects on native wages. The National Academy of Sciences concluded that immigration has had relatively small effects on wages and employment of native-born workers, with any negative effects concentrated among prior immigrants and native-born workers without high school diplomas [10].

## Policy Context

The wage effects of immigration are also influenced by labor market policies, minimum wage laws, and the legal status of immigrants. Undocumented workers may depress wages more than legal immigrants due to their vulnerability to exploitation [11].

In conclusion, while immigration can create short-term wage pressures in specific sectors and skill levels, the overall long-term effect on wages is generally neutral to positive, with benefits distributed unevenly across the economy.
