Immigration’s impact on wages has been studied extensively, and most economic research finds that immigration does **not** significantly drive down overall wages for native-born workers[^1][^2]. In other words, the average effect of immigration on wages tends to be **small to negligible**. Over the past few decades, many studies in various countries (including the US and UK) have found **little to no decrease in average wages** as a result of increased immigration ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=Politicians%2C%20the%20media%2C%20and%20the,native%20workers%20as%20immigration%20rises)) ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=,who%20are%20migrants%20themselves%20More%E2%80%A6)). This is partly because the economy adjusts in response to new workers: immigrants participate as consumers and entrepreneurs, which **expands demand for goods and services** and can create new jobs. Employers respond to a larger labor supply by investing in new capital, adopting new technologies, or shifting native workers into roles that complement immigrant labor (such as jobs requiring language proficiency or customer interaction) ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=The%20recent%20empirical%20literature%20emphasizes,wages%20of%20native%20workers%2C%20even)) ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=economies%20respond%20to%20immigrant%20inflows,much%20in%20response%20to%20immigration)). These adjustments mean that a greater supply of workers doesn’t necessarily translate into lower pay – instead, the market often **absorbs immigrant labor without cutting overall wages** ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=The%20recent%20empirical%20literature%20emphasizes,wages%20of%20native%20workers%2C%20even)) ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=economies%20respond%20to%20immigrant%20inflows,much%20in%20response%20to%20immigration)). Indeed, comprehensive analyses have concluded that immigration has **“little to no” negative effect on the wages** or employment levels of native-born populations as a whole ([www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/news/nas-report-finds-immigration-win-us-economy#:~:text=U.S.,did%20not%20graduate%20high%20school)). Some economists even find a slight *positive* impact on average wages in the long run, since immigrants can boost productivity and innovation – especially when they bring skills that complement the native workforce ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=Author%27s%20main%20message)). In summary, **immigration is not a major factor driving broad wage declines** in the economy[^2][^3].

However, immigration’s effect on wages **is not uniform across all workers**, and modest impacts can occur for specific groups. Research often finds that **lower‐skill or lower-wage workers** experience the most competition from incoming immigrants, while higher-skill workers may actually benefit. For example, studies in the UK and US have detected *slight* wage decreases at the bottom of the wage distribution alongside *slight* wage increases at the top, though these effects are **very small** in magnitude ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=Low,but%20the%20effects%20are%20small)) ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%202022%20study,findings%20%2015%20from%20other)). One UK government review concluded that if any wage impacts exist, they are concentrated among certain groups – **a minor negative effect for native workers with lower education, and a small positive effect for higher-educated workers** – with **little or no impact on the average wage overall** ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20the%20Migration%20Advisory,or%20unemployment%2C%20specifically%20during%20downturns)) ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=Similarly%2C%20the%20MAC%20review%20concluded,others%20found%20positive%20average%20effects)). Crucially, even where wage depression is observed for lower-paid natives, studies indicate the effect is **modest**. For instance, one detailed analysis found that a 1 percentage-point increase in the share of immigrants in low-wage service jobs **reduced wages in those jobs by only about 0.2%** (i.e. a **0.2% dip**)[^4] ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%202022%20study,findings%20%2015%20from%20other)) – a barely perceptible change. Moreover, **immigrants tend to compete most directly with other immigrants** (or with very similar skill workers), rather than with native-born workers who often have different skills or occupations ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=workers%20who%20are%20migrants%20themselves)) ([www.epi.org](https://www.epi.org/publication/bp255/#:~:text=A%20key%20result%20from%20this,new%20immigrants%E2%80%94that%20is%2C%20earlier%20immigrants)). Empirical data support this substitution pattern: one U.S. study found that from 1994–2007, the influx of new immigrants **slightly *raised*** wages for U.S.-born workers (by about +0.4%), while **lowering wages for earlier immigrants by roughly 4–5%** ([www.epi.org](https://www.epi.org/publication/bp255/#:~:text=A%20key%20result%20from%20this,new%20immigrants%E2%80%94that%20is%2C%20earlier%20immigrants)). In other words, any wage pressures from new immigration were absorbed largely by **immigrant workers already in the country**, not by native workers ([www.epi.org](https://www.epi.org/publication/bp255/#:~:text=A%20key%20result%20from%20this,new%20immigrants%E2%80%94that%20is%2C%20earlier%20immigrants)). Similarly, the U.S. National Academies panel noted that recent immigrants may modestly depress wages of **prior** immigrants or very low-educated natives (such as high school dropouts), but that **other native workers are mostly unaffected** ([www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/news/nas-report-finds-immigration-win-us-economy#:~:text=U.S.,did%20not%20graduate%20high%20school)). Overall, immigration’s wage effects appear to be **small and localized to certain labor market segments**, rather than a sweeping depression of wages across the board[^2][^3].

It’s important to acknowledge that **not all economists agree entirely**, and some research does find more noticeable wage declines under specific conditions. A few studies using different methods or focusing on particular labor segments suggest that immigration can exert **downward pressure on wages** for certain groups of native workers – especially those with the least education who may directly compete for similar low-skill jobs. For example, Harvard economist George Borjas has argued that an influx of immigrants can significantly reduce wages for some low-education groups, estimating that a 10% increase in the immigrant workforce could lower wages for comparable native workers by around **3–4%** ([www.cato.org](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2017/does-immigration-reduce-wages#:~:text=U,Borjas%202003%20%2C%20%204)). Likewise, a study by the Center for Immigration Studies (an organization favoring reduced immigration) estimated that immigration in the US labor market contributed to a roughly **5% drop in average wages** of native-born workers over time, with much larger impacts (on the order of **10–12% lower wages**) for natives employed in predominantly low-skill occupations ([cis.org](https://cis.org/Report/Wages-Immigration#:~:text=The%20regression%20equations%20indicate%20that,skilled)) ([cis.org](https://cis.org/Report/Wages-Immigration#:~:text=,the%20immigrant%20composition%20of%20their)). These findings represent the higher end of estimated impacts; they suggest that *in theory* increasing the labor supply through immigration *could* push wages down in sectors where immigrants and natives are close substitutes. However, such outcomes are **heavily debated**. Other economists point out that these larger negative estimates often depend on specific modeling assumptions (for instance, treating all low-education workers as interchangeable) and may not account for the dynamic ways labor markets adjust[^5]. Indeed, the most restrictive estimates (like Borjas’s) contrast with many empirical studies that observe **little to no wage decline** in actual cities or industries that received immigrant surges ([cis.org](https://cis.org/Report/Immigration-and-Wages#:~:text=Does%20immigration%20lower%20the%20wages,affects%20wages%20in%20one%20city)) ([cis.org](https://cis.org/Report/Immigration-and-Wages#:~:text=The%20policy%20stakes%20are%20high%2C,wage%20trend%20in%20control%20cities)). In cases like the famous *Mariel boatlift* (when a sudden wave of Cuban refugees arrived in Miami in 1980), initial research found **no significant drop** in local wages, while a later re-analysis claimed a large wage drop for high-school dropouts – a claim subsequently challenged as a statistical artifact ([cis.org](https://cis.org/Report/Immigration-and-Wages#:~:text=The%20policy%20stakes%20are%20high%2C,wage%20trend%20in%20control%20cities)) ([cis.org](https://cis.org/Report/Immigration-and-Wages#:~:text=It%20did%20not%20take%20long,9)). This back-and-forth illustrates that results can vary with methodology, but **the bulk of evidence leans toward a modest impact**. Major literature surveys find that the *average wage elasticity* with respect to immigration is around **–0.2** (meaning a 10% increase in immigrant workers might lower native wages by only ~2%) ([www.cato.org](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2017/does-immigration-reduce-wages#:~:text=wage%20elasticity%20of%20immigration%E2%80%94the%20percentage,a%20greater%20wage%20elasticity%20of)). Even the more pessimistic estimates (elasticities of –0.3 or –0.4) imply relatively small wage adjustments spread over many years ([www.cato.org](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2017/does-immigration-reduce-wages#:~:text=U,Borjas%202003%20%2C%20%204)). 

**In summary, most economic research finds that immigration does not dramatically drive down wages.** The consensus is that **overall wage levels are barely affected** by immigration, because any added labor supply is offset by adjustments in the economy (like increased demand, investment, and specialization). While **certain workers who directly compete with immigrants in the labor market (such as earlier immigrants or those without a diploma)** may experience **slight wage declines**, those effects tend to be **minor in scale** (a few percent or less)[^4] and are often temporary as markets adapt. Other workers may even see small wage gains due to complementary skills and a larger economy. In the long run, immigration can contribute to economic growth, and there is **little evidence** that it is a major drag on native workers’ pay ([www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/news/nas-report-finds-immigration-win-us-economy#:~:text=U.S.,did%20not%20graduate%20high%20school)). Instead of being a primary force pushing wages down, immigration appears to be just one of many factors in a complex labor market – with **its overall wage impact being relatively muted** and concentrated in specific niches rather than across the entire workforce[^1][^2][^3].

A restrictionist perspective arguing that immigration *does exert downward pressure on wages*, especially in low-skill jobs. Camarota’s regression analysis suggested that a higher immigrant share in an occupation modestly *depressed average wages* (he estimated roughly a 5% lower wage for the average native worker due to immigration). The effect was much larger in *low-skilled occupations*: he found that immigration in predominantly low-education jobs may have *reduced native wages by about 10–12%* in those sectors. In contrast, he observed *no negative effect on wages in higher-skilled occupations*. This represents one of the more significant estimated impacts, though it differs from most later research ([cis.org](https://cis.org/Report/Wages-Immigration#:~:text=The%20regression%20equations%20indicate%20that,skilled)) ([cis.org](https://cis.org/Report/Wages-Immigration#:~:text=,the%20immigrant%20composition%20of%20their)). *URL:* [cis.org/Report/Wages-Immigration](https://cis.org/Report/Wages-Immigration)  

[^1]: *Note:* “Native” workers here means people born in the host country (e.g. U.S.-born or UK-born), as opposed to immigrant workers.  
[^2]: Multiple independent reviews (by academic economists, government committees, and international organizations) have reached similar conclusions that immigration’s overall impact on wages is very small. These include the UK Migration Advisory Committee (2018) and studies in countries like Canada, Germany, and Spain, which also generally find negligible average wage effects.  
[^3]: Other factors (technology, education levels, unions, minimum wage laws, etc.) have much larger influences on wage trends than immigration does. Immigration typically ranks low on the list of drivers for wage changes in the broader economy.  
[^4]: For context, a 0.2% wage change is extremely small – for a worker earning $15 per hour, 0.2% is only 3 cents. Over a full workweek, that’s roughly $1.20 difference, which is within normal fluctuation.  
[^5]: For example, some models that find bigger negative impacts assume native and immigrant workers are perfect substitutes within broad skill categories. If instead immigrants have slightly different skills or allow natives to specialize in other tasks, the negative impact would be dampened. This debate over modeling assumptions is a key reason why research results vary.
