Most economic research finds that immigration does **not** broadly drive down wages. In fact, the overall impact of immigration on average wages of native-born workers is very small – and often statistically insignificant – in the long run [1][2]. Some studies even find a slight positive effect on overall native wages, because while immigrants increase labor supply, they also boost demand for goods and services, which can create new jobs and raise productivity [2]. Comprehensive reviews of the literature (for example, a 2017 National Academies panel study in the US) conclude that **any** wage changes due to immigration are generally minimal over periods of a decade or more [1]. In other words, adding immigrant workers tends to expand the economy in ways that **offset** downward pressure on pay for most native workers [2].

**Distribution of effects:** The impact of immigration on wages tends to vary across different groups. Economists find that if wage competition occurs, it is usually **focused** among workers who are **most substitutable** for the new immigrants. For example, recent immigrants often compete with earlier immigrants who have similar skills, and those earlier immigrant workers may experience modest wage declines as a result [1][2]. Likewise, native-born workers with very low education (such as high school dropouts) can face some downward wage pressure in the short run if a large influx of similarly low-skilled immigrants enters the market [1][3]. However, these effects are generally **small in magnitude**. One analysis by economist George Borjas, who argues immigration can depress low-skill wages, estimated that a 10% increase in the supply of workers in a given skill group might reduce wages in that group by roughly 2–5% – a modest effect spread over time [3]. Other research using different methods finds even **smaller** or near-zero wage impacts on low-educated natives, with any negative effects largely confined to **prior immigrants** rather than native-born workers [2]. In fact, a study of U.S. data from 1994–2007 found immigration *slightly raised* average wages for U.S.-born workers (by about 0.4%) while *lowering* wages for earlier immigrant workers by a few percent – implying new immigrants primarily competed with other immigrants, not with native workers [2].

**Evidence from natural experiments:** Real-world cases reinforce the finding of little overall wage effect. A famous example is the 1980 *Mariel boatlift*, when about 125,000 Cuban refugees suddenly arrived in Miami, expanding the city’s labor force by 7% virtually overnight. According to economist David Card’s classic study, this large influx **did not** measurably reduce wages or employment for Miami’s native workers, even those in low-skill sectors [4]. Several follow-up studies similarly found no significant long-term depression of wages due to the boatlift [4]. Years later, another economist (George Borjas) re-analyzed the Mariel data and claimed that wages for Miami’s very least-educated group (native-born high school dropouts) fell sharply in the years after the influx. However, Borjas’s interpretation has been **widely challenged** by other researchers, who argue that his finding was an artifact of a small sample and failing to account for other economic changes in Miami (such as shifts in the demographic makeup of the workforce) [4]. When those factors are properly accounted for, the evidence still points to **minimal wage impact** from that immigration shock [4]. Overall, studies of sudden regional inflows – whether in Miami or elsewhere – often **do not** find the large wage drops that simple supply-and-demand theories might predict, because economies adjust in response to migration.

**Skill complementarities:** One key reason immigration usually doesn’t drag down wages is that immigrant workers and native workers are often **complements** rather than perfect substitutes. Immigrants often fill different niches in the labor market – for instance, taking difficult-to-fill jobs or bringing specialized skills – which can *increase* productivity for everyone. Higher-skilled immigrants, in particular, are frequently found to **boost innovation**, create businesses, and raise productivity, which can **increase** wages for many native workers over time [1]. Even lower-skilled immigrants can complement native-born workers by doing jobs that allow natives to move into higher-paying roles. This complementarity means natives and immigrants aren’t simply competing for one fixed set of jobs; instead, immigration can *reallocate* labor in ways that make the economy more efficient. As a result, the net effect on native wages tends to be close to zero or slightly positive in aggregate, rather than a broad wage depression [1][2].

**Findings in other countries:** Research in other advanced economies echoes the U.S. experience. In the United Kingdom, for example, studies have found that immigration in the late 1990s and 2000s had a **small positive effect** on average wages of native-born workers [5]. One U.K. study showed that immigration contributed modestly to overall wage growth, especially benefiting middle- and high-wage workers [5]. At the same time, it found **only a slight “downdraft” at the bottom** of the wage distribution – i.e. wages for the lowest-paid native workers grew a bit more slowly than they would have without the new immigration, but **did not fall in absolute terms** [5]. In other words, even in sectors with many immigrant workers, wages continued to rise, just at a marginally slower pace than otherwise. This aligns with a general pattern observed by economists: immigration may *temporarily* hold down wage growth for some specific groups or regions, but those effects are usually small and tend to dissipate as markets adjust.

**Conclusion:** Overall, the best empirical evidence indicates that immigration **does not significantly drive down wages** for the existing workforce in the aggregate. The impact on wages is typically very modest, and often positive for many workers [1][2]. There can be some redistribution: certain workers (especially previous immigrants or those without a high school diploma) might experience **slightly lower wage growth** due to new competition, while other workers may see their wages **lifted** by the complementary skills and economic growth that immigrants bring [1][3][5]. However, these distributional effects are generally small – on the order of a few percentage points at most for affected groups, not massive wage cuts. In the longer run, economies tend to absorb immigrant labor by increasing output, investing in new businesses, and creating new jobs. This expansionary adjustment means immigration’s overall impact on wages is close to neutral and may even be mildly positive. In sum, immigration has **only a limited effect on wages**, and it **does not** deserve the broad blame for low wages or wage stagnation; factors like automation, education, and economic policy play much larger roles in determining wage levels than immigration does [1][2][5].

The **wage benefit** was small but positive for most natives (immigration accounted for roughly 0.15 percentage points of annual wage growth).
