The question of whether immigration drives down wages is a contentious topic in economics, with research yielding mixed findings depending on factors such as the skill levels of immigrants and natives, the time frame considered, local labor market conditions, and the overall economy. Overall, the preponderance of evidence from rigorous studies suggests that immigration does not significantly drive down wages for most native-born workers in the long term. Instead, it often has neutral or slightly positive effects on the economy as a whole, though there may be short-term downward pressure on wages for specific groups, such as low-skilled native workers in certain regions [1][2]. However, some studies argue for more pronounced negative effects, particularly in high-immigration areas [3]. Below, I'll break this down by examining the key arguments, evidence, and nuances.

### Arguments and Evidence That Immigration Does Not Drive Down Wages
A large body of research indicates that immigration has minimal or no negative impact on native wages, and in some cases, it can boost them. Immigrants often fill labor shortages, start businesses, and increase demand for goods and services, which stimulates economic growth and indirectly supports wage levels [1][4].

- **Complementarity in Skills**: Immigrants frequently complement rather than substitute for native workers. For example, low-skilled immigrants may take jobs in agriculture, construction, or services that natives are less likely to fill, allowing natives to move into higher-skilled roles. High-skilled immigrants (e.g., in tech or healthcare) can enhance productivity and innovation, leading to higher wages overall [2]. A comprehensive 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine analyzed decades of data and concluded that immigration has "little to no negative effects on the overall wages or employment of native-born workers" in the long run, with any short-term effects being small and localized [1].

- **Empirical Case Studies**: One landmark study examined the 1980 Mariel Boatlift, when 125,000 Cuban immigrants arrived in Miami, increasing the local labor force by 7%. Economist David Card found no evidence of wage declines or increased unemployment among low-skilled natives, including Black and Hispanic workers; instead, the local economy absorbed the influx without harm [5]. Similarly, research on European countries during periods of high immigration (e.g., post-2004 EU enlargement) showed that wages for natives either remained stable or slightly increased due to economic expansion [2].

- **Long-Term Economic Benefits**: Immigrants contribute to GDP growth, which can lead to higher wages. For instance, a 2023 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office projected that increased immigration to the U.S. would add $7 trillion to GDP over the next decade, supporting wage growth through higher productivity and consumer spending [4]. Studies also show that second-generation immigrants often outperform natives in education and earnings, further boosting the economy [1].

### Arguments and Evidence That Immigration Does Drive Down Wages
Critics argue that immigration increases labor supply, which can suppress wages, especially for low-skilled workers who compete directly with immigrants. This view is often based on supply-and-demand models in economics.

- **Negative Impacts on Specific Groups**: Economist George Borjas has argued that immigration reduces wages for native high school dropouts by 3-5% in the short term, based on national-level data from the U.S. Census [3]. His research suggests that between 1980 and 2000, immigration accounted for about a third of the wage decline for this group, as immigrants (often low-skilled) crowd into similar jobs. Borjas contends that studies like Card's overlook national effects by focusing too narrowly on local markets [3].

- **Regional and Short-Term Effects**: In areas with sudden immigrant influxes, wages can dip temporarily. For example, a study of the U.S. construction industry found that higher immigration correlated with 1-2% lower wages for native workers in that sector during the 2000s housing boom [6]. International evidence, such as from Israel's absorption of Soviet immigrants in the 1990s, showed short-term wage drops of up to 3% for low-skilled natives before markets adjusted [2].

However, even these studies often note that effects fade over time as economies adaptâ€”immigrants create jobs, natives upskill, and businesses expand [1][3].

### Nuances and Broader Context
The impact varies by context:
- **Skill Level**: High-skilled immigration tends to raise wages for all, while low-skilled immigration may slightly depress wages for competing natives (e.g., a 0-2% drop) but benefit others [1][3].
- **Time Horizon**: Short-term effects (e.g., 1-5 years) can be negative, but long-term effects (10+ years) are generally neutral or positive [2].
- **Policy and Economy**: Strong labor protections, education investments, and economic growth mitigate any downsides. In recessions, effects may be more pronounced [4].
- **Overall Consensus**: Meta-analyses, including one by the World Bank, find that immigration's wage effects are "small and close to zero" on average, with benefits outweighing costs for host countries [2]. This aligns with views from organizations like the Brookings Institution, which emphasize immigration's role in addressing labor shortages amid aging populations [4].

In summary, while there is evidence of limited wage suppression for certain low-skilled groups in specific scenarios, the broader economic literature indicates that immigration does not drive down wages overall and often contributes positively to wage growth and prosperity. Policymakers can minimize any adverse effects through targeted training programs for natives and integration support for immigrants.
