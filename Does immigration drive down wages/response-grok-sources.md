The impact of immigration on wages is a highly debated topic in economics, with research yielding mixed results depending on factors such as the skill level of immigrants, the local labor market, the time frame considered, and the methodology used. Overall, while some studies suggest that immigration can exert downward pressure on wages for certain groups of native workers—particularly low-skilled or less-educated ones—other research finds minimal or even positive effects on average wages. These effects are often short-term and localized, and broader economic benefits like increased productivity and consumer demand can offset wage pressures over time [1][2]. Below, I'll outline the key evidence, drawing from empirical studies and economic analyses.

### Evidence Suggesting Immigration Drives Down Wages
Some economists argue that an influx of immigrants, especially those with similar skills to native workers, increases labor supply and thus competition, leading to lower wages for natives in affected sectors. For instance, research by George Borjas, a prominent labor economist, examines the U.S. labor market and concludes that immigration has reduced wages for low-skilled native workers. In his analysis of data from 1960 to 2010, Borjas estimates that immigration lowered the wages of high school dropouts (a group often competing directly with low-skilled immigrants) by about 3-5% over the long term. He emphasizes that these effects are more pronounced in the short run and for workers without college degrees, as immigrants tend to cluster in low-wage jobs like agriculture, construction, and services [2]. This view is supported by studies on specific industries; for example, in U.S. agriculture, where many immigrants work as farm laborers, increased immigration has been linked to stagnant or declining real wages for native farmworkers, partly due to the seasonal and low-skill nature of the work [1].

Additional research reinforces this perspective. A 2017 study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine reviewed decades of data and found that immigration has a small negative impact on the wages of prior immigrants and low-skilled natives, estimating a 1-2% wage reduction for every 10% increase in the labor force due to immigration [3]. This effect is often most visible in local markets with sudden immigrant inflows, such as during economic booms or refugee crises.

### Evidence Suggesting Immigration Does Not Significantly Drive Down Wages
Conversely, many studies find that immigration has little to no negative effect on native wages overall, and it may even boost them in some cases. Economists like David Card have challenged the wage-depression narrative through natural experiments. Card's famous 1990 study on the Mariel Boatlift—a sudden influx of 125,000 Cuban immigrants to Miami in 1980—showed no significant wage decline for low-skilled natives in the area compared to control cities. Instead, the local economy absorbed the immigrants without harming native employment or pay, possibly due to increased demand for goods and services [4].

This perspective is echoed in broader analyses. A 2015 meta-analysis by economists from the University of California, Davis, and others reviewed over 20 studies and concluded that immigration's impact on wages is generally small and short-lived, often dissipating as economies adjust through business expansion and skill upgrading among natives [1]. For high-skilled immigration, effects can be positive: immigrants in tech and STEM fields, for example, contribute to innovation and productivity growth, which raises overall wages. A Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report from 2020 estimated that increased immigration could boost U.S. GDP and per capita income, with minimal long-term wage suppression for most workers [5].

Factors influencing these outcomes include:
- **Skill complementarity**: High-skilled immigrants often complement rather than compete with natives, creating jobs and raising wages [2][4].
- **Geographic and temporal scope**: Wage effects are more likely in isolated, short-term scenarios but fade nationally over time [1][3].
- **Economic context**: During recessions, competition may intensify, but in growing economies, immigration stimulates demand [5].

### Nuanced Conclusions and Policy Implications
The consensus among economists, as reflected in surveys like those from the IGM Chicago Booth panel, is that immigration does not substantially harm average native wages in the long run, though it may redistribute income by pressuring low-skilled workers while benefiting employers and high-skilled natives [6]. Disagreements often stem from methodological differences, such as whether studies account for immigrants' assimilation or natives' mobility. For accurate policy, experts recommend focusing on integration programs, education, and targeted support for affected workers rather than broad restrictions on immigration.

In summary, immigration can drive down wages for specific subgroups in certain contexts, but evidence suggests it does not broadly suppress wages across the economy. The net effect depends on various factors, and most research points to overall economic gains.
