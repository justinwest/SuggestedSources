The impact of immigration on wages is a highly debated topic in economics, with research yielding mixed results depending on factors such as the skill level of immigrants, the time frame analyzed, the specific labor markets affected, and the methodologies used. Overall, while some studies suggest that immigration can exert downward pressure on wages for certain groups—particularly low-skilled native workers in the short term—other research finds minimal or even positive effects on average wages, often due to complementary skills, economic growth, and labor market adjustments. The evidence is not uniform, and effects can vary by country, region, and economic context. Below, I outline the key arguments and evidence from both sides, drawing on the suggested sources and additional reputable studies for a balanced perspective.

### Evidence Suggesting Immigration Drives Down Wages
Several economists argue that an influx of immigrants, especially those with low skills, increases labor supply in certain sectors, leading to competition that reduces wages for similar native workers. This view is rooted in basic supply-and-demand principles: more workers competing for jobs can lower the price of labor.

- **Short-term impacts on low-skilled workers**: Research by economist George Borjas, a prominent voice in this debate, estimates that immigration to the United States between 1980 and 2000 reduced the wages of native high school dropouts by about 9% in the short run and 5% in the long run. Borjas argues that immigrants often cluster in low-wage occupations, displacing or undercutting native workers without high school diplomas [1][2]. He emphasizes that while the overall economy may benefit from cheaper labor, the costs are borne disproportionately by less-educated natives, exacerbating income inequality.

- **Historical and aggregate data**: Analysis of U.S. labor market trends shows that periods of high immigration correlate with stagnating or declining real wages for blue-collar workers. For instance, from 1979 to 2019, the share of foreign-born workers in the U.S. labor force rose from 6.5% to 17%, coinciding with a 20% drop in real weekly earnings for men without a college degree. This pattern is attributed partly to immigration increasing competition in industries like construction, manufacturing, and services, where offshoring and immigration have "sold out" American workers by suppressing wage growth [3]. Borjas further notes that even in high-immigration cities, wage gaps widen for vulnerable groups, with little evidence of natives fully "upskilling" to avoid competition [2].

- **Broader economic models**: A comprehensive review by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2017) found that immigration has a small negative effect on the wages of prior immigrants and low-skilled natives, estimating a 1-2% wage reduction per decade of immigration inflows, though effects fade over time as markets adjust [4].

### Evidence Suggesting Immigration Does Not Drive Down Wages (or Has Minimal/Positive Effects)
Counterarguments highlight that immigrants often fill labor shortages, create jobs through entrepreneurship and consumption, and complement rather than substitute for native workers. This can lead to overall wage growth, with any negative effects being short-lived or localized.

- **Minimal aggregate impact**: Studies examining natural experiments, such as the 1980 Mariel Boatlift (when 125,000 Cuban immigrants arrived in Miami), found no significant wage decline for low-skilled natives. Economist David Card's analysis showed that wages for Miami's high school dropouts actually rose slightly relative to comparison cities, suggesting rapid labor market absorption [5]. Similarly, more recent research on the same event, updated with better data, confirmed no adverse wage effects, challenging claims of downward pressure [6].

- **Complementary skills and long-term benefits**: Immigrants often bring diverse skills that boost productivity. For example, high-skilled immigrants in tech and STEM fields can increase innovation and wages for complementary native workers. Economist Giovanni Peri's work indicates that a 1% increase in the immigrant share of the workforce raises average native wages by 0.5-0.6% in the long run, as immigrants push natives into higher-skilled roles and stimulate demand [7]. The UC Davis analysis echoes this, noting that while low-skilled immigration may slightly depress wages in specific sectors (e.g., agriculture), overall effects are neutral or positive due to economic expansion [1].

- **Regional and sectoral nuances**: In areas with high immigration, such as California, wage stagnation in low-skill jobs is often attributed more to globalization, automation, and policy factors than immigration alone. The National Academies report concludes that immigration's net effect on average U.S. wages is close to zero, with potential small positives for skilled natives [4].

### Balanced Conclusion and Policy Implications
The evidence suggests that immigration does not universally drive down wages but can do so for specific subgroups, like low-skilled natives, in the short term and in concentrated markets. Long-term effects tend to be neutral or positive as economies adapt, with immigrants contributing to growth (e.g., adding $2 trillion to U.S. GDP annually, per some estimates [7]). Factors like education levels, legal status of immigrants, and enforcement of labor laws play crucial roles in mitigating negative impacts. Policymakers could address concerns through targeted training programs for natives, minimum wage adjustments, or skill-based immigration reforms. The debate remains contentious, with methodological differences (e.g., Borjas focuses on national models, while Card uses local comparisons) explaining divergent findings. For a definitive answer in a specific context, more granular data is needed.
