The question of whether immigration drives down wages is one of the most debated topics in economics and public policy. The answer is not a simple yes or no; rather, it is highly nuanced. The consensus among most economists is that while immigration can place some downward pressure on the wages of a small, specific group of native-born workers in the short term, its overall long-term effect on average native-born wages is minimal and may even be slightly positive [3, 4].

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the factors at play.

### 1. The Basic Economic Theory: Supply and Demand

The most straightforward argument for why immigration might lower wages is based on the simple model of supply and demand. In this model:
*   **Labor is a commodity.**
*   **Wages are the price of labor.**
*   **An influx of immigrants increases the supply of labor.**

All else being equal, an increase in the supply of any commodity leads to a decrease in its price. Therefore, a larger pool of workers competing for the same number of jobs should theoretically push wages down. This effect would be most pronounced if immigrant workers are perfect substitutes for native-born workers, meaning they have similar skills and compete for the same jobs [2].

### 2. Complicating Factors: Why the Simple Theory is Incomplete

The real world is far more complex than the basic supply-and-demand model suggests. Several factors complicate the relationship between immigration and wages, often offsetting the downward pressure on wages.

*   **Immigrants are also Consumers:** Immigrants do not just supply labor; they also demand goods and services. They rent apartments, buy food, get haircuts, and purchase cars. This increased demand stimulates economic growth, leading businesses to expand and create more jobs. This new job creation helps absorb the larger labor supply, counteracting the initial downward wage pressure [4].

*   **Complementarity vs. Substitution:** Immigrants and native-born workers are often not perfect substitutes. In many cases, their skills are complementary. This means the skills of one group enhance the productivity and wages of the other. For example:
    *   An influx of low-skilled immigrant construction workers can create more demand for higher-skilled, native-born construction managers, architects, and real estate agents.
    *   A high-skilled immigrant engineer might start a tech company that hires native-born technicians, marketers, and administrative staff.
    In these cases, immigration can directly *raise* the wages of complementary native-born workers [4].

*   **Capital Adjustment:** Economies are dynamic. When the supply of labor increases and becomes cheaper, businesses are incentivized to invest in new capital—such as machinery, technology, and new facilities—to take advantage of the larger workforce. This expansion of capital increases overall productivity and the demand for labor in the long run, which can restore or even increase wages [3].

*   **Entrepreneurship:** Immigrants have a significantly higher rate of entrepreneurship than native-born citizens. By starting new businesses, they create jobs for both immigrants and natives, contributing to economic dynamism and offsetting any displacement effects [3].

### 3. Empirical Evidence and Key Studies

To move beyond theory, economists have used "natural experiments" to study the real-world effects of immigration. The most famous of these is the **Mariel Boatlift**.

In 1980, Fidel Castro permitted about 125,000 Cubans, mostly low-skilled laborers, to emigrate to the United States. Many settled in Miami, increasing the city’s labor force by 7% almost overnight.

*   **The Card Study (1990):** Economist David Card studied the impact of this sudden influx on Miami’s labor market. He compared the wage and unemployment trends in Miami to those in four similar cities (Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, and Tampa). His landmark finding was that the Mariel Boatlift had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of Miami's existing low-skilled workers, including earlier Cuban immigrants [1]. This study provided powerful evidence that an economy can absorb a large influx of labor without significant negative consequences for native workers.

*   **The Borjas Re-Analysis (2017):** Economist George Borjas, a prominent critic of the consensus view, later re-analyzed the Mariel data. By focusing on a very narrow demographic—native-born male high school dropouts between the ages of 25 and 59—he found that this specific group did experience a significant wage decline of 10% to 30% [2].

The debate between the Card and Borjas findings highlights the complexity of the issue. Most economists believe that while Borjas may have identified a real effect on a very small subset of the native population, the broader picture presented by Card and others remains more accurate for the overall economy. The group Borjas studied represents less than 1% of the workforce [1, 2].

### 4. Differentiated Impacts on Different Groups

The impact of immigration is not uniform across the entire population. The consensus from a comprehensive 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) is as follows:

*   **High-Skilled Natives:** This group generally sees a small but clear wage *increase* from immigration due to complementarity. They benefit from the new skills, innovation, and business creation that immigrants bring [3].
*   **Low-Skilled Natives:** The effect on this group is the most debated. The NASEM report concluded that the effect on the wages of native-born workers with low levels of education is, on average, very small. Any negative effects are concentrated on those who did not complete high school [3].
*   **Previous Immigrants:** The group that faces the most significant negative wage pressure from new immigration is often prior immigrants. This is because they are the most likely to be direct substitutes for new arrivals in terms of skills, language, and social networks [3].

### Conclusion

In summary, the claim that immigration drives down wages for the general population is not supported by the bulk of economic research. The evidence points to the following conclusions:

1.  **Overall Impact is Minimal:** For the vast majority of native-born workers, the net effect of immigration on wages is negligible, hovering close to zero.
2.  **Negative Impacts are Concentrated:** The small negative wage effects that do exist are concentrated on a very specific and small subgroup of the population: native-born workers without a high school diploma and, more significantly, recent immigrants who have similar skills to the new arrivals.
3.  **Positive Impacts Exist:** High-skilled native workers often see their wages increase. Furthermore, the economy as a whole benefits from the increased demand, entrepreneurship, and innovation that immigrants provide, which creates jobs and promotes long-term growth.
4.  **The Economy Adapts:** The labor market is not static. It adjusts to immigration through capital investment, shifts in production, and the creation of new businesses, which help absorb the new labor supply over time.

    *   **Author's View:** In this foundational study, Card argues that the massive and unexpected influx of low-skilled Cuban immigrants to Miami in 1980 had virtually no measurable negative effect on the wages or unemployment rates of existing low-skilled workers in the city. His work suggests that local economies are far more capable of absorbing immigrant labor than simple supply-and-demand models would predict.

    *   **Author's View:** Borjas is a leading voice arguing that immigration has a negative effect on the wages of low-skilled native workers. In this paper, he re-examines the Mariel Boatlift data and, by using a different comparison group (focusing specifically on native-born high school dropouts), concludes that the boatlift did cause a substantial short-run decline in the wages for this particular group. He argues that studies that find no effect are often looking at too broad a group of workers.

    *   **Author's View:** Giovanni Peri is a leading researcher on the concept of complementarity. His work argues that immigrants, by bringing diverse skill sets, push native-born workers into higher-skilled, communication-intensive jobs, boosting overall productivity and wages. He argues that treating immigrants and natives as substitutes is a fundamental mistake and that their complementary skills are a key reason why immigration does not depress wages for most natives.
