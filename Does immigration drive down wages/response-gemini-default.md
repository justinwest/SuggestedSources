The question of whether immigration drives down wages is a central and often contentious topic in economics. The answer is not a simple yes or no; it is highly nuanced and depends on a range of factors, including the skill levels of immigrants, the skills of native-born workers, the time frame considered, and the overall health of the economy.

While basic economic theory suggests an increase in labor supply could lower wages, the empirical evidence from numerous studies indicates that the overall effect on the wages of native-born workers is very small, and for many, it is non-existent or even positive. The negative impacts, when found, are typically concentrated on a small segment of the population.

### 1. The Basic Economic Theory: Supply and Demand

The simplest model for analyzing the effect of immigration on wages is based on supply and demand. In this framework, an influx of immigrants increases the supply of labor. If the demand for labor remains unchanged, this increase in supply should, in theory, lead to a lower equilibrium wage for workers in that market [1]. This is the foundational argument for the belief that immigration reduces wages.

However, this model is overly simplistic because it fails to account for several critical real-world dynamics.

### 2. Complicating Factors and Real-World Dynamics

The economy is not a static system. The arrival of immigrants triggers a series of adjustments that complicate the simple supply-and-demand narrative.

*   **Immigrants are also Consumers:** Immigrants do not just supply labor; they also demand goods and services. They rent apartments, buy groceries, and use transportation, which increases overall economic demand. This increased demand leads businesses to expand, which in turn boosts the demand for labor, helping to offset the initial increase in labor supply [2].
*   **Complementary vs. Substitute Labor:** Not all workers are interchangeable. The impact of immigration on wages heavily depends on whether immigrants are *substitutes* for or *complements* to native-born workers.
    *   **Substitutes:** If immigrants have similar skills and compete for the same jobs as a group of native workers, they are considered substitutes. This is where a negative wage effect is most likely to occur. For example, low-skilled immigrants might compete with low-skilled native-born workers, potentially putting downward pressure on their wages [3].
    *   **Complements:** If immigrants have skills that complement those of the native workforce, they can increase productivity and wages for native workers. For example, an immigrant engineer (high-skilled) might create jobs for native-born construction workers and technicians (medium-skilled). Similarly, low-skilled immigrant workers in childcare or agriculture can free up high-skilled native workers to pursue more productive jobs, boosting overall economic output [4].
*   **Filling Labor Gaps and Spurring Innovation:** Immigrants often fill jobs that native workers are less willing to take, particularly in physically demanding sectors or those with unsociable hours. Furthermore, high-skilled immigrants have a disproportionately high rate of entrepreneurship and innovation. They are more likely to start businesses and file patents, which creates new jobs and economic growth that benefit the entire economy, including native-born workers [1, 5].
*   **Long-Run vs. Short-Run Effects:** In the short run, a sudden influx of immigrants can create temporary disruptions and potentially lower wages in specific sectors as the economy adjusts. However, in the long run, the economy adapts. Businesses invest in more capital to equip the new workers, and the increased demand generated by immigrants ripples through the economy, often leading to neutral or positive wage effects over time [6].

### 3. Empirical Evidence: What the Studies Show

Decades of economic research have attempted to measure the real-world impact of immigration on wages. The overwhelming consensus from this body of work is that the impact on the wages of native-born workers is, on average, very small.

*   **Overall Impact:** A landmark 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) reviewed the existing literature and concluded that when measured over a period of 10 years or more, the impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers is "very small" [1]. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reached a similar conclusion, stating that "most studies have found that, on average, the wages of native-born workers are affected only modestly by immigration" [2].
*   **Impact on Low-Skilled Natives:** The group most likely to experience negative wage effects is native-born workers who did not graduate from high school, as they are most likely to be in direct competition with low-skilled immigrants. Even for this group, the effects found are generally small. However, some economists, notably George Borjas, argue these effects can be significant for this specific subgroup [3].
*   **The Mariel Boatlift Case Study:** A famous natural experiment, the 1980 Mariel Boatlift, involved a sudden influx of 125,000 Cuban immigrants, mostly low-skilled, into Miami. Economist David Card's influential 1990 study found no discernible negative effect on the wages or unemployment rates of Miami's low-skilled workers compared to other similar cities [7]. Decades later, economist George Borjas re-examined the data, focusing on a narrower group (non-Hispanic male high-school dropouts) and argued that this specific group did see a significant wage decline [3]. This ongoing debate highlights how different methodological choices can lead to different conclusions, but it also underscores that any negative effects are likely concentrated on a very specific, small segment of the workforce.
*   **Impact on Prior Immigrants:** The group that consistently experiences the most significant negative wage impact from new immigration is prior immigrants. This is because new arrivals are often direct substitutes for those who came before them, sharing language skills and social networks that lead them to compete for the same jobs [1].
*   **Impact of High-Skilled Immigrants:** Research on high-skilled immigration consistently finds positive effects. High-skilled immigrants are associated with innovation and economic growth, which tends to increase wages for native-born workers, including those with lower skill levels, through job creation and productivity gains [5].

### Conclusion

The claim that immigration drives down wages is an oversimplification of a complex economic reality. The vast majority of economic research indicates that for the average native-born worker, the wage effect of immigration is negligible and may even be positive in the long run.

The economic costs, in the form of potential wage depression, are not borne by the native-born population as a whole. Instead, they are narrowly concentrated on a small group of workers with the lowest education levels and on immigrants who arrived in previous waves. Conversely, the economic benefits—including increased innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth fueled by both consumer demand and a more complementary workforce—are broadly distributed across the population. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment must weigh the small, concentrated costs against these widely dispersed benefits.
