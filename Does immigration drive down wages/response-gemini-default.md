The question of whether immigration drives down wages is one of the most debated topics in economics. The answer is not a simple yes or no; it depends on various factors, including the skill levels of immigrants, the time frame considered, and the specific group of native-born workers being studied. While basic economic theory suggests an increase in labor supply could lower wages, the empirical evidence presents a much more complex picture.

### 1. The Basic Economic Theory

The most straightforward argument for immigration lowering wages is based on the simple model of supply and demand. If we hold all else constant, an influx of immigrants increases the supply of labor. An increased supply of any good or service, including labor, will typically lead to a lower price for it. In this context, the "price" of labor is the wage. This model predicts that native-born workers who have skills similar to those of new immigrants will face more competition, potentially leading to downward pressure on their wages or slower wage growth [1].

However, this simple model has significant limitations because it fails to account for several other crucial economic effects that immigration can trigger.

### 2. More Complex Economic Realities

More sophisticated economic analyses show that immigrants are not just additional workers; their presence changes the economy in multiple ways that can offset or even reverse the simple supply-and-demand effect.

*   **Immigrants as Complements, Not Just Substitutes:** Immigrants often have different skill sets than native-born workers. When their skills *complement* those of native workers, they can increase productivity and wages. For example, an immigrant engineer (high-skilled) might create jobs for native-born construction workers and technicians (medium-skilled). Similarly, a low-skilled immigrant might take a job in agriculture or childcare, freeing up a native-born worker to pursue a higher-skilled, better-paying job that requires stronger English language skills [2]. In these cases, immigration can lead to wage *increases* for some native workers.
*   **Increased Demand for Goods and Services:** Immigrants are also consumers. They rent apartments, buy groceries, purchase cars, and use local services. This increases the overall demand in the economy, which in turn leads to business expansion and job creation. This new demand for labor can counteract the initial effect of the increased labor supply [3].
*   **Innovation and Entrepreneurship:** Immigrants have historically shown high rates of entrepreneurship. They start businesses at a higher rate than the native-born population, creating jobs for both immigrants and natives. Furthermore, high-skilled immigrants contribute significantly to innovation, science, and technology, which boosts long-term economic productivity and growth for everyone [1].

### 3. Empirical Evidence and Key Findings

Decades of research have tried to measure the actual impact of immigration on wages. The broad consensus is that the overall effect on the wages of native-born workers is very small, and on average, is more likely to be slightly positive than negative.

*   **Overall Impact:** A landmark 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) conducted a comprehensive review of the evidence. It concluded that over a period of 10 years or more, the net impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers is close to zero, with some studies pointing to a small positive effect [1]. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reached a similar conclusion, finding that while immigration may slightly reduce wages for some low-skilled workers in the short term, it also boosts investment, productivity, and the incomes of many others, leading to a net positive effect on the economy [4].

*   **Impact on Different Worker Groups:** The small overall average masks more significant effects on specific subgroups:
    *   **High-Skilled Natives:** The evidence consistently shows that high-skilled native workers tend to benefit from immigration, experiencing wage increases due to the complementary skills of immigrants and boosts in innovation [2, 5].
    *   **Low-Skilled Natives:** This is the most contested area. Some studies find a small negative impact on the wages of native-born workers who did not complete high school, as they are the most likely to be in direct competition with low-skilled immigrants. Economist George Borjas, a prominent scholar in the field, argues that the influx of low-skilled immigrants has significantly reduced the wages of native-born high school dropouts [6]. However, other economists, such as Giovanni Peri and David Card, argue that these negative effects are much smaller or non-existent, even for low-skilled natives, because of the complementary effects and labor market adjustments mentioned earlier [2, 7].
    *   **Previous Immigrants:** The group most consistently found to be negatively affected by new immigration is prior immigrants. This is because they are the most direct substitutes for new arrivals in terms of skills, language, and social networks [1].

### 4. The Mariel Boatlift: A Famous Case Study

The debate is famously illustrated by studies of the 1980 Mariel boatlift, when roughly 125,000 Cuban immigrants, mostly low-skilled, arrived in Miami over a six-month period.
*   In his influential 1990 study, economist David Card compared Miami’s labor market to that of similar cities and found no discernible negative effect on the wages or employment of Miami’s existing low-skilled workers [7].
*   Years later, George Borjas re-examined the data, focusing more narrowly on native-born high school dropouts, and concluded that the boatlift did, in fact, cause a sharp and substantial drop in their wages [6].
*   Subsequent re-analyses by other economists have challenged Borjas's findings, with some supporting Card's original conclusion [8]. This ongoing debate highlights how sensitive the results can be to the specific methodology and data used.

### Conclusion

In summary, the claim that immigration broadly drives down wages for the native-born population is not supported by the majority of economic research. The evidence suggests the following:

1.  **Overall Average Impact is Minimal:** For the native-born workforce as a whole, the long-term effect of immigration on wages is negligible and may even be slightly positive.
2.  **Effects Vary by Group:** High-skilled native workers often see their wages increase. The most vulnerable group is native-born workers without a high school diploma, who may experience small wage declines due to direct competition, though the size of this effect is heavily debated among economists.
3.  **Prior Immigrants Are Most Affected:** The group that faces the most significant negative wage pressure from new immigration is often immigrants who arrived in previous waves.
4.  **Economic Benefits Are Widespread:** The economic contributions of immigrants as consumers, entrepreneurs, and innovators tend to create jobs and boost overall economic productivity, benefiting the economy as a whole in the long run.

Ultimately, the economic impact of immigration is not a simple zero-sum game. While there can be concentrated negative effects on a small subset of the population, these are generally outweighed by the broader economic benefits that immigration brings.
