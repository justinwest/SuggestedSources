The question of whether immigration drives down wages is a central topic in labor economics, and the answer is not a simple yes or no. The broad consensus among economists is that while immigration may have some negative effects on the wages of a small subset of the native-born population in the short term, the overall long-term impact on average native-born wages is minimal and can even be slightly positive [5]. The effect of immigration on wages depends heavily on the skills of the immigrants, the skills of the native-born workers with whom they might compete, and the ability of the economy to adjust over time [1, 5].

### Overall Economic Impact and Average Wages
Most large-scale studies and meta-analyses conclude that the net effect of immigration on the average wages of native-born workers is close to zero [5]. Immigrants are not only workers; they are also consumers who increase demand for goods and services. This increased demand helps create jobs. Furthermore, the arrival of new labor can encourage firms to invest in more capital (e.g., new machinery, new buildings), which expands productive capacity and prevents wages from falling. This process of economic adjustment means that in the long run, the economy can absorb new workers without a negative impact on average wages [1, 5].

Economists Giovanni Peri and Gianmarco Ottaviano argue that immigrant labor is often a complement to, rather than a perfect substitute for, native-born labor. Because immigrants often have different skills, educational backgrounds, and language abilities, they tend to take different types of jobs. This specialization allows native-born workers to move into higher-skilled, communication-intensive roles where they have a comparative advantage, often leading to increased productivity and higher wages for natives [1, 4]. For example, an influx of immigrant construction workers might increase the demand and wages for native-born construction managers, architects, and real estate agents [1].

### Effects on Specific Groups of Workers
The academic debate becomes more intense when looking at the effects on specific segments of the population, particularly low-skilled native-born workers.

*   **Negative Effects on Competing Workers:** The group most likely to experience negative wage pressure from new immigration is prior immigrants who have similar skills, as they are the most direct substitutes in the labor market. A smaller negative impact is sometimes found for native-born workers without a high school diploma [2, 5]. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that for native-born workers with less than a high school education, there is some evidence of a negative wage impact, though the magnitude is debated [5].

*   **The Mariel Boatlift Debate:** A famous case study that highlights this debate is the 1980 Mariel boatlift, a sudden influx of roughly 125,000 mostly low-skilled Cuban immigrants to Miami.
    *   In a highly influential 1990 paper, economist David Card studied this event and found no discernible negative effect on the wages or employment rates of low-skilled non-Cuban workers in Miami when compared to similar workers in other U.S. cities [3]. For decades, this study was cited as prime evidence that even large, unexpected influxes of low-skilled labor have little impact on wages.
    *   However, economist George Borjas re-examined the Mariel boatlift data with a different methodology. By focusing on a narrower group of workers most likely to be in direct competition—specifically, non-Hispanic men aged 25-59 without a high school diploma—he found a large and statistically significant drop in their wages in Miami during the 1980s [2].

This ongoing debate over the Mariel boatlift illustrates how sensitive the findings can be to the specific methodology and comparison groups used.

### Conclusion
In summary, the majority of economic research finds that immigration does not drive down the average wages of native-born workers. In the long run, the effect is generally considered to be negligible or even slightly positive due to factors like increased demand, capital investment, and the complementary nature of immigrant skills [1, 5]. However, there is evidence that immigration can create short-term, negative wage pressure on specific, relatively small groups, particularly prior immigrants and native-born workers with very low levels of education who are in direct competition for the same jobs [2, 5]. Therefore, a comprehensive view suggests that the negative wage effects of immigration are not widespread but are instead concentrated among a narrow subset of the workforce.

    *   **Author's View:** Peri argues that immigrants often complement the skills of native-born workers rather than competing directly with them. This dynamic pushes natives toward more complex, communication-intensive jobs, boosting overall productivity and potentially raising wages for natives in the long run. He finds little to no evidence of a negative wage impact on natives.

In this paper, he re-examines the Mariel boatlift and concludes that it caused a substantial decline in the wages of Miami's least-skilled non-Hispanic workers, directly contradicting earlier findings by David Card.

    *   **Author's View:** Card's original study of the Mariel boatlift found that the massive and sudden influx of low-skilled immigrants had virtually no effect on the wages or employment levels of existing low-skilled workers in Miami. This paper became a cornerstone of the view that labor markets can absorb immigrant inflows without significant negative wage consequences.
