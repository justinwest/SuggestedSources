The question of whether immigration drives down wages is a central topic in economics, with research showing that the effects are nuanced and vary significantly across different segments of the population and time frames. While the simplest economic models suggest that an increase in labor supply would lower wages, the reality is more complex [1, 2]. Overall, most studies find that immigration has a small or negligible impact on the average wages of native-born workers, but it can have a more pronounced negative effect on specific groups, particularly previous immigrants and native-born workers with low levels of education [1, 3].

### The Core Economic Arguments

A basic supply and demand model suggests that when the supply of labor increases due to immigration, the price of that labor—wages—should fall, assuming all other factors remain constant. This is the foundation of the argument that immigration harms native workers. Economist George Borjas, a leading proponent of this view, argues that a 10% increase in the labor supply for a specific skill group (e.g., workers without a high school diploma) results in a wage decrease of about 3% for that same group. According to this model, the economic gains from immigration are not evenly distributed; they tend to benefit employers (through lower labor costs) and the immigrants themselves, while native-born workers in direct competition see their wages suppressed [2].

However, this model is often criticized for being too simplistic. Immigrants are not just workers; they are also consumers. They rent apartments, buy food, and use services, which increases overall economic demand. This increased demand leads to business expansion and the creation of new jobs, which in turn increases the demand for labor, helping to offset the initial wage pressure from the larger labor supply [1].

### Factors That Mitigate Wage Effects

Several key factors determine the ultimate impact of immigration on wages:

1.  **Skill Complementarity:** Immigrants and native-born workers are often not perfect substitutes for one another. Instead, they frequently have complementary skills that can boost productivity. For example, an influx of low-skilled construction laborers allows high-skilled architects, engineers, and foremen to become more productive, potentially increasing their wages and expanding construction activity overall. In these cases, immigrants fill labor gaps rather than directly competing for the same jobs as most native workers [1]. High-skilled immigration, in particular, is often associated with innovation and wage growth for native workers [3].

2.  **Long-Term Economic Adjustments:** The immediate, short-term impact of immigration may differ from the long-term effects. In the long run, the economy adjusts to a larger workforce. Businesses may invest in more capital (e.g., new machinery, factories) to equip the new workers, which raises productivity and, consequently, wages. The presence of a larger labor pool can also spur the creation of new businesses that would not have been viable otherwise [1]. A landmark 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) found that over a period of 10 years or more, the long-term wage effects of immigration on native-born workers are very small [3].

3.  **Impact on Specific Groups vs. The Average:** A crucial point of distinction is whether one is looking at the average worker or specific subgroups. Most research concludes that the impact on the *average* native-born worker's wages is minimal and may even be slightly positive [1, 3]. However, the negative effects are more concentrated among those who are most similar to the incoming immigrants. The groups most likely to experience negative wage pressure are:
    *   **Previous Immigrants:** Newly arriving immigrants are most likely to compete directly with immigrants who arrived in earlier waves [3].
    *   **Native-Born Workers with Low Education:** Native-born high school dropouts are the group most likely to be in direct competition with low-skilled immigrants, and thus they may experience modest wage declines [1, 3].

In conclusion, there is no simple "yes" or "no" answer. While immigration can exert downward pressure on the wages of a small segment of the native-born population that is in direct competition for jobs, the effect on the average native-born worker is negligible or slightly positive. The broader economic contributions of immigrants as consumers, entrepreneurs, and holders of complementary skills tend to create economic growth that mitigates negative wage impacts in the long run [1, 3].

1.  **UC Davis Migration News** - This source argues that the simple supply-and-demand model of immigration's effect on wages is misleading. The author, Giovanni Peri, asserts that immigrants are also consumers and that they often have skills that complement, rather than substitute for, native-born workers. The overall conclusion is that most economic studies find immigration has a small positive effect on the average wages of native-born workers, with the most significant (though still small) negative effects felt by native-born high school dropouts.

2.  ***We Wanted Workers*** **(Chapter 9)** - The author, George J. Borjas, presents a standard economic model showing that immigration increases the size of the economy but also redistributes wealth. His research concludes that immigration does drive down the wages of native-born workers who are in direct competition with immigrants. He quantifies this effect, stating that a 10% increase in the labor supply of a particular skill group leads to a wage reduction of about 3% for workers in that group.

3.  ***The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration*** **(National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine)** - This comprehensive report synthesizes the body of research on immigration's economic impact. It finds that over the long term (10+ years), the impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers is minimal. It confirms that the group most negatively affected is prior immigrants who compete with new arrivals. It also notes a modest negative impact on native-born workers without a high school diploma, while finding that high-skilled immigration can have a positive effect on wages and productivity for some native-born workers.
