The effect of immigration on the wages of native-born workers is a central and complex question in economics, with research providing nuanced and sometimes conflicting answers. The consensus among economists is that immigration's impact is not uniform; it varies significantly based on the skill levels of both the immigrant and native populations, the local economic conditions, and the time frame being examined. While some workers, particularly those with low education levels who directly compete with low-skilled immigrants, may experience modest wage declines, the overall effect on the wages of most native-born workers is generally found to be small and can even be positive in the long run.

### The Argument for Negative Wage Effects

The most straightforward economic argument suggests that a large increase in the supply of labor, all else being equal, will lead to a decrease in its priceâ€”that is, lower wages. This effect is expected to be most pronounced for native-born workers who are easily substitutable for new immigrant workers.

*   Economist George Borjas, a leading proponent of this view, argues that immigration creates an "immigration surplus" by increasing the overall size of the economy, but that this surplus comes with a significant redistribution of wealth. The influx of labor drives down wages for competing native workers, while the owners of capital (business owners) benefit from lower labor costs and higher profits [2]. Borjas estimates that for every 10 percent increase in the labor supply from immigration, the wages of competing native-born workers fall by roughly 3 percent. He contends that many studies that find small effects are flawed because they fail to account for native workers moving out of areas with high immigration, which spreads the wage impact across the entire country [2].
*   Oren Cass, writing for the Institute for Family Studies and Public Policy, builds on this argument, framing the combination of mass immigration and trade policy as a deliberate choice that "sold out" American workers, especially those without a college degree. He argues that by prioritizing lower consumer prices and higher corporate profits through an expanded low-wage labor supply, policymakers have actively suppressed wages for the most vulnerable segment of the native-born workforce [3].
*   Even sources that find a smaller overall impact acknowledge this competitive effect. A review of Gordon Hanson's book *Who Wins, Who Loses?* notes that the group most negatively affected by low-skilled immigration is native-born high school dropouts, who experience wage and employment declines due to direct competition [1].

### The Argument for Minimal or Positive Wage Effects

Conversely, a large body of economic research finds that the negative wage effects of immigration are minimal for most native workers and can be positive for many. This view emphasizes that immigrants are not just workers; they are also consumers, entrepreneurs, and sources of complementary skills.

*   **Complementarity vs. Substitution:** Immigrants often possess skills that complement those of the native workforce rather than substitute for them. For example, an influx of high-skilled immigrant engineers can create jobs for American technicians and managers. Similarly, low-skilled immigrants may take physically demanding jobs that native workers are less willing to do, allowing natives to move into better-paying roles that require more communication or specialized skills [1, 4]. A landmark 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) concluded that the long-run impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers is generally small and can be slightly positive [4].
*   **Economic Growth and Demand:** Immigrants spend their wages on goods and services, which increases local demand and can lead to job creation. They also have higher rates of entrepreneurship than the native-born population, starting businesses that employ both immigrant and native workers [1, 4]. This added economic activity helps to absorb the increased labor supply, mitigating downward pressure on wages.
*   **Empirical Evidence:** Classic studies, such as David Card's analysis of the 1980 Mariel Boatlift, provide evidence against a simple supply-demand model. Despite a sudden 7% increase in Miami's labor force from an influx of low-skilled Cuban workers, Card found no discernible negative impact on the wages or unemployment rates of Miami's existing low-skilled workers [5]. While this study's conclusions have been debated, it represents a key piece of evidence that local economies can adapt to immigration in ways that do not harm native workers.

In conclusion, the claim that immigration uniformly drives down wages is not supported by the majority of economic research. The evidence points to a more complex reality: there can be a modest, negative wage impact on the small fraction of the native-born workforce that is in direct competition with new immigrants, particularly high school dropouts [1, 4]. However, for the vast majority of native-born workers, the long-term wage effects of immigration are found to be close to zero or even slightly positive, as immigrants' contributions as consumers, entrepreneurs, and holders of complementary skills help grow the overall economy [1, 4].

    *   This article reviews Gordon Hanson's work, which expresses a nuanced view. It argues that while the overall economic pie grows due to immigration, there are distributional consequences. It finds that low-skilled immigration does negatively impact the wages of the small group of native-born high school dropouts, but the net effect on the wages of most native-born workers is very small.

    *   This comprehensive report synthesizes the body of academic research. It concludes that the long-run impact of immigration on the wages and employment of native-born workers is small. It finds that the group most negatively affected by new immigration is prior immigrants, while the effect on native wages is minimal overall and can be slightly positive due to skill complementarity and economic growth.
