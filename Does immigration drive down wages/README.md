# ü§ñ Claude's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

The relationship between immigration and wages is complex and varies significantly depending on the time frame, skill levels of workers, and economic conditions. Research shows mixed effects, with some evidence of both wage depression and wage increases in different contexts.

## Short-term vs. Long-term Effects

In the short term, immigration can create downward pressure on wages, particularly for workers without high school diplomas and in certain sectors. However, this effect tends to diminish over time as the economy adjusts [1]. The immediate impact occurs when increased labor supply in specific job categories creates more competition for available positions.

## Skill-Level Considerations

The wage effects of immigration differ substantially based on education and skill levels. Native-born workers without high school diplomas experience the most significant wage competition from immigrants, as they often compete for similar jobs [1]. In contrast, highly skilled immigrants may actually complement rather than substitute for native workers, potentially leading to wage increases in some sectors.

## Economic Adaptation and Complementarity

Over longer periods, the economy tends to adapt to immigration through several mechanisms. Immigrants often take jobs that complement rather than directly compete with native workers, create new businesses that generate employment, and contribute to economic growth that can raise wages overall [2]. Additionally, immigration can help fill labor shortages in specific industries, which may actually support wage levels.

## Sector-Specific Impacts

The wage effects vary considerably by industry. In sectors with high concentrations of immigrant workers, such as agriculture, construction, and certain service industries, there may be more pronounced downward pressure on wages. However, in other sectors, immigrant workers may fill essential roles that support overall economic productivity.

## Geographic and Temporal Variations

The impact of immigration on wages also depends on local economic conditions, the pace of immigration, and the ability of local labor markets to adjust. Areas with strong economic growth may absorb immigrant workers more easily without significant wage depression, while regions with economic challenges may experience more pronounced effects.

## Research Consensus

While individual studies show varying results, the broader research consensus suggests that immigration's impact on wages is generally modest and varies significantly by context. The most consistent finding is that any negative wage effects are typically concentrated among workers with the lowest levels of education and tend to be temporary as markets adjust [1][2].

Immigration does **not appear to broadly depress wages** for native-born workers as a whole. A large body of economic research finds that the overall impact of immigration on average wages is **small to negligible** ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=provide%20little%20supporting%20evidence%20to,been%20insulated%20by%20differences%20in)) ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=Several%20studies%20have%20examined%20whether,either%20small%20or%20no%20effects)). In fact, some studies even suggest **slight positive effects** on native wages, since immigrants not only add to labor supply but also **increase demand** for goods and services (creating new jobs and business opportunities) ([www.epi.org](https://www.epi.org/publication/bp255/#:~:text=In%20the%20ongoing%20debate%20on,services%2C%20which%20creates%20more%20jobs)). In other words, as the workforce expands through immigration, the economy tends to adjust in ways that **offset simple wage competition** ‚Äì for example, by stimulating investment or prompting natives to specialize in complementary tasks ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=More%20likely%2C%20as%20evidenced%20by,production%20tasks%2C%20which%20complement%20the)). 

However, **immigration‚Äôs effects can differ across worker groups**. Research shows that any wage declines from immigration are usually concentrated among workers who **directly compete** with new immigrants.  For instance, detailed analyses by the U.S. National Academies and others have found that **previous immigrants** (who have skill profiles similar to new arrivals) and some **lower-educated native-born workers** may experience *modest* wage reductions due to immigration ([nap.nationalacademies.org](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/23550/chapter/2#:~:text=of%20more%20than%2010%20years%2C,shortly%2C%20suggest%20the%20possibility%20of)). These effects are generally small ‚Äì often on the order of a few percentage points ‚Äì and are **not observed for most other workers**. A U.K. government review similarly concluded that immigration had **‚Äúlittle or no‚Äù overall impact on wages**, with **minor negative effects** mainly for lower-education workers and **positive wage effects** for higher-skilled groups ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=2018%20and%20drew%20three%20conclusions,a%20negative)). At the same time, immigration can **boost wages for certain natives** by filling labor shortages and enhancing productivity. High-skilled native workers, for example, may earn more when lower-skilled immigrants expand the workforce in ways that increase the natives‚Äô productivity (such as enabling specialization or business growth) ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=2018%20and%20drew%20three%20conclusions,a%20negative)) ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=Most%20studies%20that%20explicitly%20consider,offset%20competition%20effects%2C%20producing%20the)). 

It‚Äôs worth noting that **not all economists agree** on the exact size of immigration‚Äôs impact. Some researchers have reported larger wage downturns for specific groups, especially in earlier decades. Notably, economist **George Borjas** estimated that the influx of immigrant labor from 1980‚Äì2000 significantly **reduced wages for U.S. high-school dropouts** (a group of workers in direct competition with many immigrants) by roughly **5‚Äì7%** ([prospect.org](https://prospect.org/economy/immigrants-make-everyone-except-high-school-dropouts-better-off/#:~:text=in%20wages,is%20a%20bit%20of%20slight)). This finding implies a measurable downside for the least-educated natives, and it is frequently cited by those arguing that immigration *can* drive down wages. **Other experts, however, dispute these sizable effects** and point out limitations in those studies‚Äô methods. When economists look at real-world ‚Äúnatural experiments‚Äù of sudden immigration surges, they often find **minimal wage impact**. A famous example is David Card‚Äôs study of the **Mariel Boatlift** (Miami, 1980), where a sudden 7% increase in Miami‚Äôs labor force had **no significant effect** on native Miamians‚Äô wages or unemployment rates ‚Äì even among low-skilled workers ([flaglerlive.com](https://flaglerlive.com/david-card-immigration-wages/#:~:text=Card%20found%20a%20%E2%80%9Cnull%E2%80%9D%20effect,at%20odds%20with%20a%20lot)). Findings like Card‚Äôs bolster the view that **immigration generally does not depress wages** for the average native worker, because labor markets adjust via new jobs, relocation, and other economic responses ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=depress%20wages%20by%20competing%20with,Such%20studies%20show%20that)) ([www.cato.org](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2017/does-immigration-reduce-wages#:~:text=lead%20to%20smaller%2C%20negative%20elasticity,Dustmann)). 

**In summary, most economic evidence indicates that immigration has **not caused a broad decline in wages** for native-born workers. Overall wage effects tend to be very small, near zero on average, once the economy adjusts ([nap.nationalacademies.org](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/23550/chapter/2#:~:text=of%20more%20than%2010%20years%2C,shortly%2C%20suggest%20the%20possibility%20of)) ([www.epi.org](https://www.epi.org/publication/bp255/#:~:text=In%20the%20ongoing%20debate%20on,services%2C%20which%20creates%20more%20jobs)). **Modest negative impacts** can occur for *some* workers ‚Äì particularly prior immigrants or those with the least education ‚Äì who directly compete with new immigrant labor ([nap.nationalacademies.org](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/23550/chapter/2#:~:text=range%2C%20indicating%20a%20revised%20and,well%20as%20at%20the%20aggregate)). Even in these cases, the wage reductions are generally limited (a few percent) rather than dramatic. Other workers often see **neutral or positive effects**, as immigrants contribute complementary skills and boost aggregate demand ([www.epi.org](https://www.epi.org/publication/bp255/#:~:text=In%20the%20ongoing%20debate%20on,services%2C%20which%20creates%20more%20jobs)) ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=2018%20and%20drew%20three%20conclusions,a%20negative)). The consensus among experts is that while immigration *may* exert slight downward pressure in specific low-skill labor markets, it does **not overall ‚Äúdrive down‚Äù wages**, and it can bring longer-term economic benefits that **raise productivity and wages** economy-wide ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=provide%20little%20supporting%20evidence%20to,been%20insulated%20by%20differences%20in)) ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=Most%20studies%20that%20explicitly%20consider,offset%20competition%20effects%2C%20producing%20the)).

# ü§ñ Gemini's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

The question of whether immigration drives down wages is a central topic in economics, with research showing that the effects are nuanced and vary significantly across different segments of the population and time frames. While the simplest economic models suggest that an increase in labor supply would lower wages, the reality is more complex [1, 2]. Overall, most studies find that immigration has a small or negligible impact on the average wages of native-born workers, but it can have a more pronounced negative effect on specific groups, particularly previous immigrants and native-born workers with low levels of education [1, 3].

### The Core Economic Arguments

A basic supply and demand model suggests that when the supply of labor increases due to immigration, the price of that labor‚Äîwages‚Äîshould fall, assuming all other factors remain constant. This is the foundation of the argument that immigration harms native workers. Economist George Borjas, a leading proponent of this view, argues that a 10% increase in the labor supply for a specific skill group (e.g., workers without a high school diploma) results in a wage decrease of about 3% for that same group. According to this model, the economic gains from immigration are not evenly distributed; they tend to benefit employers (through lower labor costs) and the immigrants themselves, while native-born workers in direct competition see their wages suppressed [2].

However, this model is often criticized for being too simplistic. Immigrants are not just workers; they are also consumers. They rent apartments, buy food, and use services, which increases overall economic demand. This increased demand leads to business expansion and the creation of new jobs, which in turn increases the demand for labor, helping to offset the initial wage pressure from the larger labor supply [1].

### Factors That Mitigate Wage Effects

Several key factors determine the ultimate impact of immigration on wages:

1.  **Skill Complementarity:** Immigrants and native-born workers are often not perfect substitutes for one another. Instead, they frequently have complementary skills that can boost productivity. For example, an influx of low-skilled construction laborers allows high-skilled architects, engineers, and foremen to become more productive, potentially increasing their wages and expanding construction activity overall. In these cases, immigrants fill labor gaps rather than directly competing for the same jobs as most native workers [1]. High-skilled immigration, in particular, is often associated with innovation and wage growth for native workers [3].

2.  **Long-Term Economic Adjustments:** The immediate, short-term impact of immigration may differ from the long-term effects. In the long run, the economy adjusts to a larger workforce. Businesses may invest in more capital (e.g., new machinery, factories) to equip the new workers, which raises productivity and, consequently, wages. The presence of a larger labor pool can also spur the creation of new businesses that would not have been viable otherwise [1]. A landmark 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) found that over a period of 10 years or more, the long-term wage effects of immigration on native-born workers are very small [3].

3.  **Impact on Specific Groups vs. The Average:** A crucial point of distinction is whether one is looking at the average worker or specific subgroups. Most research concludes that the impact on the *average* native-born worker's wages is minimal and may even be slightly positive [1, 3]. However, the negative effects are more concentrated among those who are most similar to the incoming immigrants. The groups most likely to experience negative wage pressure are:
    *   **Previous Immigrants:** Newly arriving immigrants are most likely to compete directly with immigrants who arrived in earlier waves [3].
    *   **Native-Born Workers with Low Education:** Native-born high school dropouts are the group most likely to be in direct competition with low-skilled immigrants, and thus they may experience modest wage declines [1, 3].

In conclusion, there is no simple "yes" or "no" answer. While immigration can exert downward pressure on the wages of a small segment of the native-born population that is in direct competition for jobs, the effect on the average native-born worker is negligible or slightly positive. The broader economic contributions of immigrants as consumers, entrepreneurs, and holders of complementary skills tend to create economic growth that mitigates negative wage impacts in the long run [1, 3].

# ü§ñ Grok's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

The impact of immigration on wages is a highly debated topic in economics, with research yielding mixed results depending on factors such as the skill level of immigrants, the local labor market, the time frame considered, and the methodology used. Overall, while some studies suggest that immigration can exert downward pressure on wages for certain groups of native workers‚Äîparticularly low-skilled or less-educated ones‚Äîother research finds minimal or even positive effects on average wages. These effects are often short-term and localized, and broader economic benefits like increased productivity and consumer demand can offset wage pressures over time [1][2]. Below, I'll outline the key evidence, drawing from empirical studies and economic analyses.

### Evidence Suggesting Immigration Drives Down Wages
Some economists argue that an influx of immigrants, especially those with similar skills to native workers, increases labor supply and thus competition, leading to lower wages for natives in affected sectors. For instance, research by George Borjas, a prominent labor economist, examines the U.S. labor market and concludes that immigration has reduced wages for low-skilled native workers. In his analysis of data from 1960 to 2010, Borjas estimates that immigration lowered the wages of high school dropouts (a group often competing directly with low-skilled immigrants) by about 3-5% over the long term. He emphasizes that these effects are more pronounced in the short run and for workers without college degrees, as immigrants tend to cluster in low-wage jobs like agriculture, construction, and services [2]. This view is supported by studies on specific industries; for example, in U.S. agriculture, where many immigrants work as farm laborers, increased immigration has been linked to stagnant or declining real wages for native farmworkers, partly due to the seasonal and low-skill nature of the work [1].

Additional research reinforces this perspective. A 2017 study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine reviewed decades of data and found that immigration has a small negative impact on the wages of prior immigrants and low-skilled natives, estimating a 1-2% wage reduction for every 10% increase in the labor force due to immigration [3]. This effect is often most visible in local markets with sudden immigrant inflows, such as during economic booms or refugee crises.

### Evidence Suggesting Immigration Does Not Significantly Drive Down Wages
Conversely, many studies find that immigration has little to no negative effect on native wages overall, and it may even boost them in some cases. Economists like David Card have challenged the wage-depression narrative through natural experiments. Card's famous 1990 study on the Mariel Boatlift‚Äîa sudden influx of 125,000 Cuban immigrants to Miami in 1980‚Äîshowed no significant wage decline for low-skilled natives in the area compared to control cities. Instead, the local economy absorbed the immigrants without harming native employment or pay, possibly due to increased demand for goods and services [4].

This perspective is echoed in broader analyses. A 2015 meta-analysis by economists from the University of California, Davis, and others reviewed over 20 studies and concluded that immigration's impact on wages is generally small and short-lived, often dissipating as economies adjust through business expansion and skill upgrading among natives [1]. For high-skilled immigration, effects can be positive: immigrants in tech and STEM fields, for example, contribute to innovation and productivity growth, which raises overall wages. A Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report from 2020 estimated that increased immigration could boost U.S. GDP and per capita income, with minimal long-term wage suppression for most workers [5].

Factors influencing these outcomes include:
- **Skill complementarity**: High-skilled immigrants often complement rather than compete with natives, creating jobs and raising wages [2][4].
- **Geographic and temporal scope**: Wage effects are more likely in isolated, short-term scenarios but fade nationally over time [1][3].
- **Economic context**: During recessions, competition may intensify, but in growing economies, immigration stimulates demand [5].

### Nuanced Conclusions and Policy Implications
The consensus among economists, as reflected in surveys like those from the IGM Chicago Booth panel, is that immigration does not substantially harm average native wages in the long run, though it may redistribute income by pressuring low-skilled workers while benefiting employers and high-skilled natives [6]. Disagreements often stem from methodological differences, such as whether studies account for immigrants' assimilation or natives' mobility. For accurate policy, experts recommend focusing on integration programs, education, and targeted support for affected workers rather than broad restrictions on immigration.

In summary, immigration can drive down wages for specific subgroups in certain contexts, but evidence suggests it does not broadly suppress wages across the economy. The net effect depends on various factors, and most research points to overall economic gains.

# ü§ñ Claude's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

The relationship between immigration and wages is complex and depends on numerous factors including the skill level of immigrants, the time frame examined, and the specific labor market conditions. Economic research shows mixed results, with effects varying significantly across different contexts.

## Short-term vs. Long-term Effects

In the short term, immigration can create downward pressure on wages in specific sectors where immigrants concentrate, particularly for workers with similar skill levels [1]. However, most economists argue that these effects are typically small and temporary. Long-term effects tend to be more positive as the economy adjusts through job creation, increased demand for goods and services, and complementary labor relationships [2].

## Skill-based Differences

The impact varies significantly based on skill levels:

**Low-skilled workers**: Some studies find modest negative wage effects for native workers without high school diplomas, with estimates ranging from 0% to 5% wage depression [3]. However, these effects are often concentrated in specific industries and geographic areas with high immigrant concentrations.

**High-skilled workers**: Immigration of highly educated workers generally has positive or neutral effects on native wages. High-skilled immigrants often create jobs through entrepreneurship and innovation, leading to wage increases for complementary workers [4].

## Geographic and Industry Variations

Immigration effects are highly localized. Areas with sudden, large influxes of immigrants may experience temporary wage depression, while regions with gradual integration see minimal negative effects [5]. Industries with high immigrant participation, such as agriculture, construction, and hospitality, may experience different wage dynamics than sectors with lower immigrant representation.

## Complementary vs. Substitutable Labor

When immigrants perform jobs that complement rather than directly compete with native workers, wages often increase. For example, immigrants may take jobs that enable native workers to move into higher-skilled, better-paying positions [6]. This "task specialization" can lead to overall wage growth.

## Economic Consensus

The majority of economists surveyed believe that immigration has an overall positive effect on the economy, including wage growth over the long term [7]. The National Academy of Sciences concluded that immigration has had a positive impact on long-term economic growth, though with some negative effects on wages and employment for workers without high school diplomas [8].

## Policy Implications

The wage effects of immigration are influenced by labor market policies, minimum wage laws, and the legal status of immigrants. Undocumented workers may depress wages more than legal immigrants due to their vulnerability to exploitation and inability to report labor violations [9].

# ü§ñ ChatGPT's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

Immigration‚Äôs impact on wages has been studied extensively, and most economic research finds that immigration does **not** significantly drive down overall wages for native-born workers[^1][^2]. In other words, the average effect of immigration on wages tends to be **small to negligible**. Over the past few decades, many studies in various countries (including the US and UK) have found **little to no decrease in average wages** as a result of increased immigration ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=Politicians%2C%20the%20media%2C%20and%20the,native%20workers%20as%20immigration%20rises)) ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=,who%20are%20migrants%20themselves%20More%E2%80%A6)). This is partly because the economy adjusts in response to new workers: immigrants participate as consumers and entrepreneurs, which **expands demand for goods and services** and can create new jobs. Employers respond to a larger labor supply by investing in new capital, adopting new technologies, or shifting native workers into roles that complement immigrant labor (such as jobs requiring language proficiency or customer interaction) ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=The%20recent%20empirical%20literature%20emphasizes,wages%20of%20native%20workers%2C%20even)) ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=economies%20respond%20to%20immigrant%20inflows,much%20in%20response%20to%20immigration)). These adjustments mean that a greater supply of workers doesn‚Äôt necessarily translate into lower pay ‚Äì instead, the market often **absorbs immigrant labor without cutting overall wages** ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=The%20recent%20empirical%20literature%20emphasizes,wages%20of%20native%20workers%2C%20even)) ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=economies%20respond%20to%20immigrant%20inflows,much%20in%20response%20to%20immigration)). Indeed, comprehensive analyses have concluded that immigration has **‚Äúlittle to no‚Äù negative effect on the wages** or employment levels of native-born populations as a whole ([www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/news/nas-report-finds-immigration-win-us-economy#:~:text=U.S.,did%20not%20graduate%20high%20school)). Some economists even find a slight *positive* impact on average wages in the long run, since immigrants can boost productivity and innovation ‚Äì especially when they bring skills that complement the native workforce ([wol.iza.org](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long#:~:text=Author%27s%20main%20message)). In summary, **immigration is not a major factor driving broad wage declines** in the economy[^2][^3].

However, immigration‚Äôs effect on wages **is not uniform across all workers**, and modest impacts can occur for specific groups. Research often finds that **lower‚Äêskill or lower-wage workers** experience the most competition from incoming immigrants, while higher-skill workers may actually benefit. For example, studies in the UK and US have detected *slight* wage decreases at the bottom of the wage distribution alongside *slight* wage increases at the top, though these effects are **very small** in magnitude ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=Low,but%20the%20effects%20are%20small)) ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%202022%20study,findings%20%2015%20from%20other)). One UK government review concluded that if any wage impacts exist, they are concentrated among certain groups ‚Äì **a minor negative effect for native workers with lower education, and a small positive effect for higher-educated workers** ‚Äì with **little or no impact on the average wage overall** ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20the%20Migration%20Advisory,or%20unemployment%2C%20specifically%20during%20downturns)) ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=Similarly%2C%20the%20MAC%20review%20concluded,others%20found%20positive%20average%20effects)). Crucially, even where wage depression is observed for lower-paid natives, studies indicate the effect is **modest**. For instance, one detailed analysis found that a 1 percentage-point increase in the share of immigrants in low-wage service jobs **reduced wages in those jobs by only about 0.2%** (i.e. a **0.2% dip**)[^4] ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%202022%20study,findings%20%2015%20from%20other)) ‚Äì a barely perceptible change. Moreover, **immigrants tend to compete most directly with other immigrants** (or with very similar skill workers), rather than with native-born workers who often have different skills or occupations ([migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/#:~:text=workers%20who%20are%20migrants%20themselves)) ([www.epi.org](https://www.epi.org/publication/bp255/#:~:text=A%20key%20result%20from%20this,new%20immigrants%E2%80%94that%20is%2C%20earlier%20immigrants)). Empirical data support this substitution pattern: one U.S. study found that from 1994‚Äì2007, the influx of new immigrants **slightly *raised*** wages for U.S.-born workers (by about +0.4%), while **lowering wages for earlier immigrants by roughly 4‚Äì5%** ([www.epi.org](https://www.epi.org/publication/bp255/#:~:text=A%20key%20result%20from%20this,new%20immigrants%E2%80%94that%20is%2C%20earlier%20immigrants)). In other words, any wage pressures from new immigration were absorbed largely by **immigrant workers already in the country**, not by native workers ([www.epi.org](https://www.epi.org/publication/bp255/#:~:text=A%20key%20result%20from%20this,new%20immigrants%E2%80%94that%20is%2C%20earlier%20immigrants)). Similarly, the U.S. National Academies panel noted that recent immigrants may modestly depress wages of **prior** immigrants or very low-educated natives (such as high school dropouts), but that **other native workers are mostly unaffected** ([www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/news/nas-report-finds-immigration-win-us-economy#:~:text=U.S.,did%20not%20graduate%20high%20school)). Overall, immigration‚Äôs wage effects appear to be **small and localized to certain labor market segments**, rather than a sweeping depression of wages across the board[^2][^3].

It‚Äôs important to acknowledge that **not all economists agree entirely**, and some research does find more noticeable wage declines under specific conditions. A few studies using different methods or focusing on particular labor segments suggest that immigration can exert **downward pressure on wages** for certain groups of native workers ‚Äì especially those with the least education who may directly compete for similar low-skill jobs. For example, Harvard economist George Borjas has argued that an influx of immigrants can significantly reduce wages for some low-education groups, estimating that a 10% increase in the immigrant workforce could lower wages for comparable native workers by around **3‚Äì4%** ([www.cato.org](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2017/does-immigration-reduce-wages#:~:text=U,Borjas%202003%20%2C%20%204)). Likewise, a study by the Center for Immigration Studies (an organization favoring reduced immigration) estimated that immigration in the US labor market contributed to a roughly **5% drop in average wages** of native-born workers over time, with much larger impacts (on the order of **10‚Äì12% lower wages**) for natives employed in predominantly low-skill occupations ([cis.org](https://cis.org/Report/Wages-Immigration#:~:text=The%20regression%20equations%20indicate%20that,skilled)) ([cis.org](https://cis.org/Report/Wages-Immigration#:~:text=,the%20immigrant%20composition%20of%20their)). These findings represent the higher end of estimated impacts; they suggest that *in theory* increasing the labor supply through immigration *could* push wages down in sectors where immigrants and natives are close substitutes. However, such outcomes are **heavily debated**. Other economists point out that these larger negative estimates often depend on specific modeling assumptions (for instance, treating all low-education workers as interchangeable) and may not account for the dynamic ways labor markets adjust[^5]. Indeed, the most restrictive estimates (like Borjas‚Äôs) contrast with many empirical studies that observe **little to no wage decline** in actual cities or industries that received immigrant surges ([cis.org](https://cis.org/Report/Immigration-and-Wages#:~:text=Does%20immigration%20lower%20the%20wages,affects%20wages%20in%20one%20city)) ([cis.org](https://cis.org/Report/Immigration-and-Wages#:~:text=The%20policy%20stakes%20are%20high%2C,wage%20trend%20in%20control%20cities)). In cases like the famous *Mariel boatlift* (when a sudden wave of Cuban refugees arrived in Miami in 1980), initial research found **no significant drop** in local wages, while a later re-analysis claimed a large wage drop for high-school dropouts ‚Äì a claim subsequently challenged as a statistical artifact ([cis.org](https://cis.org/Report/Immigration-and-Wages#:~:text=The%20policy%20stakes%20are%20high%2C,wage%20trend%20in%20control%20cities)) ([cis.org](https://cis.org/Report/Immigration-and-Wages#:~:text=It%20did%20not%20take%20long,9)). This back-and-forth illustrates that results can vary with methodology, but **the bulk of evidence leans toward a modest impact**. Major literature surveys find that the *average wage elasticity* with respect to immigration is around **‚Äì0.2** (meaning a 10% increase in immigrant workers might lower native wages by only ~2%) ([www.cato.org](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2017/does-immigration-reduce-wages#:~:text=wage%20elasticity%20of%20immigration%E2%80%94the%20percentage,a%20greater%20wage%20elasticity%20of)). Even the more pessimistic estimates (elasticities of ‚Äì0.3 or ‚Äì0.4) imply relatively small wage adjustments spread over many years ([www.cato.org](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2017/does-immigration-reduce-wages#:~:text=U,Borjas%202003%20%2C%20%204)). 

**In summary, most economic research finds that immigration does not dramatically drive down wages.** The consensus is that **overall wage levels are barely affected** by immigration, because any added labor supply is offset by adjustments in the economy (like increased demand, investment, and specialization). While **certain workers who directly compete with immigrants in the labor market (such as earlier immigrants or those without a diploma)** may experience **slight wage declines**, those effects tend to be **minor in scale** (a few percent or less)[^4] and are often temporary as markets adapt. Other workers may even see small wage gains due to complementary skills and a larger economy. In the long run, immigration can contribute to economic growth, and there is **little evidence** that it is a major drag on native workers‚Äô pay ([www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/news/nas-report-finds-immigration-win-us-economy#:~:text=U.S.,did%20not%20graduate%20high%20school)). Instead of being a primary force pushing wages down, immigration appears to be just one of many factors in a complex labor market ‚Äì with **its overall wage impact being relatively muted** and concentrated in specific niches rather than across the entire workforce[^1][^2][^3].

[^5]: For example, some models that find bigger negative impacts assume native and immigrant workers are perfect substitutes within broad skill categories. If instead immigrants have slightly different skills or allow natives to specialize in other tasks, the negative impact would be dampened. This debate over modeling assumptions is a key reason why research results vary.


# ü§ñ Gemini's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

The question of whether immigration drives down wages is one of the most debated topics in economics and public policy. The answer is not a simple yes or no; rather, it is highly nuanced. The consensus among most economists is that while immigration can place some downward pressure on the wages of a small, specific group of native-born workers in the short term, its overall long-term effect on average native-born wages is minimal and may even be slightly positive [3, 4].

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the factors at play.

### 1. The Basic Economic Theory: Supply and Demand

The most straightforward argument for why immigration might lower wages is based on the simple model of supply and demand. In this model:
*   **Labor is a commodity.**
*   **Wages are the price of labor.**
*   **An influx of immigrants increases the supply of labor.**

All else being equal, an increase in the supply of any commodity leads to a decrease in its price. Therefore, a larger pool of workers competing for the same number of jobs should theoretically push wages down. This effect would be most pronounced if immigrant workers are perfect substitutes for native-born workers, meaning they have similar skills and compete for the same jobs [2].

### 2. Complicating Factors: Why the Simple Theory is Incomplete

The real world is far more complex than the basic supply-and-demand model suggests. Several factors complicate the relationship between immigration and wages, often offsetting the downward pressure on wages.

*   **Immigrants are also Consumers:** Immigrants do not just supply labor; they also demand goods and services. They rent apartments, buy food, get haircuts, and purchase cars. This increased demand stimulates economic growth, leading businesses to expand and create more jobs. This new job creation helps absorb the larger labor supply, counteracting the initial downward wage pressure [4].

*   **Complementarity vs. Substitution:** Immigrants and native-born workers are often not perfect substitutes. In many cases, their skills are complementary. This means the skills of one group enhance the productivity and wages of the other. For example:
    *   An influx of low-skilled immigrant construction workers can create more demand for higher-skilled, native-born construction managers, architects, and real estate agents.
    *   A high-skilled immigrant engineer might start a tech company that hires native-born technicians, marketers, and administrative staff.
    In these cases, immigration can directly *raise* the wages of complementary native-born workers [4].

*   **Capital Adjustment:** Economies are dynamic. When the supply of labor increases and becomes cheaper, businesses are incentivized to invest in new capital‚Äîsuch as machinery, technology, and new facilities‚Äîto take advantage of the larger workforce. This expansion of capital increases overall productivity and the demand for labor in the long run, which can restore or even increase wages [3].

*   **Entrepreneurship:** Immigrants have a significantly higher rate of entrepreneurship than native-born citizens. By starting new businesses, they create jobs for both immigrants and natives, contributing to economic dynamism and offsetting any displacement effects [3].

### 3. Empirical Evidence and Key Studies

To move beyond theory, economists have used "natural experiments" to study the real-world effects of immigration. The most famous of these is the **Mariel Boatlift**.

In 1980, Fidel Castro permitted about 125,000 Cubans, mostly low-skilled laborers, to emigrate to the United States. Many settled in Miami, increasing the city‚Äôs labor force by 7% almost overnight.

*   **The Card Study (1990):** Economist David Card studied the impact of this sudden influx on Miami‚Äôs labor market. He compared the wage and unemployment trends in Miami to those in four similar cities (Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, and Tampa). His landmark finding was that the Mariel Boatlift had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of Miami's existing low-skilled workers, including earlier Cuban immigrants [1]. This study provided powerful evidence that an economy can absorb a large influx of labor without significant negative consequences for native workers.

*   **The Borjas Re-Analysis (2017):** Economist George Borjas, a prominent critic of the consensus view, later re-analyzed the Mariel data. By focusing on a very narrow demographic‚Äînative-born male high school dropouts between the ages of 25 and 59‚Äîhe found that this specific group did experience a significant wage decline of 10% to 30% [2].

The debate between the Card and Borjas findings highlights the complexity of the issue. Most economists believe that while Borjas may have identified a real effect on a very small subset of the native population, the broader picture presented by Card and others remains more accurate for the overall economy. The group Borjas studied represents less than 1% of the workforce [1, 2].

### 4. Differentiated Impacts on Different Groups

The impact of immigration is not uniform across the entire population. The consensus from a comprehensive 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) is as follows:

*   **High-Skilled Natives:** This group generally sees a small but clear wage *increase* from immigration due to complementarity. They benefit from the new skills, innovation, and business creation that immigrants bring [3].
*   **Low-Skilled Natives:** The effect on this group is the most debated. The NASEM report concluded that the effect on the wages of native-born workers with low levels of education is, on average, very small. Any negative effects are concentrated on those who did not complete high school [3].
*   **Previous Immigrants:** The group that faces the most significant negative wage pressure from new immigration is often prior immigrants. This is because they are the most likely to be direct substitutes for new arrivals in terms of skills, language, and social networks [3].

### Conclusion

In summary, the claim that immigration drives down wages for the general population is not supported by the bulk of economic research. The evidence points to the following conclusions:

1.  **Overall Impact is Minimal:** For the vast majority of native-born workers, the net effect of immigration on wages is negligible, hovering close to zero.
2.  **Negative Impacts are Concentrated:** The small negative wage effects that do exist are concentrated on a very specific and small subgroup of the population: native-born workers without a high school diploma and, more significantly, recent immigrants who have similar skills to the new arrivals.
3.  **Positive Impacts Exist:** High-skilled native workers often see their wages increase. Furthermore, the economy as a whole benefits from the increased demand, entrepreneurship, and innovation that immigrants provide, which creates jobs and promotes long-term growth.
4.  **The Economy Adapts:** The labor market is not static. It adjusts to immigration through capital investment, shifts in production, and the creation of new businesses, which help absorb the new labor supply over time.

# ü§ñ Grok's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

The question of whether immigration drives down wages is a contentious topic in economics, with research yielding mixed and often nuanced findings. The impact depends on factors such as the skill levels of immigrants and natives, the local labor market, the time frame considered (short-term vs. long-term), and the overall economic context. Broadly, some studies suggest that immigration can exert downward pressure on wages for certain groups, particularly low-skilled native workers, due to increased labor supply. However, other research indicates minimal or even positive effects, as immigrants can complement native workers, boost demand, and contribute to economic growth. Below, I'll outline the key arguments, evidence, and counterpoints, drawing on empirical studies and expert analyses.

### Arguments That Immigration Drives Down Wages
One perspective, often associated with labor economists like George Borjas, posits that immigration increases the supply of workers, particularly in low-skilled sectors, leading to competition that reduces wages for similar native workers. This is grounded in basic supply-and-demand principles: an influx of labor can shift the supply curve rightward, lowering equilibrium wages unless demand adjusts accordingly [1].

- **Empirical Evidence**: Borjas's research, including a 2003 study analyzing U.S. data from 1960‚Äì2000, found that a 10% increase in the labor supply due to immigration reduced wages for competing native workers by 3‚Äì4%, with the strongest effects on high school dropouts (up to 8‚Äì9% wage decline) [1]. This effect is more pronounced in the short term and in localized markets with high immigrant concentrations, such as construction, agriculture, or service industries. A 2017 review by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) corroborated this, estimating that immigration may reduce wages for prior immigrants and low-skilled natives by 1‚Äì6% over a decade, though effects fade over time [2].
  
- **Mechanisms**: Immigrants often fill low-wage jobs, potentially displacing or undercutting natives. For instance, in countries like the UK, post-2004 EU enlargement immigration was linked to slight wage suppression at the lower end of the income distribution [3].

### Arguments That Immigration Does Not Drive Down Wages (or Has Positive Effects)
Counterarguments emphasize that immigration's effects are not uniformly negative and can be neutral or beneficial. Economists like David Card argue that labor markets are dynamic: immigrants create demand for goods and services, start businesses, and complement rather than substitute for native workers. High-skilled immigrants, in particular, can enhance productivity and innovation, leading to wage growth [4].

- **Empirical Evidence**: Card's seminal 1990 study on the Mariel Boatlift‚Äîa sudden influx of 125,000 Cuban immigrants to Miami in 1980‚Äîfound no significant wage decline for low-skilled natives, including Black workers, suggesting rapid labor market absorption [4]. More recent work by Giovanni Peri and colleagues, using U.S. data from 1960‚Äì2006, showed that immigration often raises average wages by 0.6‚Äì1.0% due to skill complementarities; low-skilled immigrants push natives toward higher-skilled jobs, increasing overall efficiency [5]. The NASEM report also noted that over the long term (beyond 10 years), immigration has a small positive effect on native wages, especially for skilled workers [2].

- **Broader Context**: In high-immigration countries like the U.S., overall wage stagnation is more attributable to factors like technological change, globalization, and declining union power than immigration alone [6]. A 2020 Brookings Institution analysis found that immigrants contribute to economic growth, with minimal net wage impacts when accounting for consumer demand and entrepreneurship [6]. Internationally, a 2018 study on European labor markets post-refugee crisis showed short-term wage dips in some sectors but no long-term depression [3].

### Nuances and Key Factors Influencing the Impact
The wage effects of immigration are not one-size-fits-all:
- **Skill Levels**: Low-skilled immigration may pressure wages for similar natives, but high-skilled inflows (e.g., in tech) often boost wages by increasing innovation and firm productivity [5].
- **Time Horizon**: Short-term disruptions can occur, but long-term adjustments (e.g., natives upskilling or businesses expanding) mitigate effects [2].
- **Geography and Policy**: Impacts are localized; in areas with flexible labor markets and integration policies, wages recover faster. For example, Canada's points-based system minimizes negative effects by prioritizing skilled immigrants [6].
- **Overall Economic Benefits**: Even if some wages dip, immigration often increases GDP per capita and tax revenues, potentially funding wage-supporting programs [2].

In summary, while some evidence supports the idea that immigration can drive down wages for specific low-skilled groups in the short term, the preponderance of recent research suggests minimal overall or net positive effects, especially long-term. Policymakers can mitigate downsides through education, training, and labor protections. The debate remains ongoing, with outcomes varying by context.
