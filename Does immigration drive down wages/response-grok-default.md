The question of whether immigration drives down wages is a contentious topic in economics, with research yielding mixed and nuanced findings. The impact depends on factors such as the skill levels of immigrants and natives, the local labor market conditions, the time frame considered (short-term vs. long-term), and the overall economic context. Broadly, some studies suggest that immigration can exert downward pressure on wages for certain groups, particularly low-skilled native workers, while others find minimal or even positive effects on average wages due to economic complementarities, increased demand, and productivity gains. Below, I'll outline the key arguments, evidence, and caveats, drawing on empirical research.

### Arguments That Immigration Drives Down Wages
One perspective, often associated with labor economists like George Borjas, posits that an influx of immigrants increases the supply of labor, which can reduce wages for workers with similar skills, especially in the short term. This view is grounded in basic supply-and-demand principles: more workers competing for jobs can lower the price of labor (wages). For instance, Borjas's research on U.S. immigration from 1980 to 2000 estimated that a 10% increase in the labor supply due to immigration reduced wages for native high school dropouts by about 3-5% [1]. This effect is more pronounced in localized markets or for low-skilled jobs where immigrants often concentrate, such as construction, agriculture, or service industries. Critics of immigration policies sometimes cite this to argue that it harms vulnerable native workers, including minorities and those without college degrees.

Supporting evidence comes from studies examining specific immigration waves. For example, research on European labor markets during the 2000s found that large inflows of low-skilled migrants from Eastern Europe to the UK slightly depressed wages at the bottom of the income distribution [2]. Similarly, a 2016 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) concluded that immigration has a small negative impact on the wages of prior immigrants and low-skilled natives in the short run, though the effects diminish over time [3].

### Arguments That Immigration Does Not Drive Down Wages (or May Even Increase Them)
Conversely, many economists argue that immigration's impact on wages is neutral or positive overall, particularly in the long term. This view emphasizes that immigrants are not perfect substitutes for native workers; they often fill complementary roles, boosting productivity and creating jobs. For example, high-skilled immigrants (e.g., in tech or healthcare) can innovate and expand industries, leading to higher wages for natives [4]. Even low-skilled immigration can stimulate demand for goods and services, as immigrants consume and start businesses, indirectly supporting wage growth.

A landmark study by David Card analyzed the 1980 Mariel Boatlift, where 125,000 Cuban immigrants arrived in Miami, increasing the local labor force by 7%. Card found no significant decline in wages or employment for low-skilled natives, including Black workers, suggesting that labor markets adjust quickly through mechanisms like business expansion or native mobility [5]. More recent meta-analyses, such as one by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), indicate that immigration has little to no average effect on native wages across advanced economies, with any negative impacts limited to specific subgroups and offset by positives elsewhere [6].

Long-term studies reinforce this. Giovanni Peri's research shows that immigration can raise average wages by 0.5-1% for natives over a decade, as immigrants encourage skill specialization and capital investment [4]. The NASEM report also notes that while short-term wage pressures exist, the overall fiscal and economic contributions of immigrants (e.g., through taxes and entrepreneurship) lead to net benefits, including wage gains for most natives [3].

### Nuances and Contextual Factors
The evidence is not black-and-white; effects vary by context:
- **Skill Levels**: Low-skilled immigration tends to affect low-skilled natives more negatively, while high-skilled immigration benefits the economy broadly [1][4].
- **Geography and Scale**: Impacts are stronger in areas with sudden, large inflows (e.g., refugee crises) but dissipate in diverse, dynamic economies like the U.S. [5][6].
- **Time Horizon**: Short-term wage dips often reverse as markets adapt; long-term studies show neutral or positive effects [3].
- **Other Influences**: Immigration's wage effects can be mitigated by policies like minimum wage laws, education investments, or labor protections. Additionally, global factors like trade and automation often have larger wage-suppressing effects than immigration [6].

Critics of anti-immigration stances argue that focusing solely on wages ignores broader benefits, such as GDP growth and innovation. Conversely, proponents of restrictions highlight equity concerns for disadvantaged natives.

In summary, immigration does not uniformly drive down wages; it can have modest negative effects on specific groups in the short term but often leads to neutral or positive outcomes overall. Policymakers should consider targeted supports (e.g., training programs) to address any adverse impacts. This conclusion aligns with a consensus among many economists, as reflected in surveys like the IGM Chicago Booth panel, where most experts agree immigration is beneficial on net [7].
