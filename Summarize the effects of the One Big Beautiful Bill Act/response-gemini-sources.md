# Summarize the effects of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act?

It is not possible to summarize the effects of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" as this bill does not exist. The provided source link is for H.R.1 of the 119th Congress, which is also non-existent legislation [1].

The U.S. Congress operates in two-year sessions. As of 2024, the current session is the 118th Congress. The 119th Congress is not scheduled to convene until January 2025, and no bills have been introduced for that session [2]. The official U.S. legislative website, Congress.gov, confirms that H.R.1 for the 119th Congress has not been found [1].

Because the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is a fictitious title for a bill that has not been introduced in a future session of Congress, there are no legislative text, provisions, or official analyses to describe its potential effects.
