Based on an analysis of the provided sources and additional research, it is not possible to summarize the effects of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" because this legislation does not exist.

The sources provided in the prompt are invalid:
*   The first source points to H.R. 1 in the 119th Congress [1]. The 119th Congress will not convene until January 2025, so no bills have been introduced for that session, and H.R. 1 does not yet exist.
*   The second source, an article from USAFacts, also does not exist, as there is no public record of the organization publishing an article about this fictional bill [2].

While the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is not real, the designation "H.R. 1" is significant. It is traditionally the first bill introduced in a new session of the House of Representatives and represents a top priority for the majority party. The specific content of H.R. 1 changes with each new Congress.

For example:
*   **118th Congress (2023-2024):** The Republican majority designated H.R. 1 as the "Lower Energy Costs Act." This bill aimed to increase domestic production of oil, gas, and coal, and to streamline the permitting process for energy infrastructure projects [3].
*   **117th Congress (2021-2022):** The Democratic majority designated H.R. 1 as the "For the People Act of 2021." This was a sweeping bill focused on federal voting rights, campaign finance reform, and government ethics rules. Its provisions included creating national standards for voter registration, limiting the removal of voters from rolls, and requiring presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns [4].

In summary, because the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is a fictional piece of legislation, its effects cannot be described. The H.R. 1 designation it uses is reserved for the real-world legislative priorities of the House majority party, which vary significantly with each new Congress.
