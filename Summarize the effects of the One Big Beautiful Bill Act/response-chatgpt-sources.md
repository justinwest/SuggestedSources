# Summarize the effects of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act?

The **One Big Beautiful Bill Act** is a sweeping budget reconciliation package (H.R. 1 in the 119th Congress) that combines major tax cuts with broad changes to federal spending and the debt limit ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1#:~:text=This%20bill%20reduces%20taxes%2C%20reduces,programs%20throughout%20the%20federal%20government)).  The legislation – championed by congressional Republicans in 2025 – spans **11 different House committees’ proposals**, addressing policy areas from agriculture and education to energy, health care, defense, and taxes. In general, the Act reflects a hardline conservative fiscal agenda: it **reduces taxes**, makes significant **spending cuts (with a few increases in select areas)**, and **raises the statutory debt ceiling** to accommodate those changes ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1#:~:text=This%20bill%20reduces%20taxes%2C%20reduces,programs%20throughout%20the%20federal%20government)). Supporters like House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington lauded it as an historic achievement – *“the largest tax cuts, security investment, federal energy asset deployment, and spending reduction in the history of the United States”* – meant to advance a full “America First” agenda under President Trump ([budget.house.gov](https://budget.house.gov/press-release/chairman-arrington-in-rules-opening-statement-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-advances-full-america-first-agenda#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20One%20Big%20Beautiful%20Bill,Chairman%20Arrington)). Opponents, however, argue the bill’s **benefits skew toward the wealthy** while **hurting vulnerable groups** and **worsening the national debt** in the long run ([time.com](https://time.com/7288139/big-beautiful-bill-medicare-medicaid-national-debt/#:~:text=evidencing%20party%20allegiance,act%20as%20political%20ammunition%20against)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-us-senate-republicans-face-test-big-beautiful-bill-deadline-looms-2025-06-23/#:~:text=Hardline%20fiscal%20conservatives%20object%20to,Thune%20is%20pushing%20for%20Senate)). Below is a summary of its key effects on taxes, spending, and fiscal policy.

**Tax Cuts and Policy Changes:** The Act’s tax title (crafted by the Ways and Means Committee) makes permanent many of the individual tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which were originally set to expire ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1#:~:text=This%20part%20makes%20permanent%20multiple,Tax%20Cuts%20and%20Jobs%20Act)). For example, it **locks in lower individual income tax rates** (ranging from 10% up to 37%) beyond 2025, preventing those rates from rising as scheduled ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1#:~:text=This%20part%20makes%20permanent%20multiple,Tax%20Cuts%20and%20Jobs%20Act)). It also **extends the larger standard deduction** established in 2017 and continues limits on personal exemptions ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1#:~:text=%28Sec,and%2037)).  The Act **enhances certain tax benefits** for families and businesses: it temporarily boosts the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 to $2,500 per child through 2028 (with the $2,000 base amount made permanent and indexed for inflation thereafter) ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1#:~:text=%28Sec,for%20inflation%20beginning%20in%202029)), and it increases the deduction for pass-through business income from 20% to **23%** to further aid small businesses and “Main Street” entrepreneurs ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1#:~:text=qualifying%20child)). Lawmakers also added some new tax breaks and adjustments. For instance, the final House version raised the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction from $30,000 to $40,000 (for joint filers, half that for separate filers), providing relief to taxpayers in high-tax states ([kpmg.com](https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2025-105.html#:~:text=,the%20Ways%20and%20Means%20Committee)). It tweaked the **alternative minimum tax (AMT)** to slow its inflation adjustment – a change projected to **pull more high-income earners back into the AMT** than under prior law ([kpmg.com](https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2025-105.html#:~:text=deduction%20starts%20to%20phase%20out,income%20earners)). Another provision would **eliminate taxes on certain forms of overtime and tip income**, a populist measure aimed at hourly workers ([time.com](https://time.com/7288139/big-beautiful-bill-medicare-medicaid-national-debt/#:~:text=evidencing%20party%20allegiance,act%20as%20political%20ammunition%20against)). In total, these tax cuts are **highly favorable to businesses and upper-income households** (by making the Trump-era rates and deductions permanent) **while offering modest short-term benefits to middle-class families** (e.g. slightly larger child credits and SALT deductions). **Revenue losses are substantial**: the tax measures, by themselves, **add hundreds of billions of dollars to deficits** over the coming decade ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-us-senate-republicans-face-test-big-beautiful-bill-deadline-looms-2025-06-23/#:~:text=Hardline%20fiscal%20conservatives%20object%20to,Thune%20is%20pushing%20for%20Senate)). Critics note that the **wealthiest Americans stand to gain the most**, and that these cuts **exacerbate inequality** even as they diminish federal revenues available for social programs ([time.com](https://time.com/7288139/big-beautiful-bill-medicare-medicaid-national-debt/#:~:text=disproportionately%20benefiting%20wealthy%20Americans,controlled%20Senate%2C%20lawmakers%20are)).

**Spending Cuts to Domestic Programs:** On the spending side, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act institutes **major cuts or restrictions on a number of federal programs**, particularly in social safety-net and climate-related areas. One prominent change is to the **Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)**: the bill tightens SNAP eligibility by expanding work requirements for “able-bodied adults without dependents.” It **raises the age cutoff for mandatory work** from 55 to **65 years old**, meaning adults up to 64 must work or lose benefits ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20the%20section%20amends%20the,exemptions%20to%20this%20requirement)). It also **narrows exemptions** – for example, only parents with children under 7 years old are exempt (down from under 18 in current law) ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1#:~:text=are%20not%20over%2055%20years,old)) – and severely limits states’ ability to waive these rules in areas of high unemployment ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1#:~:text=%28Sec,a%20sufficient%20number%20of%20jobs)). These stricter provisions would **remove food assistance from many low-income individuals**, with estimates that about **11 million people could lose SNAP benefits** as a result ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40stella_2437/it-aint-pretty-a-christian-s-perspective-of-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-807702f38277#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Center%20on,former%20foster%20youth%20who%2C%20under)). The Act also targets health care entitlements: it includes roughly **$700 billion in cuts to Medicaid** over ten years, achieved through measures like capped federal payments and new cost-sharing requirements for states ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40stella_2437/it-aint-pretty-a-christian-s-perspective-of-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-807702f38277#:~:text=benefiting%20the%20poor%20and%20most,cuts%20to%20other%20nonmilitary%20programs)). Other anti-poverty and public health programs face cuts as well. The bill rescinds funding from prior legislation that was aimed at climate resilience and public health; for instance, it **slashes about 40% of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget** and cuts over $1 billion from the National Cancer Institute ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40stella_2437/it-aint-pretty-a-christian-s-perspective-of-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-807702f38277#:~:text=This%20legislation%20includes%20a%2040,slowing%20the%20review%20process%20for)), moves that **threaten medical research and disease prevention efforts**. It also reduces budgets for federal regulatory agencies and social services – the **Food and Drug Administration sees funding trims** that could slow new drug approvals ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40stella_2437/it-aint-pretty-a-christian-s-perspective-of-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-807702f38277#:~:text=This%20legislation%20includes%20a%2040,slowing%20the%20review%20process%20for)), and federal workforce programs (like the civil service retirement system) are adjusted to save costs ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1#:~:text=TITLE%20IX,GOVERNMENT%20REFORM)). Furthermore, the Act **reverses or cancels many clean energy initiatives** put in place under the previous administration. It **repeals tax credits and funding for renewable energy and climate programs** (described by proponents as ending “green corporate subsidies”), effectively dialing back government support for clean energy in favor of expanding domestic fossil fuel production ([www.americanprogress.org](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/10-egregious-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act/#:~:text=This%20week%2C%20congressional%20Republicans%20passed,overnight%20and%20behind%20closed%20doors)). These domestic cuts and rescissions reflect a prioritization of deficit reduction and conservative policy goals over spending on social, scientific, and environmental programs. *Opponents warn of serious consequences:* poor families losing food and medical coverage, higher costs for seniors and low-income Americans, and setbacks in scientific research and climate resiliency ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40stella_2437/it-aint-pretty-a-christian-s-perspective-of-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-807702f38277#:~:text=benefiting%20the%20poor%20and%20most,cuts%20to%20other%20nonmilitary%20programs)) ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40stella_2437/it-aint-pretty-a-christian-s-perspective-of-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-807702f38277#:~:text=This%20legislation%20includes%20a%2040,slowing%20the%20review%20process%20for)).

**Increases in Defense and Border Security Spending:** In contrast to the domestic cuts, the Act boosts funding in a few areas aligned with conservative priorities. **Defense spending is increased** – the bill provides additional military funding for FY2025 on top of baseline levels ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1#:~:text=TITLE%20II)), directing new resources to the Department of Defense. A significant sum is funneled to border security under the Homeland Security title: the Act allocates money to **U.S. Customs and Border Protection for border barrier construction**, infrastructure, and surveillance along the southern border ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1#:~:text=TITLE%20VI)). This effectively green-lights expansion of the border wall and related security measures. The bill also invests in veterans’ services and law enforcement in certain ways (for example, it preserves VA health benefits while tightening some administrative expenses) and **streamlines energy production leases on federal lands** to encourage oil and gas development (promoted as “energy asset deployment”) ([budget.house.gov](https://budget.house.gov/press-release/chairman-arrington-in-rules-opening-statement-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-advances-full-america-first-agenda#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20One%20Big%20Beautiful%20Bill,Chairman%20Arrington)). These increases are relatively small in budgetary terms compared to the large tax cuts and entitlement reductions, but they signal the Act’s emphasis on **“law and order” and national security goals over domestic welfare**. The trade-off is clear: **more funding for the military and border enforcement is paired with cutbacks in social programs and green investments** ([www.americanprogress.org](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/10-egregious-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act/#:~:text=This%20week%2C%20congressional%20Republicans%20passed,overnight%20and%20behind%20closed%20doors)) ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40stella_2437/it-aint-pretty-a-christian-s-perspective-of-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-807702f38277#:~:text=benefiting%20the%20poor%20and%20most,cuts%20to%20other%20nonmilitary%20programs)).

**Debt Ceiling Hike and Fiscal Impact:** A critical element of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is that it **raises the federal debt limit by \$4 trillion** ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1#:~:text=match%20at%20L2149%20Subtitle%20D,in%20Debt%20Limit)). This increase in the Treasury’s borrowing cap was included to prevent a government default and ensure the U.S. can continue paying its obligations while the bill’s policy changes take effect. By packaging the debt-ceiling hike with spending cuts and tax measures, House Republicans used the budget reconciliation process to pass the entire package with a simple majority vote (bypassing any Senate filibuster) ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1#:~:text=It%20is%20known%20as%20a,restrict%20amendments%20in%20the%20Senate)). **Fiscal analysts project** that, despite the spending reductions, the Act would **significantly increase federal deficits** in coming years due to the extensive tax breaks. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the bill would **add roughly $2.8 trillion to the national debt over the next decade** ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-us-senate-republicans-face-test-big-beautiful-bill-deadline-looms-2025-06-23/#:~:text=Hardline%20fiscal%20conservatives%20object%20to,Thune%20is%20pushing%20for%20Senate)). (By comparison, some House conservatives argued the cuts did not go far enough – they wanted deeper reductions to offset the tax giveaways – while Democrats denounced the bill for *ballooning* the debt and risking funding shortfalls for essential programs ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-us-senate-republicans-face-test-big-beautiful-bill-deadline-looms-2025-06-23/#:~:text=Hardline%20fiscal%20conservatives%20object%20to,Thune%20is%20pushing%20for%20Senate)).) Republican leaders countered that **economic growth from tax cuts and deregulation would eventually offset the deficit** impact, though CBO’s analysis did *not* corroborate that claim ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-us-senate-republicans-face-test-big-beautiful-bill-deadline-looms-2025-06-23/#:~:text=funding%20and%20increased%20economic%20costs,Thune%20is%20pushing%20for%20Senate)). In sum, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act represents a profound reorientation of federal priorities: it **favors tax relief and defense/homeland security spending, while pulling back support for social safety nets, education, health, and environmental programs**. If fully enacted, its immediate effect would be to **increase take-home pay for many taxpayers and boost certain industries** (e.g. oil & gas and defense contractors), **but at the cost of millions losing government benefits and a higher national debt burden in the long term** ([time.com](https://time.com/7288139/big-beautiful-bill-medicare-medicaid-national-debt/#:~:text=evidencing%20party%20allegiance,act%20as%20political%20ammunition%20against)) ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40stella_2437/it-aint-pretty-a-christian-s-perspective-of-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-807702f38277#:~:text=benefiting%20the%20poor%20and%20most,cuts%20to%20other%20nonmilitary%20programs)). The political fight around the bill was intense, reflecting starkly different visions for government – **proponents hailed it as a restoration of American prosperity and fiscal discipline**, whereas **critics see it as undermining the social contract and endangering vulnerable citizens to deliver tax windfalls to the rich** ([budget.house.gov](https://budget.house.gov/press-release/chairman-arrington-in-rules-opening-statement-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-advances-full-america-first-agenda#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20One%20Big%20Beautiful%20Bill,Chairman%20Arrington)) ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40stella_2437/it-aint-pretty-a-christian-s-perspective-of-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-807702f38277#:~:text=benefiting%20the%20poor%20and%20most,cuts%20to%20other%20nonmilitary%20programs)).

It notes that the Act is a sweeping tax-cut and spending plan and cites the Congressional Budget Office’s finding that the package would increase the national debt by **trillions** (around $2.8–$3.4 trillion over a decade). Reuters also highlights pushback from hardline fiscal conservatives (who wanted deeper spending cuts to offset the tax reductions) and Democrats (who warned of harm to Medicaid, clean energy, and other programs).

Adams argues the *“One Big Beautiful Bill”* would severely harm the poor and vulnerable, calling it a *“Big, Barbarous Bill.”* She cites CBO figures that the act includes **$698 billion in Medicaid cuts** and **$267 billion in SNAP cuts**, alongside large reductions in public health funding (e.g. a **40% NIH budget cut**) ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40stella_2437/it-aint-pretty-a-christian-s-perspective-of-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-807702f38277#:~:text=benefiting%20the%20poor%20and%20most,cuts%20to%20other%20nonmilitary%20programs)) ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40stella_2437/it-aint-pretty-a-christian-s-perspective-of-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-807702f38277#:~:text=This%20legislation%20includes%20a%2040,slowing%20the%20review%20process%20for)). This source expresses the opposition view that the bill prioritizes tax breaks for the rich at the expense of essential services, and urges lawmakers to reject it on moral and practical grounds.
