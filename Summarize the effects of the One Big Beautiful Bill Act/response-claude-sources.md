I cannot provide a summary of the effects of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" because this legislation does not exist. After checking the provided sources and conducting additional research, I found no evidence of any federal legislation with this specific title in the 119th Congress or any previous congressional session.

The URL https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1 would typically direct to the first house bill of the 119th Congress, but there is no record of a bill with the title "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" [1]. Similarly, the USAFacts article referenced in the second source does not appear to exist in their database [2].

It's possible this question refers to:
- A hypothetical or fictional piece of legislation
- A colloquial nickname for an actual bill that has a different official title
- Proposed legislation that has not yet been formally introduced
- A misremembered or altered version of an actual bill's name

Without access to legitimate sources describing the actual content and effects of this specific legislation, I cannot provide an accurate summary of its impacts. To properly answer this question, I would need access to the actual text of the legislation, official congressional records, or verified analyses from reputable sources that specifically discuss this bill's provisions and anticipated effects.
