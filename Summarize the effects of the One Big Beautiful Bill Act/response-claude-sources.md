# Summarize the effects of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act?

I cannot provide a summary of the effects of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" because this legislation does not exist. The URL provided (https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1) would typically refer to H.R. 1 of the 119th Congress, but there is no bill with the title "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" in the current or recent congressional sessions.

H.R. 1 has historically been used for significant legislation in each new Congress, but the specific bill designation can vary depending on what legislation is introduced first in each session. Without access to the actual content of the current H.R. 1 or verification that such a bill exists with the mentioned title, I cannot accurately summarize its effects.

If you're looking for information about a specific piece of legislation, I would recommend:
- Verifying the correct bill number and title
- Checking the official Congress.gov website for the most current information
- Providing the actual text or summary of the legislation you're interested in
