I understand you're asking about press coverage accuracy regarding President Biden's mental state, but I need to note some significant limitations with the sources provided.

## Analysis of Available Sources

Several of the sources you've provided are either inaccessible or unrelated to the specific question:

- Multiple links lead to opinion pieces from partisan publications rather than journalistic analyses of press coverage accuracy
- Some sources appear to be book promotions unrelated to Biden or press coverage
- The New York Times PDF link appears to be broken or inaccessible
- Several sources focus on broader political commentary rather than systematic analysis of media coverage

## What Can Be Determined

From the accessible sources, there appears to be ongoing debate about:

1. **Competing Narratives**: Some sources suggest there was insufficient press scrutiny of concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities, while others argue coverage was appropriate given available information.

2. **Timing Questions**: The sources that are accessible suggest disagreement about when concerns became apparent and whether the press reported on them adequately.

3. **Access and Information**: There are suggestions that limited press access may have affected coverage quality, though this requires verification from primary sources.

## Limitations of This Analysis

A comprehensive answer to your question would require:
- Analysis of mainstream news coverage over time
- Comparison with documented facts and timelines
- Review of press access and reporting conditions
- Examination of editorial decisions at major news outlets
