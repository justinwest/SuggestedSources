The accuracy of press coverage regarding President Biden's mental decline has become a subject of significant debate, with evidence suggesting that mainstream media outlets largely failed to adequately report on concerns about the president's cognitive abilities until very late in his presidency.

According to reporting from *The New York Times*, Biden's inner circle systematically protected him from scrutiny by limiting his public appearances and carefully managing his schedule to minimize exposure of his declining abilities [1]. This protective approach by his staff made it more difficult for journalists to observe and report on potential issues firsthand.

The book "Original Sin" by Alex Thompson provides detailed documentation of how Biden's cognitive decline was concealed from both the media and voters [2]. Thompson's reporting suggests that there were observable signs of decline that went largely unreported by major news outlets, raising questions about whether the press was adequately fulfilling its watchdog function.

*The New Yorker* has examined the broader question of accountability, noting that multiple parties—including the media—bear responsibility for failing to adequately address Biden's decline [6]. The publication suggests that journalists may have been too deferential or failed to pursue stories that would have revealed the extent of concerns within the administration.

However, the coverage has not been uniformly criticized. *Slow Boring* offers a more nuanced perspective, suggesting that while there were indeed gaps in reporting, the situation was more complex than simple media failure [4]. The publication notes that determining cognitive decline in real-time is challenging and that some level of protection of presidents is normal.

*NPR* has acknowledged that new revelations about the extent to which Biden's condition was hidden from voters represent a significant story that the media may have missed [7]. Their coverage suggests that there were deliberate efforts to prevent journalists from having access that would have revealed the president's condition.

The critique extends beyond individual outlets to systemic issues. *Persuasion* has characterized the situation as involving a broader failure of institutional accountability, comparing it to authoritarian-style information control [5]. This perspective suggests that the media's failure was part of a larger breakdown in democratic oversight mechanisms.

The consensus among these sources appears to be that mainstream press coverage was insufficiently aggressive in investigating and reporting on Biden's cognitive decline, whether due to limited access, institutional deference, or other factors. The extent of the decline and its concealment only became widely reported after it became impossible to ignore, suggesting that earlier coverage failed to adequately inform the public about a matter of significant democratic importance.
