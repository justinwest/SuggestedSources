# How accurate was press coverage of President Biden's mental decline?

Based on the provided sources, there are conflicting views on the accuracy of press coverage regarding President Biden's mental decline. One perspective argues that the press was complicit in downplaying the issue, while another contends that the issue was covered extensively.

### The Press as Complicit in a "Cover-Up"

Author Franklin Foer argues in his articles and the book *Original Sin* that the press coverage of President Biden's condition was inaccurate due to self-censorship and a tacit agreement with the administration. Foer asserts that for three years, the White House and the press corps engaged in an "elaborate, unspoken pact" [5]. He claims the administration would deny that Biden's age was an issue, and the press—motivated by "sympathy, a sense of shared purpose, or a fear of sounding like a right-wing troll"—would "largely let the claim slide" [5].

According to this view, the press failed to "connect the dots" between individual gaffes and public miscues to report on the "bigger, harder, more painful story" of the president's "diminishment" [5]. The promotional material for Foer's book reinforces this, stating that it reveals the "full story of the cover-up of President Biden's tragic decline," which implies that previous reporting had been incomplete or misled by the White House's "spin machine" [2, 3]. Foer’s reporting suggests that Biden's inner circle actively protected a "faltering" president, carefully managing his public appearances to conceal the extent of his decline, which in turn skewed what the press could accurately report on [1].

### The Press as Having Covered the Issue Extensively

In contrast, Matthew Yglesias, writing in *Slow Boring*, argues that the notion of a "cover-up" is nonsensical because the press has covered the issue extensively. He states that President Biden's age and fitness have been a "central issue of his presidency" and a "constant topic of media discussion" [4].

Yglesias directly refutes the idea of a successful cover-up, arguing, "If this was a cover-up, it was the least successful cover-up of all time" [4]. He points out that "the whole world has been able to see that Joe Biden is old," and widespread public concern about the president's age and health, as reflected in polls, demonstrates that the press has not hidden this reality [4]. From this perspective, the press coverage has been accurate in its reflection of an observable reality that is well-understood by the public.
