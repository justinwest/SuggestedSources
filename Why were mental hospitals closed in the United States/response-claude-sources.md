# Why were mental hospitals closed in the United States?

Mental hospitals in the United States were closed as part of a large-scale policy shift known as deinstitutionalization, which occurred primarily from the 1950s through the 1980s. This movement was driven by multiple interconnected factors:

## Reform Movement and Exposés of Abuse

The deinstitutionalization movement gained momentum following widespread exposés of horrific conditions in state mental hospitals [1]. These institutions were often overcrowded, underfunded, and characterized by neglect and abuse of patients. Reform advocates argued that large state institutions were inherently dehumanizing and called for their closure [2].

## Development of Psychiatric Medications

The introduction of antipsychotic medications in the 1950s, particularly chlorpromazine (Thorazine), created new possibilities for treating mental illness outside of institutional settings [1]. These medications made it seem feasible to manage psychiatric conditions in community settings rather than requiring long-term hospitalization [3].

## Civil Rights and Legal Changes

The civil rights movement extended to mental health, with advocates arguing that involuntary commitment violated patients' constitutional rights. Legal reforms made it more difficult to commit individuals to mental hospitals against their will, emphasizing the principle of treating patients in the "least restrictive environment" [1][2].

## Economic Motivations

State governments faced significant financial pressure from the high costs of maintaining large psychiatric institutions. Federal programs like Medicaid, established in 1965, provided financial incentives for states to move patients out of state hospitals and into community settings, as federal funds could help cover community-based care costs [1][3].

## Community Mental Health Movement

The Community Mental Health Act of 1963, signed by President Kennedy, promised to replace large state hospitals with a network of community mental health centers that would provide outpatient care, crisis intervention, and other services in local communities [1][2].

## Inadequate Implementation

However, the promised community-based alternatives were never adequately funded or developed. Many community mental health centers were never built, and those that were established often lacked the resources to serve the most severely mentally ill individuals who had been discharged from state hospitals [2][3]. This gap between the promise and reality of community care has contributed to ongoing challenges, including homelessness and criminalization of mental illness.
