# Why were mental hospitals closed in the United States?

Of course. Here is a comprehensive, accurate, and well-structured response explaining why mental hospitals were closed in the United States.

### The Closure of Mental Hospitals: A Perfect Storm of Good Intentions and Unforeseen Consequences

The mass closure of state-run psychiatric hospitals in the United States, a process known as **deinstitutionalization**, was not a single event but a complex, decades-long shift that began in the mid-1950s and accelerated through the 1980s. It was driven by a convergence of social, medical, legal, and economic forces.

While the goal was a noble one—to move patients from often inhumane, isolated institutions to more humane, integrated community-based care—the execution was deeply flawed, leading to many of the modern challenges in mental healthcare, homelessness, and criminal justice.

The key reasons for the closure of mental hospitals can be broken down into four main categories:

---

#### 1. The "Push" from Awful Institutions: Social and Moral Outrage

By the mid-20th century, state mental hospitals, or "asylums," had largely failed to live up to their original therapeutic promise. They had become massive, overcrowded, and underfunded custodial warehouses. The conditions were frequently horrific:

*   **Abuse and Neglect:** Patients were often subjected to neglect, abuse, and inhumane "treatments" like ice-water baths, lobotomies, and electroshock therapy without anesthesia.
*   **Overcrowding and Understaffing:** Institutions designed for 1,500 patients might hold over 5,000, with minimal staff to provide any meaningful care. Patients were warehoused rather than treated.
*   **Public Exposés:** A series of powerful journalistic and artistic works shocked the public conscience. Books like Albert Deutsch's *The Shame of the States* (1948) and films like *The Snake Pit* (1948) and, later, Ken Kesey's novel *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest* (1962) exposed the grim reality of these institutions, creating a powerful moral and social push for reform.

This public outrage fueled a growing consensus that these large institutions were inherently harmful and that a better, more humane alternative was needed.

#### 2. The "Pull" of New Treatment: The Pharmaceutical Revolution

The discovery of the first effective antipsychotic medication was a watershed moment that made the idea of deinstitutionalization seem medically viable.

*   **The Introduction of Thorazine:** In 1954, the FDA approved **chlorpromazine (brand name: Thorazine)**. For the first time, a medication could effectively manage the most severe symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations and delusions.
*   **A New Hope for Treatment:** Thorazine and subsequent psychotropic drugs created immense optimism. The prevailing belief became that severe mental illness could be controlled with medication, allowing patients to live successfully and independently in the community. This "chemical revolution" provided the scientific rationale for emptying the asylums.

#### 3. The Legal and Political Shift: Civil Rights and Federal Action

The civil rights movement of the 1960s expanded to include rights for people with disabilities, including mental illness. The legal system began to challenge the practice of long-term, involuntary commitment.

*   **The Community Mental Health Act of 1963:** Championed by President John F. Kennedy, whose sister Rosemary had a developmental disability and was subjected to a lobotomy, this landmark legislation was the cornerstone of the new policy. The Act's vision was to create a national network of **Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs)**. These centers were intended to be the replacement for state hospitals, providing a full range of services: outpatient therapy, emergency care, and short-term inpatient beds, all within a patient's own community.
*   **Landmark Court Rulings:** A series of court decisions established crucial patient rights and made it much harder for states to keep people institutionalized.
    *   ***Wyatt v. Stickney* (1971):** Established that patients had a constitutional right to treatment and that care must be provided in the "least restrictive environment" necessary.
    *   ***O'Connor v. Donaldson* (1975):** The Supreme Court ruled that a state could not constitutionally confine a non-dangerous person who was capable of surviving safely in freedom by themselves or with the help of willing and responsible family or friends.

These legal and political changes provided the framework and the mandate to move people out of institutions.

#### 4. The Economic Incentive: Shifting the Financial Burden

Perhaps the most powerful and cynical driver of deinstitutionalization was economics.

*   **State vs. Federal Costs:** Running massive state hospitals was an enormous financial drain on state budgets.
*   **The Creation of Medicaid and Medicare (1965):** This was the financial game-changer. These new federal programs would pay for care in general hospitals and nursing homes. However, due to a provision known as the **"Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD) Exclusion,"** Medicaid would *not* pay for care for most adults in dedicated psychiatric hospitals.
*   **A Perverse Incentive:** This created a massive financial incentive for states. By closing their expensive state hospitals and discharging patients into the community, they could shift the financial burden of their care to the federal government via Medicaid, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), and Medicare. Patients were often moved to nursing homes or board-and-care facilities that were eligible for federal reimbursement, even if they were ill-equipped to handle severe mental illness.

### The Aftermath: Good Intentions, Devastating Reality

The vision of deinstitutionalization was never fully realized. While the "emptying out" of the hospitals was a success in pure numbers—the state hospital population plummeted from a peak of over 550,000 in the 1950s to under 40,000 today—the second, crucial part of the plan failed.

*   **The Failure of Community Mental Health Centers:** The nationwide network of CMHCs envisioned by President Kennedy was never adequately funded. Federal funding was cut shortly after the program began and was later converted into block grants to states, which often diverted the money to other priorities. As a result, the robust support system that was supposed to catch these patients simply wasn't there.
*   **Transinstitutionalization:** Instead of being cared for in the community, many people with severe mental illness were simply moved to other institutions not designed for them. This is known as **transinstitutionalization**. The new "asylums" became:
    *   **Jails and Prisons:** The Los Angeles County Jail, Rikers Island in New York, and Cook County Jail in Chicago are now the three largest de facto mental health facilities in the United States.
    *   **Homeless Shelters and the Streets:** Lack of housing, support, and treatment led directly to a surge in homelessness among people with severe mental illness.
    *   **Overburdened Families:** Many families were left to become the primary, unsupported caregivers for their severely ill relatives.

### Conclusion

The closure of America's mental hospitals was born from a desire to correct the injustices of the asylum system, powered by the promise of new medications, and cemented by legal and financial incentives. It was a policy of both idealism and expedience. However, the failure to build the promised community-based infrastructure resulted in a profound and ongoing crisis, leaving a legacy of homelessness, incarceration, and suffering for many of the most vulnerable people it was intended to help.
