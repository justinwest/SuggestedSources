# Why were mental hospitals closed in the United States?

The closure of large, state-run mental hospitals in the United States, a process known as deinstitutionalization, was not the result of a single decision but rather a complex and prolonged movement spanning several decades, primarily from the 1960s through the 1980s. It was driven by a confluence of social, legal, pharmaceutical, and economic factors.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the key reasons why these institutions were closed.

### 1. The Advent of Psychotropic Medications

The single most significant catalyst for deinstitutionalization was the development of effective antipsychotic medications. The introduction of **Thorazine (chlorpromazine)** in the mid-1950s revolutionized psychiatric care. For the first time, the severe symptoms of psychosis—such as hallucinations and delusions—could be medically managed. This created the belief that many individuals with serious mental illness, who were previously considered untreatable and confined for life, could now live successfully in the community with proper medication and support. These new drugs offered the promise of liberation from the asylum.

### 2. A Shift in Social and Philosophical Views

Public perception of large mental institutions soured dramatically in the post-World War II era. A growing human rights movement, combined with shocking exposés, revealed the often horrific conditions within these hospitals.

*   **Abuse and Neglect:** Journalistic investigations, books, and films portrayed state hospitals as overcrowded, understaffed "snake pits" where patients were subjected to neglect, abuse, and inhumane treatments like lobotomies and electroshock therapy without proper consent or regulation. Ken Kesey's 1962 novel *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest* became a powerful cultural symbol of this critique.
*   **Anti-Psychiatry and Civil Rights:** A parallel anti-psychiatry movement argued that institutionalization was an oppressive tool of social control rather than a therapeutic practice. Advocates framed the indefinite confinement of people with mental illness as a profound civil rights violation, arguing that individuals deserved to live in the "least restrictive environment" possible.

### 3. Legal and Civil Rights Advocacy

A series of landmark court rulings fundamentally changed the legal landscape of involuntary commitment, making it much more difficult for states to confine individuals against their will.

*   **Higher Standards for Commitment:** Courts began to require that for a person to be involuntarily committed, they must be proven to be an imminent danger to themselves or others, not just mentally ill.
*   ***O'Connor v. Donaldson* (1975):** In this pivotal Supreme Court case, the court ruled that a state cannot constitutionally confine a non-dangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom by themselves or with the help of family and friends. This decision affirmed patients' rights to liberty and severely limited the state's power to institutionalize people solely based on a diagnosis.

### 4. Federal Policy and Legislation

The federal government actively promoted the shift from institutional to community-based care. In 1963, **President John F. Kennedy**, whose sister Rosemary had a disability and was subjected to a lobotomy, signed the **Community Mental Health Act (CMHA)**.

*   **The Promise of Community Care:** The CMHA's goal was to create a nationwide network of Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs). The vision was that these local centers would provide a full range of services—including outpatient therapy, emergency care, and medication management—allowing patients to be treated while living at home. The plan was to build 1,500 centers to replace the old state hospital system.

### 5. Economic and Financial Incentives

While the other factors provided the moral and medical justification, financial pressures were a powerful driver for state governments.

*   **Cost-Shifting:** State hospitals were enormously expensive to operate, consuming a large portion of state budgets. By closing these facilities, states could shift the financial burden of care to the federal government.
*   **Medicaid and Medicare:** The creation of Medicaid and Medicare in 1965 inadvertently accelerated deinstitutionalization. These federal programs would not pay for care in a "psychiatric institution for mental diseases" but *would* cover care in general hospitals and nursing homes. This created a strong financial incentive for states to discharge patients from state hospitals and place them in facilities that qualified for federal funding, or simply release them into the community where they could be eligible for federal disability benefits (SSI/SSDI).

### The Unintended Consequences and Systemic Failure

While the intentions behind deinstitutionalization were largely noble, the execution was a catastrophic failure. The promise of a robust community-based support system was never realized.

*   **Chronic Underfunding:** The Community Mental Health Centers envisioned by President Kennedy were never adequately funded. The initial federal funding was for construction and startup, not long-term operation. As federal money dried up, states and local governments, facing their own budget crises, failed to provide the necessary sustained funding. Less than half of the proposed centers were ever built, and those that were often focused on treating less severe conditions, lacking the resources to handle individuals with serious and persistent mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
*   **Transinstitutionalization:** Deinstitutionalization did not end the confinement of people with mental illness; it simply changed the location. Lacking community support, many former patients ended up homeless or were incarcerated. Jails and prisons, particularly facilities like Rikers Island in New York and the Cook County Jail in Chicago, effectively became the new asylums, unequipped to provide proper psychiatric care.
*   **The Revolving Door:** Without a safety net, many individuals with serious mental illness entered a "revolving door" cycle of short-term psychiatric hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and life on the streets, never receiving the consistent care needed for stability.

In conclusion, mental hospitals were closed due to a "perfect storm" of factors: the hope offered by new medications, a moral backlash against inhumane conditions, legal rulings that protected patient rights, and a federal vision for community care. However, this movement was critically undermined by the financial incentive for states to shed costs and the subsequent systemic failure to fund and build the community-based infrastructure that was supposed to replace the old institutions. The result is the fragmented, under-resourced mental healthcare system that the United States still struggles with today.
