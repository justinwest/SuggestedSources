# Why were mental hospitals closed in the United States?

The closure of mental hospitals in the United States, often referred to as "deinstitutionalization," was a complex process that unfolded over several decades, primarily from the mid-20th century onward. This movement was driven by a combination of social, political, economic, and medical factors. Below is a comprehensive explanation of the key reasons behind the closure of many mental hospitals in the United States.

### 1. **Advancements in Psychiatric Treatment**
   - **Development of Psychotropic Medications**: In the 1950s, the introduction of antipsychotic medications, such as chlorpromazine (Thorazine), revolutionized the treatment of mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These drugs allowed many patients to manage their symptoms outside of institutional settings, reducing the perceived need for long-term hospitalization.
   - **Shift Toward Outpatient Care**: With effective medications, the focus of mental health treatment shifted from long-term institutionalization to community-based care, where patients could receive therapy and medication management while living in their communities.

### 2. **Changing Views on Mental Health and Human Rights**
   - **Criticism of Institutional Conditions**: By the mid-20th century, many mental hospitals (often called "asylums") were exposed as overcrowded, underfunded, and inhumane. Investigations and media reports, such as the 1946 exposé by journalist Albert Deutsch in his book *The Shame of the States*, revealed horrific conditions, including patient abuse, neglect, and lack of proper care.
   - **Civil Rights Movement Influence**: The broader civil rights movement of the 1960s emphasized individual freedoms and dignity, leading to increased advocacy for the rights of people with mental illnesses. Activists argued that institutionalization often stripped patients of autonomy and subjected them to dehumanizing treatment.
   - **Legal Reforms**: Landmark court cases, such as *O'Connor v. Donaldson* (1975), ruled that individuals could not be confined in mental institutions without evidence of danger to themselves or others and without adequate treatment. This decision reinforced the idea that institutionalization should be a last resort.

### 3. **Policy and Legislative Changes**
   - **Community Mental Health Act of 1963**: Signed by President John F. Kennedy, this legislation aimed to shift mental health care from large state hospitals to community-based mental health centers. The act provided federal funding for the construction of these centers, with the goal of offering localized, less restrictive care. However, the funding for these centers was often insufficient, and many were never built or adequately staffed.
   - **Medicaid and Medicare**: The introduction of these programs in 1965 inadvertently accelerated deinstitutionalization. Federal funding rules under Medicaid excluded coverage for care in "institutions for mental diseases" (IMDs) for adults aged 22-64, incentivizing states to move patients out of mental hospitals and into community settings or nursing homes, where costs could be partially covered by federal funds.

### 4. **Economic Pressures**
   - **Cost of Maintaining Hospitals**: State mental hospitals were expensive to operate, especially as patient populations grew and facilities aged. Many states saw deinstitutionalization as a way to reduce costs by closing hospitals and transferring responsibility for care to community programs or other systems.
   - **Budget Cuts**: During the 1970s and 1980s, economic challenges and shifts in political priorities led to significant cuts in mental health funding at both the state and federal levels. This made it difficult to maintain large institutions or to fully support the community-based care systems that were supposed to replace them.

### 5. **Rise of Community-Based Care Ideology**
   - **Normalization and Integration**: Mental health advocates and policymakers promoted the idea of "normalization," which emphasized integrating individuals with mental illnesses into society rather than isolating them in institutions. The belief was that community living would improve quality of life and reduce stigma.
   - **Influence of European Models**: Some European countries, such as Italy, began closing psychiatric hospitals in favor of community care models in the late 20th century. These examples inspired similar efforts in the United States.

### Consequences of Deinstitutionalization
While the closure of mental hospitals was driven by well-intentioned goals, the process had significant unintended consequences due to inadequate planning and funding:
   - **Lack of Community Support**: Many community mental health centers were underfunded or nonexistent, leaving former patients without access to necessary care, housing, or support services.
   - **Homelessness and Incarceration**: A significant number of individuals with mental illnesses ended up homeless or in the criminal justice system, as they lacked stable support systems. Studies suggest that a large proportion of the homeless population and incarcerated individuals suffer from untreated mental health conditions.
   - **Strain on Families and Emergency Services**: Without institutional or community support, families often became the primary caregivers, and emergency rooms and police became de facto responders to mental health crises.

### Conclusion
The closure of mental hospitals in the United States was driven by a combination of medical advancements, changing societal attitudes, legal and policy reforms, economic considerations, and a push for community-based care. While the intent was to improve the lives of individuals with mental illnesses by moving away from often inhumane institutional settings, the lack of adequate funding and infrastructure for community care led to significant gaps in the mental health system. Today, the legacy of deinstitutionalization continues to shape debates about how best to provide effective, compassionate care for those with mental illnesses, with ongoing calls for better funding, integrated services, and a balance between community care and specialized inpatient treatment when necessary.
