# Why were mental hospitals closed in the United States?

U.S. state psychiatric hospitals did not disappear for a single reason.  Their decline—patient census fell from about 560,000 in 1955 to fewer than 40,000 today—was driven by a cluster of medical, legal, economic, and political forces that converged after World War II.

1. Discovery of effective medications  
   • The introduction of antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine in the early 1950s made it possible for many patients to live outside locked wards and gave professionals confidence that community-based care could work [1][3].

2. Exposure of abuse and a change in public attitudes  
   • Investigative journalism, books, and photographs (e.g., Life magazine’s exposé of Willowbrook State School) showed overcrowding, violence, and neglect in state hospitals, convincing the public and legislators that the “asylums” were inhumane and obsolete [1][3].

3. The community-mental-health movement  
   • Led by psychiatrists, social workers, and President John F. Kennedy—whose 1963 Community Mental Health Centers Act promised 2,000 federally funded local clinics—reformers argued that people had a right to treatment in the “least restrictive setting” possible [1][2].

4. Civil-rights litigation and new legal standards  
   • Supreme Court and lower-court rulings (e.g., O’Connor v. Donaldson, 1975) held that patients could not be confined indefinitely unless they were dangerous and that they had due-process rights to refuse treatment, making long-term involuntary hospitalization harder to justify [1][2].

5. Fiscal incentives that favored discharging patients  
   • Large state hospitals were expensive, and governors faced pressure to cut budgets.  
   • The 1965 creation of Medicaid shifted mental-health costs from states to the federal government—but only for services delivered in facilities with 16 or fewer psychiatric beds; state hospitals were excluded, so states saved money by moving patients out [1][2].

6. Bipartisan political support for downsizing  
   • Liberals championed deinstitutionalization as a civil-rights victory; conservatives welcomed it as a way to shrink state government.  By the late 1970s, closing hospitals had become conventional wisdom across the political spectrum [2][3].

Because these forces operated simultaneously, governors and legislatures closed wards and entire institutions, confident that community clinics, group homes, and new drugs would fill the gap.  Many promised community services never materialized, but the reasons above explain why the hospitals themselves were shut down.
