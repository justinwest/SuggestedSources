# Why were mental hospitals closed in the United States?

Between the mid-1950s and the early 2000s the number of public psychiatric-hospital beds in the United States fell from about 560,000 to fewer than 40,000.  No single decision “closed the hospitals.”  Rather, five inter-locking forces—medical, humanitarian, legal, fiscal and ideological—pushed state governments to empty, merge or shutter their large institutions.

1. New treatments made life outside the hospital seem feasible  
   • Introduction of the first effective antipsychotic (chlorpromazine, 1954) and other psychotropic drugs allowed many patients to be stabilized on outpatient regimens instead of long-term custodial care [1].  
   • Psychiatrists and policy makers argued that these medicines, together with outpatient clinics, could replace the back wards of state hospitals.

2. Public exposés and a growing civil-rights ethic delegitimized the asylums  
   • Investigative articles such as LIFE magazine’s “Bedlam 1946” and later TV documentaries showed filth, overcrowding and abuse, shocking the public and lawmakers [4].  
   • Disability-rights and anti-psychiatry activists framed long-term commitment as a violation of liberty and pushed for “the least restrictive alternative” [1][3].

3. Federal policy redirected care to the community  
   • President Kennedy’s Community Mental Health Centers Act (1963) promised to replace every 600-bed state hospital with local clinics; by 1980 more than 700 CMHCs had been funded, giving states an alternative destination for discharged patients [1][2].  
   • The 1965 creation of Medicaid and Medicare excluded adults 22-64 who lived in “Institutions for Mental Disease.”  States could draw federal dollars only if they moved patients to general hospitals, nursing homes, or community programs, creating a powerful financial incentive to downsize or close state hospitals [1][3].

4. Courts raised the bar for involuntary commitment and length of stay  
   • Lessard v. Schmidt (1972) required the same due-process protections for civil commitment as for criminal detention.  
   • O’Connor v. Donaldson (1975) held that a non-dangerous person could not be confined solely for treatment.  
   • These and similar rulings forced hospitals to discharge thousands of long-term patients and made it harder to refill their beds [1][3].

5. State budget pressures made large institutions unsustainable  
   • By the late 1970s governors and legislatures discovered that closing aging hospitals was cheaper than renovating them or meeting the new staffing ratios mandated by lawsuits and accreditation bodies [5].  
   • California, often cited as an example, cut its state-hospital census by 36 % in the 1970s alone as part of larger efforts to reduce spending after a series of budget crises [2].

Ideological outcome  
The convergence of “drugs + rights + money” convinced leaders that people with serious mental illness would be better and more cheaply served in the community.  Unfortunately, many of the promised outpatient services were never fully funded, so a portion of the former state-hospital population drifted into homelessness or the criminal-justice system, producing today’s “de facto mental hospitals” in jails and prisons [3].

In short, U.S. mental hospitals were closed because:

• Effective medications and new treatment philosophies reduced the perceived need for custodial care.  
• Graphic evidence of abuse spurred a moral and civil-rights backlash.  
• Federal laws shifted dollars away from state institutions toward community settings.  
• Court decisions limited whom hospitals could confine and for how long.  
• States realized they could save money by shutting or selling deteriorating facilities.
