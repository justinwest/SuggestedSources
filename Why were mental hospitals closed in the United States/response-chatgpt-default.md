# Why were mental hospitals closed in the United States?

During the second half of the twentieth century the United States dismantled much of its large-scale public psychiatric hospital system—a process commonly called “deinstitutionalization.”  No single decision closed the hospitals; rather, converging medical, legal, economic, and political forces made the old state institution model increasingly untenable and encouraged a shift toward community-based care.  The principal factors were:

1. Therapeutic breakthroughs and changing clinical thinking  
   •  Introduction of effective antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing drugs (e.g., chlorpromazine in 1954, lithium in 1949, haloperidol in 1958) convinced clinicians that many patients could function outside locked wards.  
   •  The growing discipline of social psychiatry argued that long-term custodial care actually harmed patients through “institutionalism” and that treatment should occur in the “least restrictive setting.”

2. Civil-rights and patients’-rights movements  
   •  Exposés (e.g., Life magazine’s 1946 “Bedlam 1946,” the 1972 TV documentary on Willowbrook) revealed neglect and abuse, galvanizing public opinion against large institutions.  
   •  Legal advocacy organizations pressed for the rights to refuse treatment, to live in integrated settings, and to due process before commitment.  
   •  Landmark court cases—O’Connor v. Donaldson (1975), Wyatt v. Stickney (1971), Lessard v. Schmidt (1972)—restricted involuntary hospitalization and required treatment in the least restrictive environment.  These rulings made long, indeterminate confinement harder to justify and more expensive to defend.

3. Federal policy and funding incentives  
   •  The 1963 Community Mental Health Centers Act committed federal dollars to outpatient, day-treatment, and emergency services and implicitly defined hospital care as a last resort.  
   •  Medicaid and Medicare (1965) introduced the “IMD exclusion”: federal reimbursement is barred for most individuals 22–64 years old in “Institutions for Mental Diseases.”  States therefore found it cheaper to move patients into settings (nursing homes, general hospitals, community programs) that could bill Medicaid.  
   •  Supplemental Security Income (SSI, 1972) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) provided personal income in the community, further supporting discharge.  

4. State fiscal pressures  
   •  State hospitals were expensive: by the 1950s they consumed 30–50 % of many state health budgets.  Because states funded hospitals but the federal government paid most outpatient costs after 1965, states had a strong fiscal incentive to empty beds.  
   •  Politically, governors and legislatures preferred to close aging facilities rather than raise taxes for modernization when Washington seemed ready to underwrite community care.

5. Professional and ideological shifts in social policy  
   •  The broader disability-rights mantra of “normalization” and “integration” paralleled movements to close institutions for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  
   •  Academic critiques characterized asylums as instruments of social control rather than medical care (e.g., Erving Goffman’s “Total Institution” thesis), delegitimizing the hospital model.

6. Incremental, facility-specific catalysts  
   •  Consent decrees following Justice Department investigations, class-action lawsuits, or loss of accreditation often mandated costly upgrades that states chose to avoid by shutting hospitals altogether.  
   •  Some hospitals sat on valuable real estate; selling or repurposing the land generated revenue.

Consequences (briefly)  
•  The inpatient census plunged from roughly 560,000 public psychiatric beds in 1955 to fewer than 40,000 today.  
•  Many people flourished in the community, yet promised outpatient, housing, and vocational supports were underfunded or never built.  A portion of the severely ill population has cycled among emergency rooms, jails, shelters, and streets—a phenomenon sometimes called “trans-institutionalization.”  

In summary, American mental hospitals closed not because mental illness disappeared but because new medications, civil-rights litigation, federal financing mechanisms, state budget incentives, and changing professional ideals all converged to make large, isolated institutions appear unnecessary, unjust, and unaffordable.  The rapid downsizing succeeded in ending much abusive custodial care, but the failure to invest adequately in community services left significant gaps that remain a challenge today.
