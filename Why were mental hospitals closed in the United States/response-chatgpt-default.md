# Why were mental hospitals closed in the United States?

Why were mental hospitals closed in the United States?  
The short answer—“deinstitutionalization”—is only a label.  Behind it lay several converging medical, legal, economic, political, and social forces that unfolded between the 1950s and early 2000s.  Taken together, these forces made the large state‐run psychiatric hospitals that once housed hundreds of thousands of people seem medically outdated, legally indefensible, and financially unsustainable, while encouraging the belief that patients would fare better in their own communities.  Below is a structured explanation of those forces, the policy steps that translated them into action, and the results.

────────────────────────────────────────
1.  Historical baseline: the state hospital era
────────────────────────────────────────
•  19th–mid-20th century: Every state built large “asylums” that often grew into self-contained towns with 2,000–10,000 patients each.  
•  Peak census (1955): ~560,000 patients in state hospitals (1 in every 300 Americans).  
•  By 2018: <40,000 state beds—>90 % reduction.

────────────────────────────────────────
2.  Catalysts for closing the hospitals
────────────────────────────────────────
A.  Medical and therapeutic advances  
   •  1954: FDA approval of chlorpromazine (Thorazine) demonstrated that many patients with psychosis could be stabilized outside locked wards.  
   •  Subsequent antipsychotics, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers reinforced the belief that long-term institutional care was no longer medically necessary for most.

B.  Exposés of abuse and public opinion  
   •  1946: Life magazine’s “Bedlam 1946” photo essay.  
   •  1961: Erving Goffman’s “Asylums.”  
   •  1972: Geraldo Rivera’s TV exposé of Willowbrook State School.  
   These and other investigations portrayed state hospitals as places of neglect, squalor, and sometimes outright brutality, eroding political support for their continued operation.

C.  Civil-rights and disability-rights movements  
   •  Shift from custodial to rights-based thinking: Persons with mental illness were citizens entitled to freedom, dignity, and “the least restrictive setting.”  
   •  Advocacy groups (e.g., National Alliance on Mental Illness, American Civil Liberties Union) pushed to end indefinite confinement.

D.  Changing legal landscape  
   •  Lake v. Cameron (D.C. Cir., 1966): Established the “least restrictive alternative” principle.  
   •  Wyatt v. Stickney (M.D. Ala., 1971): Mandated “treatment, not mere custodial care,” making warehousing illegal.  
   •  O’Connor v. Donaldson (U.S. Supreme Court, 1975): States cannot confine a non-dangerous person capable of living safely in freedom.  
   •  Addington v. Texas (1979): Raised the standard of proof for civil commitment to “clear and convincing” evidence.  
   These rulings made it harder and costlier to keep people hospitalized against their will.

E.  Federal policy and financing changes  
   1. Community Mental Health Centers Act (1963)  
      •  Signed by President Kennedy; envisioned 1,500 federally funded local centers to supplant state hospitals.  
   2. Medicare & Medicaid (1965)  
      •  Excluded “institutions for mental diseases” (IMDs) from federal reimbursement for adults 22–64.  
      •  States suddenly had a fiscal incentive to move patients from state hospitals (100 % state dollars) to general hospitals or community programs (50–83 % federal dollars).  
   3. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) & Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) (1972)  
      •  Gave released patients a small income stream, making discharge appear more viable.  
   4. Block-granting of mental-health funds under Presidents Nixon and Reagan  
      •  Further reduced earmarked federal dollars for inpatient care while giving states flexibility to cut institutional budgets.

F.  State-level fiscal pressures  
   •  Running a large hospital cost $60,000–$100,000 per patient per year (2020 dollars).  
   •  Legislatures, facing rising Medicaid, education, and infrastructure bills, saw hospital closure as a quick way to balance budgets.

────────────────────────────────────────
3.  Implementation: how the closures unfolded
────────────────────────────────────────
•  1955–1975: Early “deinstitutionalization”—slow but steady downsizing; many geriatric and stable patients discharged.  
•  1975–1990: Court rulings and Medicaid incentives accelerate closures; creation of regional medical centers; private-sector psychiatric units expand for short-stay care.  
•  1990s–2000s: Most remaining large hospitals either closed outright or shrank to a few hundred forensic or acute beds.  States sold campuses or converted them to prisons, colleges, condos, or museum space.

────────────────────────────────────────
4.  What was supposed to replace the hospitals?
────────────────────────────────────────
•  Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) were intended to deliver five “core services”: inpatient, outpatient, partial hospitalization, emergency, and consultation/education.  
•  The original plan called for 2,000 CMHCs by 1980; only ~750 materialized, many without 24-hour coverage or assertive outreach.  
•  Long-term residential options (group homes, supportive housing) never matched the scale of the hospital beds that closed.

────────────────────────────────────────
5.  Consequences—mixed at best
────────────────────────────────────────
Successes  
   •  Millions lived freer lives, closer to family, with better civil rights.  
   •  New therapies and peer-support models flourished.

Problems  
   •  Revolving-door hospitalizations: Average stay fell from months/years to days.  
   •  “Trans-institutionalization”: Jails and prisons became de facto psychiatric facilities; by 2020, the U.S. incarcerated more people with serious mental illness than it hospitalized.  
   •  Homelessness: Estimates suggest 25–35 % of unsheltered adults have a serious mental disorder.  
   •  Community-service gaps: Many regions still lack crisis teams, assertive community treatment (ACT), or supportive housing.

────────────────────────────────────────
6.  Bottom line
────────────────────────────────────────
Mental hospitals in the United States were not closed for a single reason but because a constellation of scientific advances, legal rulings, civil-rights ideals, financial incentives, and political decisions all converged on the same conclusion: long-term, large-scale institutionalization was no longer the preferred—or affordable—way to care for people with serious mental illness.  The moral goal was community integration; the practical realities of funding and implementation, however, left major cracks in the system that remain visible today.
