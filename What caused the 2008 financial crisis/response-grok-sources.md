# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

### What Caused the 2008 Financial Crisis?

The 2008 financial crisis, often referred to as the Great Recession, was a severe global economic downturn that marked one of the most significant financial collapses since the Great Depression. It was triggered by a complex interplay of factors within the housing market, financial institutions, regulatory failures, and broader economic policies. Below is a comprehensive analysis of the primary causes of the crisis, drawing from the provided sources and additional research for clarity and depth.

#### 1. The Subprime Mortgage Boom and Risky Lending Practices
A central cause of the 2008 financial crisis was the rapid expansion of subprime mortgages—loans given to borrowers with poor credit histories who were unlikely to repay them. In the early 2000s, low interest rates and a housing boom encouraged lenders to issue mortgages to high-risk borrowers, often with little to no documentation of income or assets, known as "no-doc loans" [1][4]. These loans were aggressively marketed by institutions like Countrywide Financial, which prioritized volume over quality, leading to widespread predatory lending practices [5]. The assumption was that rising home prices would allow borrowers to refinance or sell their homes at a profit, mitigating the risk of default. However, this assumption proved disastrous when the housing bubble burst.

#### 2. Securitization and Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)
The proliferation of subprime mortgages was exacerbated by the financial innovation of securitization, where mortgages were bundled into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and further repackaged into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These complex financial instruments were sold to investors worldwide, often with inflated credit ratings from agencies like Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, which underestimated the underlying risk [6]. This process obscured the true risk of the loans, as banks and investors believed they were diversified and safe. When borrowers began defaulting en masse, the value of these securities plummeted, causing massive losses for financial institutions [3][7].

#### 3. Housing Bubble and Speculative Behavior
The housing market in the United States experienced a speculative bubble in the early 2000s, driven by easy credit, low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, and a cultural belief that home prices would perpetually rise [2][3]. This environment encouraged speculative buying, with many individuals purchasing homes as investments rather than residences, often using adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) with initially low "teaser" rates that later spiked. When interest rates rose and home prices began to decline in 2006-2007, many borrowers found themselves underwater—owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth—leading to widespread defaults and foreclosures [2].

#### 4. Regulatory Failures and Deregulation
Regulatory oversight failed to keep pace with the rapid growth of risky financial practices. The repeal of key provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999 allowed commercial and investment banks to merge, increasing systemic risk by combining traditional banking with speculative activities [7]. Additionally, regulators and policymakers underestimated the risks posed by subprime lending and complex derivatives like CDOs. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) report highlighted that government policies, including those promoting homeownership through entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, inadvertently encouraged risky lending by providing implicit guarantees to mortgage-backed securities [7]. Meanwhile, lax enforcement of lending standards allowed predatory practices to flourish [5].

#### 5. Excessive Leverage and Systemic Risk
Financial institutions took on excessive debt to finance their investments in mortgage-backed securities and other risky assets, often leveraging their capital at ratios as high as 30:1. This meant that even small declines in asset values could wipe out their equity, leading to insolvency. When the housing market collapsed, major institutions like Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and AIG faced catastrophic losses, triggering a liquidity crisis and a loss of confidence in the financial system [3][7]. The interconnectedness of global financial markets, amplified by the widespread distribution of CDOs, meant that the crisis quickly spread beyond the United States, affecting economies worldwide.

#### 6. Role of Credit Rating Agencies and Misaligned Incentives
Credit rating agencies played a significant role in the crisis by assigning overly optimistic ratings to mortgage-backed securities and CDOs, often due to conflicts of interest, as they were paid by the very institutions whose products they rated [7]. This gave investors a false sense of security. Additionally, misaligned incentives within the financial system—such as bonuses for loan officers based on volume rather than quality, and the "originate-to-distribute" model where lenders sold off loans without retaining risk—encouraged reckless behavior at multiple levels [1][5].

#### Conclusion
The 2008 financial crisis was the result of a perfect storm of factors: the subprime mortgage boom fueled by risky lending and speculative behavior, the creation and distribution of toxic financial products like CDOs, regulatory failures, excessive leverage by financial institutions, and systemic misaligned incentives. The collapse of the housing bubble exposed these vulnerabilities, leading to widespread defaults, bank failures, and a global economic downturn. The crisis underscored the need for stronger financial regulation, better risk assessment, and more responsible lending practices to prevent similar catastrophes in the future.
