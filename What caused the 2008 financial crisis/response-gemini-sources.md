# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

The 2008 financial crisis was not caused by a single event but was the result of a combination of interconnected factors that created a "perfect storm" in the global financial system. The core elements included a massive housing bubble fueled by low interest rates, a dramatic decline in lending standards, the creation of complex and poorly understood financial instruments that hid and amplified risk, and a systemic failure of regulation and corporate governance [7].

### Key Causes of the 2008 Financial Crisis

**1. The Housing Bubble and Low Interest Rates**
In the early 2000s, in an effort to combat a mild recession and the economic effects of the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate from 6.5% in 2000 to just 1% by 2003 [3]. This made borrowing money extremely cheap, encouraging investment and spending. A significant portion of this cheap money flowed into the real estate market, fueling a rapid and unsustainable increase in housing prices, which came to be known as the U.S. housing bubble [3, 7]. The widespread belief that housing prices would only continue to rise created a speculative frenzy among both homebuyers and lenders [7].

**2. Decline in Lending Standards and Subprime Mortgages**
As the housing bubble expanded, lenders began to exhaust the pool of creditworthy "prime" borrowers. To continue generating profits, they dramatically lowered their lending standards and began aggressively marketing high-risk "subprime" mortgages to borrowers with poor credit histories and a limited ability to repay [3, 7].

Key features of this decline in standards included:
*   **Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs):** These loans offered a low introductory "teaser" rate that would later reset to a much higher variable rate, leading to payment shock for unprepared borrowers [3].
*   **No-Documentation Loans:** Known as "liar loans" or NINJA loans (No Income, No Job, or Assets), these mortgages required little to no verification of a borrower's income or assets, making them susceptible to fraud [4].
*   **Predatory Lending:** Lenders like Countrywide Financial created high-pressure sales environments where loan officers were incentivized to push borrowers into risky, expensive subprime loans, regardless of their ability to pay. Countrywide's "Hustle" program was a prime example of this practice, prioritizing loan volume over quality [5].

**3. Government Policies and Affordable Housing Goals**
Some analysts argue that long-standing government policies promoting homeownership played a critical role in creating the demand for subprime loans. Beginning in the 1990s, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) mandated that government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac meet "affordable housing goals," requiring them to purchase an increasing percentage of mortgages made to low- and moderate-income borrowers [1]. By the 2000s, these goals pushed Fannie and Freddie to buy trillions of dollars in subprime and other risky mortgages to meet their quotas, effectively creating a massive, government-backed market for these loans [1, 2]. While the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) found that these goals were not the primary cause, it acknowledged they contributed to the market for high-risk loans [7].

**4. Securitization and Complex Financial Instruments**
The risk from individual subprime mortgages was bundled, hidden, and spread throughout the global financial system via a process called securitization [7].
*   Lenders adopted an "originate-to-distribute" model, where they would issue a mortgage and immediately sell it to an investment bank, passing the risk on to someone else. This removed the incentive for lenders to ensure the borrower could actually repay the loan [5, 7].
*   Investment banks bundled thousands of these mortgages together into **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)** and sold them to investors.
*   The riskiest portions of these MBS were often repackaged into even more complex instruments called **Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)** [6]. Through financial engineering, these CDOs were sliced into different risk levels, or "tranches." Inexplicably, credit rating agencies gave the majority of these CDO tranches their highest "AAA" rating, making them appear to be as safe as government bonds [6, 7].

**5. Failures of Regulation and Credit Rating Agencies**
The crisis was underpinned by a massive failure of regulation and oversight [7].
*   **Credit Rating Agencies:** Moody's and Standard & Poor's faced severe conflicts of interest, as they were paid by the same investment banks whose products they were rating. They gave unjustifiably high ratings to risky CDOs, which misled investors and fueled demand for the toxic assets [7].
*   **Regulatory Gaps:** The FCIC concluded that the government was ill-prepared for the crisis, citing widespread failures in financial regulation. Regulators like the Federal Reserve failed to rein in the explosion of risky mortgage lending, while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) failed to require major investment banks to hold adequate capital to absorb the losses they were exposed to through their CDO holdings [7]. This largely unregulated "shadow banking system" allowed risk to grow to catastrophic levels without proper oversight [3, 7].

When the housing bubble burst in 2006-2007, homeowners began defaulting on their subprime mortgages in record numbers. This rendered the MBS and CDOs built upon them virtually worthless, inflicting catastrophic losses on the banks and financial institutions that held them. This led to the collapse of major firms like Lehman Brothers, a freeze in global credit markets, and the most severe economic recession since the Great Depression [3, 7].
