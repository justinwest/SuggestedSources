# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

The 2008 financial crisis was not caused by a single event but by a convergence of factors that created a "perfect storm" in the U.S. housing market and the global financial system. The primary causes included a housing bubble fueled by low interest rates and lax lending standards, the creation of complex and poorly understood financial products that spread risk globally, significant failures in corporate governance and government regulation, and explicit government policies designed to expand homeownership [1, 7].

### 1. The Housing Bubble and Risky Lending
Following the dot-com bust and the September 11th attacks, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to stimulate the economy, making mortgages cheap and fueling a speculative boom in U.S. housing prices [3, 7]. This environment was amplified by a strong political and policy push from successive administrations to increase homeownership rates across the country [2, 8, 9].

To meet the surging demand for mortgages, lending standards were significantly relaxed. This led to the proliferation of high-risk "subprime" mortgages offered to borrowers with poor credit histories [3]. Many of these were adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) that began with low "teaser" rates that would later reset to much higher payments. Lenders also increasingly offered "no-documentation" or "low-documentation" loans (sometimes called "liar loans"), which did not require borrowers to provide proof of their income, encouraging fraud and lending to people who could not afford the homes they were buying [4, 7]. Mortgage lenders like Countrywide Financial actively pushed these risky products, incentivizing loan officers with commissions to generate a high volume of loans, regardless of their quality or the borrower's ability to repay [5].

### 2. Financial Engineering and the Spread of Risk
The risk from these individual mortgages was amplified and spread throughout the global financial system through a process called securitization. Lenders did not hold onto the mortgages they created; instead, they sold them to investment banks, which bundled thousands of them together to create Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) [3, 7].

These securities were then sliced into more complex products called Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs). A CDO pools various debt assets and separates them into tranches, or layers, of risk. The senior tranches were considered the safest and received the highest credit ratings (often AAA), while the junior tranches were riskier but offered higher returns [6].

This system created immense demand for new mortgages to be fed into the securitization machine, which further encouraged loose lending standards [1, 5]. Crucially, the credit rating agencies gave high, safe ratings to a vast number of these complex and risky securities. Investors, including pension funds and banks around the world, bought these AAA-rated CDOs, believing they were safe investments [7].

### 3. Regulatory and Policy Failures
The crisis was underpinned by widespread failures in regulation and oversight.
*   **Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs)**: Government policy explicitly encouraged this behavior. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) set ambitious "affordable housing goals" for government-sponsored entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A 2004 regulation, for example, mandated that 50% of the mortgages they purchased be for low- and moderate-income families [10]. By purchasing vast quantities of subprime and other risky mortgages, Fannie and Freddie signaled to the market that there was a stable, government-backed buyer for these loans, which fueled their creation [2, 7].
*   **Lack of Oversight**: Federal regulators failed to rein in the irresponsible lending practices of banks and non-bank lenders like Countrywide [7]. There was a systemic failure to understand and regulate the new financial products like CDOs and the credit default swaps designed to insure them.
*   **Breakdown of Responsibility**: Many economists argue that the complex chain of securitization led to a breakdown in responsibility. The mortgage broker, the original lender, the investment bank, the rating agency, and the final investor each assumed someone else in the chain had properly vetted the risk [1].

### 4. The Collapse
The housing bubble began to deflate in 2006-2007. As home prices fell, many homeowners found themselves "underwater," owing more on their mortgage than their house was worth. Simultaneously, the low teaser rates on subprime ARMs began to reset to higher monthly payments. Unable to refinance due to falling home values and unable to afford the new payments, millions of homeowners defaulted on their mortgages [3, 7].

These defaults caused the value of MBS and CDOs to plummet. Financial institutions that held these assets or had insured them suffered catastrophic losses. This triggered a credit crisis, as banks became terrified to lend to anyone, including each other. The panic culminated in September 2008 with the failure of Lehman Brothers, a major investment bank, which sent shockwaves through the global financial system and tipped the world economy into a severe recession [3, 7].
