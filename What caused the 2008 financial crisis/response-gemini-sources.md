# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

The 2008 financial crisis, the most severe economic disaster since the Great Depression, was not caused by a single event but by a combination of interconnected factors that created a "perfect storm" in the U.S. housing and financial markets. The core of the crisis was the collapse of a massive housing bubble, the effects of which were amplified and transmitted globally through complex and poorly regulated financial instruments [3, 7].

Key causes of the crisis include:

### 1. The U.S. Housing Bubble
In the early 2000s, a combination of factors led to a dramatic and unsustainable rise in housing prices. Following the dot-com bust and the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate from 6.5% to 1% by 2003 to stimulate the economy. This made borrowing money extremely cheap [3, 7]. Concurrently, a "global savings glut," with large capital inflows from foreign countries, pushed long-term interest rates down and created immense demand for higher-yielding U.S. investments, a demand that mortgage-backed securities seemed to satisfy [3]. This easy credit and high demand for homes drove housing prices to unprecedented levels, creating a nationwide bubble [7].

### 2. Subprime Mortgages and Lax Lending Standards
To fuel the housing boom, mortgage lenders dramatically lowered their standards, issuing increasingly risky loans to borrowers with poor credit histories. This practice became known as subprime lending [3]. A key feature of this era was the proliferation of loans that required little to no verification of the borrower's income or assets, which were often called "no-doc" or "liar loans" [4].

Several factors drove this decline in standards:
*   **Government Policy:** Some analyses argue that federal government policies promoting affordable housing and homeownership played a significant role. Initiatives like the Community Reinvestment Act and affordable housing goals set for government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac created pressure on lenders to extend credit to lower-income borrowers who would not have previously qualified [1, 2].
*   **The "Originate-to-Distribute" Model:** Lenders no longer held the mortgages they originated. Instead, they sold them to be packaged into securities, shifting the risk to investors. This created a powerful incentive to generate a high volume of loans, regardless of their quality, to earn fees [5, 7].
*   **Predatory Lending:** As seen in the case of major lenders like Countrywide Financial, loan officers were pressured by a system called "The Hustle" to approve and close large numbers of risky loans, often with deceptive features like "teaser" interest rates that would later balloon to unaffordable levels [5].

### 3. Securitization and Complex Financial Products
These risky subprime mortgages were bundled together by the thousands into financial products called mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and, more complexly, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) [6, 7].

A CDO is a financial instrument that pools together cash flow-generating assets—in this case, primarily mortgage payments—and repackages them into discrete tranches (or slices) that are then sold to investors [6]. The senior tranches were considered safest, while the junior "equity" tranches were riskiest. The theory was that by diversifying the mortgages across a large pool, the risk of default would be minimized. However, the models failed to account for a nationwide housing downturn where a vast number of mortgages would default simultaneously [3, 7].

The complexity of these instruments made it nearly impossible for investors to understand the true risk of the underlying assets. This opacity was made worse by credit rating agencies, which gave many of these risky CDOs AAA ratings—the highest possible rating, suggesting they were as safe as U.S. government bonds. This high rating was crucial, as it allowed pension funds, insurance companies, and other institutional investors to purchase these securities, spreading the risk of the U.S. subprime market throughout the global financial system [6, 7].

### 4. Widespread Failures in Regulation and Supervision
The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC), a body appointed by the U.S. government, concluded that the crisis was ultimately avoidable and was caused by "widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision" [7]. Key failures included:
*   **Lack of Oversight:** Regulators failed to rein in the explosion of subprime lending and predatory practices.
*   **Capital Requirements:** Major investment banks were allowed to operate with dangerously high levels of leverage (debt), meaning even small losses on their assets could render them insolvent.
*   **Unregulated Markets:** The market for complex derivatives like CDOs and credit default swaps (CDS)—a form of insurance on these products—was almost entirely unregulated, allowing risk to build up in the shadows of the financial system [7].

### The Collapse
Beginning in 2006, the housing bubble began to deflate. As interest rates on adjustable-rate mortgages reset to higher levels, and with home values falling, many subprime borrowers could neither pay their mortgages nor refinance. Defaults and foreclosures skyrocketed [3].

This wave of defaults caused the value of MBS and CDOs to plummet. Financial institutions holding these assets suffered catastrophic losses. Because no one was sure which banks held the toxic assets, trust evaporated, and credit markets froze. Banks stopped lending to each other and to the public. In September 2008, the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers triggered a full-blown panic, leading to a cascade of failures and near-failures that required massive government bailouts to prevent the collapse of the entire global financial system [3, 7].
