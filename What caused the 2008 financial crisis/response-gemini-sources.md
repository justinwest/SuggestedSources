# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

The 2008 financial crisis was a global economic downturn triggered by the collapse of the United States housing market. While the immediate cause was a wave of defaults on subprime mortgages, the crisis stemmed from a complex and interconnected set of factors that developed over many years. These include government housing policies, flawed financial innovations, and significant regulatory failures.

### Key Causes of the Crisis

1.  **U.S. Government Housing Policy**
    A central cause, highlighted in the provided sources, was a multi-decade effort by the U.S. government to increase homeownership, particularly among lower-income and minority households [1, 2]. This policy was advanced by both Democratic and Republican administrations. Key mechanisms included:
    *   **The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA):** Originally passed in 1977 and significantly expanded in the 1990s, the CRA pressured banks to increase lending in low- and moderate-income communities [1].
    *   **Affordable Housing Goals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac:** These Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) were mandated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to purchase an increasing percentage of mortgages made to borrowers with below-average incomes. This created a massive, government-backed secondary market for what would become subprime loans [1].

    These policies created powerful incentives for lenders to lower their underwriting standards. Lenders knew they could originate high-risk loans and then sell them to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, transferring the risk off their own books. This "originate-to-distribute" model fueled a boom in subprime mortgage lending [1]. The Bush administration's "ownership society" initiative further amplified this push, framing increased minority homeownership as a key social goal [2].

2.  **The Housing Bubble and Subprime Lending**
    The push for expanded homeownership coincided with a period of historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve in the early 2000s to combat a mild recession [3]. This made borrowing exceptionally cheap, fueling a speculative bubble in housing prices. As prices rose, many saw real estate as a foolproof investment, further increasing demand.

    Lenders offered increasingly risky mortgage products to capture this demand, including:
    *   **Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs):** These offered low "teaser" interest rates that would reset to much higher rates after a few years.
    *   **No-Income, No-Job, No-Assets (NINJA) Loans:** Mortgages given with little to no verification of the borrower's ability to pay.

3.  **Financial Innovation and Securitization**
    Wall Street created complex financial instruments that bundled these risky mortgages together and sold them to investors worldwide. This process, known as securitization, was central to the crisis:
    *   **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS):** Thousands of individual mortgages were pooled together and sold as bonds.
    *   **Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs):** The riskiest parts of MBS pools were often repackaged into new securities called CDOs.

    This system diffused risk so widely that it became difficult to track. It also created a moral hazard, as the original lenders were no longer exposed to the long-term risk of the loans they created [3].

4.  **Failures in Regulation and Credit Ratings**
    The system was enabled by significant failures in oversight:
    *   **Credit Rating Agencies:** Agencies like Moody's and Standard & Poor's gave top-tier (AAA) ratings to many of these risky MBS and CDOs. These ratings were deeply flawed and misled investors into believing the securities were safe [3].
    *   **Lack of Regulation:** The market for derivatives, such as **Credit Default Swaps (CDS)**—essentially insurance policies on MBS and CDOs—was almost completely unregulated. When the securities failed, firms like AIG, which had sold massive numbers of CDS, could not cover the losses, requiring a government bailout [3].

### The Collapse

The system began to unravel in 2006-2007. As housing prices stagnated and began to fall, many homeowners could no longer refinance their loans. When the low introductory rates on their adjustable-rate mortgages expired, their monthly payments skyrocketed, leading to a wave of defaults.

These defaults caused the value of MBS and CDOs to plummet. Financial institutions around the world that held these securities—including investment banks, commercial banks, and pension funds—suffered catastrophic losses. This triggered a severe credit crunch, as banks became unwilling to lend to each other due to uncertainty over who was exposed to the toxic assets. The crisis culminated in the failure or near-failure of major institutions like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG in 2008, freezing the global financial system and precipitating a deep recession.

    *   The author, Arnold Kling, argues that the primary cause of the crisis was not private-sector greed but misguided government policy. He contends that federal mandates, particularly the "affordable housing goals" imposed on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, created a huge, artificial market for subprime mortgages, incentivizing lenders to abandon traditional underwriting standards.

    *   The author, Steve Sailer, places the blame squarely on a bipartisan political push to increase minority homeownership, which he describes as a form of social engineering. He argues that this agenda, most visibly promoted by the Bush administration's "ownership society," forced the financial system to lend to uncreditworthy borrowers by leveraging the power of the Community Reinvestment Act and mandates on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

    *   This source, summarizing the findings of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC), presents a multi-causal view. It attributes the crisis to widespread failures in financial regulation, lapses in corporate governance that led to excessive risk-taking, an explosive mix of cheap credit and a global savings glut, and a breakdown in lending standards by lenders who passed the risk on to others through securitization. It concludes that the crisis was avoidable and not the result of a single factor.
