# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

The 2008 financial crisis resulted from a complex web of interconnected factors that created a perfect storm in the global financial system. Here are the primary causes:

## Housing Bubble and Subprime Mortgages

The crisis originated in the U.S. housing market, where a massive bubble developed throughout the early 2000s. Financial institutions increasingly issued subprime mortgages—loans to borrowers with poor credit histories or insufficient income documentation. These risky loans were often structured with teaser rates that later reset to much higher payments, making them unaffordable for many borrowers.

## Deregulation and Regulatory Failures

Key regulatory changes contributed significantly to the crisis:
- The repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999 allowed commercial and investment banking to merge
- Reduced oversight of financial derivatives markets
- Inadequate regulation of credit rating agencies
- Failure to properly supervise systemically important financial institutions

## Securitization and Complex Financial Instruments

Banks packaged mortgages into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), spreading risk throughout the financial system. These complex instruments:
- Obscured the true level of risk
- Created perverse incentives where originators of loans had little stake in their performance
- Led to a "originate-to-distribute" model that prioritized volume over quality

## Credit Rating Agency Failures

Major credit rating agencies (Moody's, S&P, Fitch) gave AAA ratings to many mortgage-backed securities that later proved to be highly risky. This occurred due to:
- Conflicts of interest (agencies were paid by issuers)
- Inadequate risk assessment models
- Competitive pressure to provide favorable ratings

## Excessive Leverage and Risk-Taking

Financial institutions took on unprecedented levels of debt relative to their capital:
- Major investment banks had leverage ratios of 30:1 or higher
- Banks relied heavily on short-term funding markets
- Risk management systems failed to account for systemic risks

## Global Interconnectedness

The crisis spread rapidly due to:
- International banks' exposure to U.S. mortgage securities
- Complex counterparty relationships
- Globalized financial markets that transmitted shocks across borders

## Government Policy Factors

Several policy decisions contributed to the crisis:
- Low interest rates maintained by the Federal Reserve (2001-2004)
- Government-sponsored enterprises (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac) purchasing large quantities of mortgages
- Political pressure to increase homeownership rates

## The Collapse

When housing prices began declining in 2006-2007, the overleveraged system quickly unraveled:
- Massive losses on mortgage-related investments
- Credit markets froze as trust evaporated
- Major financial institutions failed or required bailouts
- The crisis spread from financial markets to the broader economy

The 2008 financial crisis demonstrated how interconnected risks, regulatory gaps, and misaligned incentives could create systemic vulnerabilities that threatened the entire global financial system. Its effects included the Great Recession, millions of foreclosures, massive unemployment, and required unprecedented government intervention to stabilize markets.
