# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

The 2008 financial crisis resulted from a complex interplay of factors that created a perfect storm in the global financial system. Here are the key causes:

## Housing Market Bubble and Subprime Mortgages

The crisis originated in the U.S. housing market, where a massive bubble had formed due to:
- **Relaxed lending standards**: Banks issued "subprime" mortgages to borrowers with poor credit histories or insufficient income
- **Predatory lending practices**: Including adjustable-rate mortgages with low initial "teaser" rates that later increased dramatically
- **Government policies**: Encouraged homeownership through programs that pushed banks to lend to lower-income borrowers
- **Belief in ever-rising home prices**: Created false confidence that mortgage defaults wouldn't be catastrophic

## Financial Innovation and Risk Concealment

Wall Street developed complex financial instruments that spread and amplified risk:
- **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)**: Bundled mortgages were sold to investors worldwide
- **Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)**: Even more complex securities that repackaged mortgage debt
- **Credit default swaps**: Insurance-like products that allowed betting on mortgage failures without proper reserves
- **Securitization**: Allowed banks to originate loans and immediately sell the risk, reducing their incentive for careful underwriting

## Regulatory Failures

Multiple regulatory shortcomings contributed to the crisis:
- **Deregulation**: Key legislation like the Glass-Steagall Act was repealed, allowing commercial and investment banking to merge
- **Oversight gaps**: Regulators failed to monitor the growing "shadow banking" system
- **Capital requirements**: Banks weren't required to hold sufficient reserves against potential losses
- **Rating agencies**: Credit rating companies gave overly optimistic ratings to risky securities, creating conflicts of interest

## Global Interconnectedness

The crisis spread rapidly due to:
- **International investment**: Foreign banks and institutions heavily invested in U.S. mortgage securities
- **Counterparty risk**: Major financial institutions were deeply interconnected through derivatives and lending
- **Confidence collapse**: When trust evaporated, credit markets froze globally

## Excessive Leverage and Risk-Taking

Financial institutions took on dangerous levels of debt:
- **High leverage ratios**: Some investment banks had debt-to-equity ratios exceeding 30:1
- **"Too big to fail" mentality**: Large institutions took excessive risks, believing government bailouts were guaranteed
- **Compensation structures**: Rewarded short-term profits over long-term stability

The crisis began when housing prices started falling in 2006-2007, triggering massive defaults on subprime mortgages. This caused the complex securities built on these mortgages to lose value rapidly, leading to bank failures, credit market freezes, and ultimately a global recession. The interconnected nature of modern finance meant that problems in one sector quickly spread throughout the entire global economy.
