# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

The 2008 financial crisis, also known as the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), was caused by a complex interplay of factors that created systemic vulnerabilities in the global financial system. The crisis had multiple interconnected causes that can be categorized into several key areas.

## Housing Market Bubble and Subprime Mortgages

The crisis originated primarily in the U.S. housing market, where a massive bubble had formed during the early 2000s [1]. Banks and other lenders began issuing subprime mortgages to borrowers with poor credit histories or insufficient income to qualify for conventional loans [2]. These high-risk loans were often structured with adjustable rates that started low but increased significantly over time, making them unaffordable for many borrowers when rates reset [3].

Government policies also contributed to the housing bubble. The Community Reinvestment Act and pressure from government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac encouraged lending to lower-income borrowers [4]. Additionally, historically low interest rates maintained by the Federal Reserve from 2001-2004 made borrowing cheaper and fueled speculative investment in real estate [5].

## Financial Innovation and Risk Mismanagement

The widespread use of complex financial instruments significantly amplified the crisis. Banks packaged mortgages into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which were then sold to investors worldwide [6]. This securitization process allowed banks to transfer risk off their balance sheets while continuing to originate more loans, creating a dangerous cycle of increased lending without accountability [7].

Credit default swaps (CDS), essentially insurance contracts on debt securities, grew into a massive unregulated market worth over $60 trillion by 2007 [8]. These derivatives created additional systemic risk as financial institutions became interconnected through complex webs of obligations.

## Regulatory Failures and Deregulation

Regulatory oversight failed to keep pace with financial innovation. The repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999 allowed commercial and investment banking activities to merge, creating larger, more complex financial institutions that were "too big to fail" [9]. Banking regulators failed to adequately supervise the growing shadow banking system, which included investment banks, money market funds, and other non-bank financial institutions [10].

Credit rating agencies (Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch) played a crucial role by giving AAA ratings to securities that later proved to be highly risky [11]. These agencies faced conflicts of interest as they were paid by the issuers of the securities they rated, creating incentives to provide favorable ratings [12].

## Global Interconnectedness and Contagion

The crisis spread rapidly due to the interconnected nature of global financial markets. European banks had heavily invested in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, while American financial institutions had significant exposure to European markets [13]. When housing prices began falling in 2006-2007, the losses cascaded through the global financial system.

## The Crisis Unfolds

The crisis reached a tipping point in 2007 when major financial institutions began reporting massive losses. Bear Stearns collapsed in March 2008, followed by the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 [14]. The collapse of these major institutions created panic in financial markets, leading to a credit freeze that threatened the entire global economy [15].

The crisis required unprecedented government intervention, including bank bailouts, stimulus packages, and emergency lending facilities by central banks worldwide [16]. The economic impact was severe, resulting in the worst recession since the Great Depression, with millions of jobs lost and trillions of dollars in wealth destroyed [17].
