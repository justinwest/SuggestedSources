# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

The 2008 financial crisis resulted from a complex web of interconnected factors that created a perfect storm in the global financial system. Here are the primary causes:

## Housing Bubble and Subprime Mortgages

The crisis originated in the U.S. housing market, where home prices had been rising rapidly since the early 2000s. Financial institutions began issuing "subprime" mortgages to borrowers with poor credit histories or insufficient income documentation. These loans often featured adjustable rates that started low but increased significantly over time, making them unaffordable for many borrowers.

## Deregulation and Regulatory Failures

Key deregulatory measures weakened oversight of financial institutions:
- The repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999 allowed commercial and investment banking to merge
- Relaxed lending standards enabled predatory lending practices
- Inadequate regulation of derivatives markets allowed risky financial instruments to proliferate
- Regulatory agencies failed to monitor emerging risks effectively

## Securitization and Complex Financial Instruments

Banks packaged mortgages into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), then sold them to investors worldwide. This process:
- Spread risk throughout the global financial system
- Obscured the true quality of underlying loans
- Created perverse incentives where loan originators bore little risk for defaults
- Generated enormous profits for financial institutions in the short term

## Excessive Leverage and Risk-Taking

Major financial institutions operated with extremely high leverage ratios, meaning they borrowed heavily to amplify their investments. When housing prices began falling, these highly leveraged institutions faced catastrophic losses that exceeded their capital reserves.

## Credit Rating Agencies' Failures

Rating agencies like Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch assigned AAA ratings to many mortgage-backed securities that later proved worthless. These agencies faced conflicts of interest, as they were paid by the issuers of the securities they rated.

## Global Interconnectedness

The crisis spread rapidly worldwide because:
- International banks had purchased large quantities of U.S. mortgage securities
- Global financial markets were deeply interconnected
- Credit markets froze as trust between institutions evaporated
- The shadow banking system amplified the crisis through money market funds and other non-bank financial entities

## Monetary Policy Factors

Some economists argue that the Federal Reserve's low interest rate policy from 2001-2004 contributed to the housing bubble by making borrowing cheaper and encouraging risk-taking in search of higher yields.

The crisis ultimately required massive government interventions, including bank bailouts, stimulus packages, and unprecedented monetary policy measures to prevent a complete collapse of the financial system. The resulting recession was the worst since the Great Depression, with effects lasting years and fundamentally changing how financial markets operate and are regulated.
