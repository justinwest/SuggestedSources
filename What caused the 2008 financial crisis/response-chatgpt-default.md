# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

The 2008 financial crisis was the result of a chain reaction in which macroeconomic forces, distorted incentives, regulatory failures, and complex financial innovations interacted to create a highly fragile global financial system. The main elements can be grouped into five inter-locking categories:

1. Macroeconomic backdrop  
• Low interest rates and abundant global liquidity: After the 2001 dot-com bust and the September 11 attacks, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut short-term rates to historic lows. Simultaneously, a “global savings glut” (large current-account surpluses in China, oil-exporting nations, and other emerging markets) poured capital into U.S. fixed-income assets, pushing long-term rates down.  
• Search for yield: Institutional investors faced low returns on traditional safe assets and eagerly sought higher-yielding products that still appeared to be low-risk.  
• U.S. housing boom: Cheap financing and tax incentives for homeownership, together with speculative buying, drove house prices far above underlying fundamentals from roughly 2002 to 2006.

2. Lax lending standards and the housing bubble  
• Subprime and “Alt-A” mortgages: Lenders aggressively extended loans to borrowers with poor credit histories, little documentation, or no down payment, often using adjustable-rate or “teaser” loans whose payments would jump after a short period.  
• Originate-to-distribute model: Because lenders could quickly sell newly originated mortgages to Wall Street for securitization, they had little incentive to scrutinize borrowers.  
• Predatory or misleading practices: Some mortgage brokers falsified income, misrepresented terms, or steered borrowers into inappropriately costly products.  
• Ballooning leverage for households: U.S. household debt rose from roughly 100 % to 130 % of disposable income in the decade before the crisis, amplifying vulnerability when house prices stopped rising.

3. Securitization, derivatives, and excessive leverage in the financial sector  
• Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs): Banks bundled mortgages into bonds, then re-bundled lower-rated slices (mezzanine tranches) into new CDOs. This multiplied exposure to the same underlying mortgages and obscured the true risk.  
• Reliance on credit ratings: Rating agencies routinely assigned AAA ratings to senior tranches of MBS and CDOs, enabling institutions to hold them under “safe asset” capital requirements.  
• Credit default swaps (CDS): Firms such as AIG wrote vast volumes of CDS—insurance-like contracts—without posting adequate collateral, creating hidden interconnected exposures.  
• Shadow banking and short-term funding: Investment banks and special-purpose vehicles financed long-term mortgage assets in overnight repo and commercial-paper markets. When confidence fell, lenders refused to roll this funding, triggering runs analogous to bank runs.  
• High leverage: Some investment banks’ balance-sheet leverage exceeded 30-to-1; thin equity bases meant that even small declines in asset values threatened insolvency.

4. Regulatory and governance failures  
• Fragmented oversight: U.S. financial regulation was split among numerous agencies (Fed, OCC, OTS, SEC, FDIC, state regulators), leaving gaps—particularly over investment banks, shadow banking entities, and derivatives.  
• Capital rules that encouraged securitization: Basel I risk weights let banks hold less capital against AAA-rated securities than against whole mortgages, incentivizing securitization and ratings arbitrage.  
• Repeal of Glass-Steagall and voluntary SEC leverage rules: Allowing investment banks broader activities and self-regulated leverage increased systemic vulnerability.  
• Inadequate consumer protection: Agencies focused on banking soundness paid limited attention to abusive mortgage lending practices.  
• Executive compensation: Short-term, transaction-based pay encouraged risk-taking without regard to long-run consequences.

5. The unraveling (2006–2008)  
• Housing bust: U.S. house prices peaked in mid-2006. Refinancing dried up, subprime delinquencies spiked in 2006–07, and the value of MBS started to fall.  
• Early tremors: In June 2007 two Bear Stearns hedge funds collapsed; in August 2007 BNP Paribas froze three funds, prompting the European Central Bank and Fed to inject liquidity.  
• Contagion to financial institutions: As losses spread, repo lenders demanded more collateral, investors pulled out of asset-backed commercial paper, and banks hoarded liquidity.  
• March 2008: Bear Stearns avoided bankruptcy only through a Fed-backed takeover by JPMorgan Chase.  
• September 2008:  
  – The U.S. Treasury placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship.  
  – Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on September 15, setting off global panic.  
  – AIG required a massive Fed rescue to meet collateral calls on CDS.  
  – Money-market funds “broke the buck,” prompting a run on these crucial cash-management vehicles.  
• Freezing of credit: Interbank lending rates spiked; trade finance, corporate commercial-paper issuance, and consumer credit contracted sharply.  
• Global recession: The shock cascaded worldwide, shrinking output, plunging trade, and causing mass layoffs and fiscal crises in multiple countries.

Interplay and feedback loops  
The crisis was not attributable to one single factor but to mutually reinforcing mechanisms: accommodative monetary conditions bred a housing bubble; securitization transferred and obscured risk; leverage amplified losses; lax regulation allowed systemic fragilities to build; and once housing turned, confidence evaporated, causing a classic run on the shadow banking system that spilled over to the real economy.

In short, the 2008 crisis emerged from the convergence of a housing-price collapse, massive mispricing of risk in complex mortgage securities, excessive leverage, regulatory blind spots, and interconnections that transmitted losses rapidly throughout the global financial system.
