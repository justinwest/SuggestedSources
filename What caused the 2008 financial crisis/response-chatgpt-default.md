# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

Causes of the 2008 financial crisis  

1. Macroeconomic backdrop  
   a. “Global savings glut.” Large current-account surpluses in Asia and the oil-exporting countries were recycled into U.S. dollar assets, pushing long-term interest rates down and encouraging risk-taking in the United States [1].  
   b. Extremely low short-term rates. After the 2001 recession the Federal Reserve kept the federal-funds rate at or below 2 % for three years, making credit unusually cheap and fueling a search for yield [2].

2. U.S. housing boom and subprime lending  
   a. Rapid house-price appreciation (1997-2006) lulled lenders and borrowers into believing home values could only rise.  
   b. Lax underwriting: “no-doc” and “option-ARM” loans were extended to millions of subprime or Alt-A borrowers whose repayment ability depended on further price gains [3].  
   c. Public and private policies encouraged home-ownership, from the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to the Community Reinvestment Act and aggressive non-bank mortgage brokers [4].

3. Originate-to-distribute securitization  
   a. Mortgages were pooled into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and then into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Because originators no longer kept loans on their own balance sheets, they had little incentive to enforce prudent standards [5].  
   b. Complexity meant that purchasers—pension funds, insurance companies, money-market funds—relied heavily on external credit ratings.

4. Credit-rating agency failures  
   Rating agencies earned lucrative fees from structuring deals and routinely stamped senior tranches AAA, grossly underestimating correlated housing risk [6].

5. Excess leverage and the shadow-banking system  
   a. Investment banks operated at 30-to-1 leverage, funding long-term assets with overnight repurchase (repo) agreements that were vulnerable to runs [7].  
   b. Money-market funds, structured investment vehicles (SIVs), and securities lenders performed bank-like maturity transformation without deposit insurance or a lender of last resort.

6. Deregulation and regulatory gaps  
   a. The 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act removed the Glass–Steagall barrier between commercial and investment banking, allowing ever larger, more complex financial conglomerates [8].  
   b. The 2000 Commodity Futures Modernization Act effectively exempted most over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives—including credit-default swaps (CDS)—from regulation, capital requirements, or transparency [9].  
   c. No single regulator oversaw the entire shadow-banking chain; mortgage brokers, rating agencies, and investment banks exploited the gaps.

7. Credit-default swaps and counterparty risk  
   CDS were used both to hedge and to speculate. When the underlying bonds faltered, sellers such as AIG lacked the collateral to honor payouts, threatening domino-like losses across the system [10].

8. Risk-management and governance failures  
   Internal models assumed nationwide housing prices would not fall. Boards and senior managers often failed to understand the securities they owned or the liquidity risk of their funding [1].

9. Trigger events and contagion  
   • 2006-07: U.S. house prices peak and subprime delinquencies surge.  
   • Aug 2007: BNP Paribas freezes three funds, exposing the inability to value MBS.  
   • Mar 2008: Bear Stearns collapses after a repo run.  
   • Sep 2008: Lehman Brothers files for bankruptcy; money-market funds “break the buck,” interbank lending freezes, and global trade finance stalls.  
   Because institutions were densely interconnected through repos and derivatives, fear of unknown counterparty losses produced a generalized run on the shadow-banking system [7].

10. Summation  
The crisis was not the product of a single mistake but of interacting vulnerabilities: a global credit glut and ultra-low rates, a housing bubble financed by ever riskier mortgages, securitization that diffused accountability, inflated credit ratings, massive leverage, unregulated derivatives, and fragmented oversight. Once U.S. house prices turned, losses cascaded through an opaque, highly levered system, culminating in a worldwide liquidity and confidence collapse.
