# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

1. Housing-price boom and bust  
   • From the late 1990s to 2006 U.S. home prices roughly doubled, outpacing incomes and rents.  
   • Drivers: low interest rates after the 2001 recession, capital inflows from export-surplus countries, federal tax incentives for home ownership, and an industry belief that nationwide housing prices “never fall.”  
   • When price growth slowed in 2006-07, highly leveraged borrowers began to default, starting a chain reaction through the financial system.

2. Explosion of subprime and other high-risk mortgages  
   • Lenders increasingly originated loans to borrowers with weak credit, little documentation (“Alt-A,” “liar loans”), or teaser rates that reset sharply higher.  
   • Underwriting standards deteriorated because lenders immediately sold the loans, shifting credit risk away from themselves.  
   • Predatory sales practices and borrower speculation added fuel.

3. Securitization and faulty credit ratings  
   • Banks pooled mortgages into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and, in a second step, into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).  
   • Rating agencies paid by issuers stamped many tranches AAA, underestimating the correlation of defaults and relying on limited historical data that did not include a nationwide price decline.  
   • Investors worldwide—pension funds, insurers, money-market funds—bought the securities believing they were nearly risk-free.

4. Excess leverage and the shadow-banking system  
   • Investment banks, hedge funds, structured investment vehicles (SIVs), and money-market funds funded long-term assets with cheap, short-term wholesale funding such as repurchase (repo) agreements and commercial paper.  
   • Leverage ratios at major broker-dealers exceeded 30:1; a small decline in asset values wiped out capital.  
   • Because these entities were outside traditional deposit insurance and capital regulations, they were prone to runs.

5. Derivatives and counterparty risk  
   • Credit-default swaps (CDS) allowed speculators and insurers (notably AIG) to sell protection on MBS and CDO tranches without setting aside capital.  
   • When defaults mounted, protection sellers faced huge collateral calls, creating systemic risk because the market was opaque and unregulated.

6. Regulatory and supervisory failures  
   • Key post-Depression firewalls had been weakened (e.g., the 1999 repeal of parts of Glass-Steagall).  
   • The SEC in 2004 let major broker-dealers choose their own risk models and cut required capital cushions.  
   • No federal agency oversaw mortgage brokers; the Fed did not use its authority to curb abusive lending under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act.  
   • Fragmented regulation left gaps between banking, securities, insurance, and derivatives oversight.

7. Incentive misalignment across the chain  
   • Mortgage brokers earned fees on volume, not loan performance.  
   • Structured-product desks earned bonuses on deal flow and modeled risk, not realized losses.  
   • Rating-agency analysts were paid by issuers.  
   • Senior managers relied on short-term stock options; shareholders benefited from upside but had limited liability on downside.

8. Global imbalances and the hunt for yield  
   • High-saving emerging markets (China, oil exporters) and Germany/Japan ran large current-account surpluses and invested in U.S. fixed-income assets, pushing down yields.  
   • Investors ventured into complex structured products to earn a few extra basis points, amplifying demand for risky mortgages.

9. Monetary policy backdrop  
   • The Federal Reserve kept the federal-funds rate very low (1% in 2003-04) to counter the 2001 tech-bust recession and deflation fears, encouraging borrowing.  
   • While not the sole cause, cheap money made credit-fueled asset bubbles easier to form.

10. Immediate trigger events (2007-08)  
   • Feb-Apr 2007: subprime lender New Century collapses; several hedge funds at Bear Stearns fail.  
   • Summer 2007: interbank lending strains appear; BNP Paribas freezes three funds, marking the “first freeze” of liquidity.  
   • Mar 2008: Bear Stearns rescued by JPMorgan with Fed support.  
   • Sept 2008:  
     – Sept 7: U.S. government takes Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship.  
     – Sept 15: Lehman Brothers files for bankruptcy, shattering confidence in all short-term funding markets.  
     – Sept 16: AIG rescued; Reserve Primary money-market fund “breaks the buck,” triggering wholesale runs.  
   • Without functioning credit markets, real-economy firms could not roll over working capital, forcing extraordinary central-bank and fiscal interventions.

Interaction of factors  
   — A housing bubble provided the combustible material.  
   — Securitization and derivatives spread that risk across highly leveraged institutions worldwide.  
   — Poor regulation, flawed models, and misaligned incentives let fragilities accumulate out of sight.  
   — Once house prices reversed, losses cascaded through interconnected balance sheets; liquidity evaporated, turning a credit correction into a systemic crisis.

In short, the 2008 financial crisis was not caused by a single event but by the convergence of a housing bubble, lax lending, complex and misunderstood financial engineering, excessive leverage, regulatory gaps, and macroeconomic forces that together produced a sudden loss of confidence and a worldwide credit freeze.
