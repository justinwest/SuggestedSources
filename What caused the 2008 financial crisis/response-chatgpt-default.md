# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

SUMMARY  
The 2008 financial crisis did not have a single cause; it was the product of mutually reinforcing economic, institutional, and psychological factors that built up over roughly a decade. At its core, the crisis reflected an unsustainable boom in housing-related credit, a fragile and highly leveraged financial system, and regulatory and market failures that allowed risks to migrate, concentrate, and finally detonate.  

Below is a structured explanation of the main causal layers, how they interacted, and the sequence of events that turned long-standing vulnerabilities into a full-blown global panic.

────────────────────
1. MACRO BACKDROP: EASY MONEY AND GLOBAL IMBALANCES
────────────────────
• Post-2001 recession policy: After the dot-com bust and 9/11, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its policy rate from 6.5 % (2000) to 1 % (2003–04). Real mortgage rates fell even further.  
• “Global savings glut”: Rapidly growing export economies (notably China, oil producers, and Germany) invested their surpluses in U.S. Treasuries and agency securities, pushing long-term yields lower.  
• Result: Cheap funding worldwide, pressure to “search for yield,” and abundant capital for U.S. housing finance.

────────────────────
2. THE HOUSING BUBBLE
────────────────────
• Price surge: U.S. home prices roughly doubled in nominal terms from 1998 to mid-2006, far outpacing incomes and rents.  
• Psychology: Widespread belief that nationwide home prices “never fall,” reinforcing speculative buying and refinancing.  
• Political push: Bipartisan support for expanding homeownership, combined with aggressive goals at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, added demand for mortgage credit.

────────────────────
3. DETERIORATING LENDING STANDARDS
────────────────────
• Subprime and Alt-A: Lenders issued mortgages to borrowers with weaker credit, little documentation (“liar loans”), or very small/no down payments.  
• Teaser structures: Many loans had low initial “2/28” or “3/27” rates that reset sharply higher later.  
• Incentive problem—“originate-to-distribute”: Mortgage brokers earned fees for volume, not loan performance, so they pushed risky loans knowing they would be sold to investors.

────────────────────
4. SECURITIZATION, COMPLEX PRODUCTS, AND SHADOW BANKING
────────────────────
• Mortgage-backed securities (MBS): Pools of mortgages were sliced into tranches with different risk profiles.  
• Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs): Lower-rated MBS tranches were repackaged again, magnifying leverage and obscuring exposure.  
• Credit default swaps (CDS): Investors could take synthetic exposure without owning the underlying loans, further expanding effective supply of subprime risk.  
• Shadow banking: Investment banks, SIVs, money-market funds, and repo markets financed long-term assets with short-term borrowing, outside traditional bank regulation.

────────────────────
5. FAILURES OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND MARKET DISCIPLINE
────────────────────
• Excessive leverage: Large broker-dealers levered 25–40× equity; commercial banks used off-balance-sheet vehicles to avoid capital rules.  
• Mispriced risk: Historical data were too short to capture national housing declines; models assumed diversification that proved illusory.  
• Over-reliance on credit ratings: AAA labels on senior tranches obscured true risk; agencies were paid by issuers, creating conflicts.  
• Compensation incentives: Bonus structures rewarded short-term profits, not long-term loan performance.

────────────────────
6. REGULATORY AND SUPERVISORY GAPS
────────────────────
• Fragmented oversight: Multiple U.S. regulators (Fed, OCC, OTS, SEC, state agencies) produced gaps and “regulatory shopping.”  
• Basel I/II capital rules: Treated AAA mortgage securities as low-risk, encouraging banks to hold them.  
• Derivatives largely unregulated: CDS markets lacked central clearing, creating opaque counterparty exposures.  
• No lender-of-last-resort for shadow banking: Entities reliant on repo and commercial paper had no explicit backstop.

────────────────────
7. THE UNWIND
────────────────────
1. 2006–07: Housing prices peaked; subprime delinquencies rose; ABX indices (synthetic MBS prices) fell.  
2. Mid-2007: Two Bear Stearns hedge funds collapsed; BNP Paribas froze three funds, triggering a broader liquidity freeze in asset-backed commercial paper.  
3. Late 2007–early 2008: Banks faced mounting write-downs. The Fed introduced the Term Auction Facility and cut rates sharply.  
4. March 2008: Bear Stearns ran out of repo funding and was sold to JPMorgan with Fed assistance.  
5. Summer 2008: Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac placed into conservatorship; IndyMac and other regional lenders failed.  
6. September 2008 (catalyst):  
   • Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy (Sept 15).  
   • AIG required an $85 bn Fed rescue due to CDS collateral calls.  
   • Reserve Primary money-market fund “broke the buck,” sparking a run on prime funds.  
   • Interbank lending froze; LIBOR-OIS spreads spiked.  
7. Systemic panic: Global trade finance stopped, equity markets plunged, and real-economy layoffs accelerated.

────────────────────
8. FEEDBACK LOOPS AND CONTAGION
────────────────────
• Fire sales: Falling asset prices triggered margin calls, forcing more sales and further price drops.  
• Collateral chains broke: Repo lenders marked down collateral, reducing funding and accelerating deleveraging.  
• Confidence shock: Uncertainty over who held what exposures led to generalized counterparty distrust.  
• Credit crunch: Banks tightened lending to households and firms, deepening the recession, which in turn worsened credit losses.

────────────────────
9. WHY IT BECAME GLOBAL
────────────────────
• Foreign banks had loaded up on U.S. MBS and relied on dollar wholesale funding (e.g., in Europe).  
• Dollar shortage: Non-U.S. institutions scrambled for dollars; the Fed opened massive swap lines.  
• Trade collapse: Tight credit and plunging demand cut world trade by ~20 % peak-to-trough.

────────────────────
10. GOVERNMENT RESPONSES (brief context)
────────────────────
• U.S.: TARP ($700 bn capital injections), FDIC guarantees, Fed lending facilities, zero interest rates, and successive rounds of quantitative easing.  
• International: Coordinated rate cuts, bank recapitalizations, stimulus packages, and Basel III reforms.  
(These responses mitigated but did not cause the crisis; they are included for completeness.)

CORE TAKEAWAY
────────────────────
The 2008 crisis was the culmination of (1) a debt-fueled housing bubble, (2) lax lending and opaque securitization that dispersed and disguised credit risk, (3) excessive leverage and maturity transformation in a lightly regulated shadow-bank network, and (4) a failure of both market discipline and supervisory oversight. When housing prices turned, the structure—dependent on ever-rising collateral values and continuous short-term funding—collapsed, producing cascading losses, a global liquidity freeze, and the deepest recession since the 1930s.
