# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

The 2008 financial crisis was the outcome of a chain of interacting forces that built up over roughly a decade.  At the most basic level, too much debt was piled on top of a highly levered, opaque, and globally interconnected financial system, all resting on the incorrect assumption that U.S. house prices would not fall nationwide.  Below is a structured overview of the principal causes, showing how the pressures accumulated, how the shock was transmitted, and why the system failed to contain it.

1. Macroeconomic backdrop  
   • Global savings-glut:  Large current-account surpluses in emerging Asia and oil-exporting nations were recycled into U.S. dollar assets, pushing down long-term rates and fueling a search for yield.  
   • Loose monetary policy:  After the 2001 dot-com bust and 9/11, the Federal Reserve kept short-term rates very low.  Cheap credit encouraged borrowing, especially in housing.  
   • Great Moderation mindset:  Two decades of relatively mild recessions and low inflation bred complacency among policymakers and market participants about systemic risk.

2. U.S. housing boom and bust  
   • Surge in home prices (1997-2006) created widespread belief that housing was a one-way bet.  
   • Home-equity extraction:  Rising values let households refinance and spend, masking stagnant real wages.  
   • Overbuilding:  Construction and related industries became unusually large relative to GDP.  
   • When prices peaked in 2006 and began falling, negative equity spread quickly.

3. Subprime and exotic mortgage lending  
   • Dramatic easing of underwriting standards:  low- or no-documentation “liar loans,” 2/28 adjustable-rate mortgages, teaser rates, and zero down-payments.  
   • Financial incentives:  Originators earned fees for volume, not loan performance, because loans were almost immediately sold into securitization chains.  
   • Regulatory arbitrage:  Non-bank “shadow” lenders were lightly supervised compared with traditional banks.

4. Securitization machinery  
   • Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) bundled thousands of loans; Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) re-repackaged lower-rated tranches into ostensibly high-grade bonds.  
   • An “originate-to-distribute” model decoupled loan creation from credit risk, weakening discipline.  
   • Opaque structures and thin “equity” tranches meant small losses could wipe out whole deals.  
   • Reliance on flawed quantitative models (e.g., Gaussian copula) and short historical data underestimated correlated default risk.

5. Leverage and risk concentration  
   • Investment banks allowed balance-sheet leverage of 30-40×; hedge funds and SIVs borrowed short-term in repo or commercial paper markets.  
   • “Monoline” insurers and AIG Financial Products sold vast amounts of credit-default-swap (CDS) protection without adequate capital.  
   • Off-balance-sheet vehicles let commercial banks hold risky assets while appearing well-capitalized.

6. Credit-rating agency failures  
   • Over-reliance on ratings for regulatory and portfolio mandates made AAA tranches integral to demand.  
   • Agencies faced conflicts of interest (issuer-pays model) and used flawed assumptions, giving complex MBS and CDOs artificially high ratings.  
   • Investors (money-market funds, pension funds, insurers) substituted ratings for due diligence.

7. Supervisory and regulatory gaps  
   • Fragmented U.S. oversight:  no single authority saw the entire mortgage-origination-to-CDO pipeline.  
   • Basel I/II capital rules encouraged movement of assets to lightly regulated entities and favored AAA securities.  
   • Derivatives such as CDS were traded over-the-counter and largely unregulated.  
   • Inadequate consumer-protection enforcement allowed abusive lending practices to proliferate.

8. Immediate triggers and propagation  
   • 2006-07: Subprime delinquencies rise; ABX index signals falling prices of subprime bonds.  
   • Summer 2007: Two Bear Stearns hedge funds collapse; BNP Paribas freezes MBS funds, sparking liquidity stress in Europe and the U.S.  
   • 2007-08: Wholesale funding markets (asset-backed commercial paper, repo) tighten; banks hoard cash; interbank rates spike.  
   • March 2008: Bear Stearns rescued and sold to JPMorgan Chase with Fed support.  
   • September 2008: U.S. Treasury places Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship; Lehman Brothers files for bankruptcy; AIG rescued; money-market fund (Reserve Primary) “breaks the buck.”  
   • Global contagion:  Freezing of credit markets, collapse of cross-border dollar funding, sharp falls in trade and industrial output.

9. Feedback loops that deepened the crisis  
   • Fire-sales:  Falling asset prices caused mark-to-market losses, forcing more deleveraging.  
   • Collateral calls on CDS and repo lines drained liquidity.  
   • Real-economy impact:  Credit contraction curtailed business investment and consumer spending, intensifying job losses and defaults—feeding back into bank balance sheets.

10. Why the system could not absorb the shock  
   • Thin capital cushions and pro-cyclical accounting left institutions little room for error.  
   • Complexity and opacity made counterparties distrustful, paralyzing funding markets.  
   • Lack of a clear resolution regime for large, non-bank financial firms meant policymakers faced a stark choice between bailout and collapse.  
   • Globally synchronized exposure ensured that adverse shocks reverberated across borders almost instantly.

In sum, the 2008 financial crisis was not the result of a single event but of a multiyear accumulation of excesses—cheap global money, lax regulation, aggressive financial engineering, and a speculative housing bubble—interlinked through highly leveraged and opaque markets.  When U.S. home prices fell and subprime defaults rose, the weaknesses were exposed, confidence evaporated, and the intricate web of debt and derivatives quickly unraveled, triggering the worst financial meltdown since the Great Depression.
