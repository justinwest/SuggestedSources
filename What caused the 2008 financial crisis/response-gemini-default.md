# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

Of course. Here is a comprehensive overview of the causes of the 2008 financial crisis.

***

The 2008 financial crisis was the most severe global economic downturn since the Great Depression. It was not caused by a single event but by a confluence of interconnected factors that created a "perfect storm" of systemic risk. The collapse was rooted in the U.S. housing market but quickly spread through the global financial system. The key causes can be broken down as follows:

### 1. The U.S. Housing Bubble

In the early 2000s, a massive bubble formed in the U.S. housing market. This was driven by several forces:

*   **Low-Interest Rates:** Following the dot-com bust and the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. Federal Reserve, under Chairman Alan Greenspan, lowered the federal funds rate to a historic low of 1% by 2003. This made borrowing money extremely cheap for both consumers and banks, fueling a surge in mortgage lending and home buying that pushed prices to unsustainable levels [1].
*   **Global Capital Imbalances:** A "global savings glut," particularly from fast-growing Asian economies and oil-exporting nations, flooded the U.S. with foreign capital. This money sought safe, higher-yield investments, and the U.S. mortgage market seemed to be the perfect destination, further driving down lending standards [2].

### 2. Subprime Mortgages and Predatory Lending

As the housing market boomed, mortgage lenders began to exhaust the pool of creditworthy ("prime") borrowers. To continue generating profits, they turned to subprime lending—issuing mortgages to borrowers with poor credit histories and a higher risk of default.

These loans often featured predatory terms, such as low initial "teaser" rates that would later reset to much higher variable rates, making them unaffordable for borrowers down the line. The prevailing belief was that since housing prices were constantly rising, borrowers could simply refinance or sell their homes at a profit if they ran into trouble [3]. This created a system where lenders issued loans with little to no concern for the borrower's long-term ability to pay.

### 3. Securitization and Complex Financial Products

The risk from these subprime mortgages was not contained within the banks that issued them. Instead, it was packaged and sold to investors around the globe through a process called **securitization**.

*   **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS):** Investment banks would buy thousands of individual mortgages (both prime and subprime) and bundle them together to create a new financial product called a Mortgage-Backed Security. Investors who bought an MBS would receive payments as homeowners paid their mortgages.
*   **Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs):** The process became even more complex. Banks took the riskiest parts of different MBS and bundled them *again* into a new, even more complex product called a Collateralized Debt Obligation. These CDOs were sliced into different risk levels, or "tranches." The safest, top tranches were promised to be paid first, while the riskiest, bottom tranches would absorb any initial losses [4].

This system diffused risk so widely that no one was entirely sure where the underlying bad loans were. It also created a moral hazard: the original lenders had no incentive to ensure the quality of their loans because they could quickly sell them off to investment banks, passing the risk on to someone else.

### 4. Failures of Credit Rating Agencies

Credit rating agencies like Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch were supposed to act as independent watchdogs, assessing the risk of these complex financial products. However, they gave the highest possible rating (AAA, indicating extreme safety) to a vast number of risky CDOs and other mortgage-related securities.

This happened for two main reasons:
1.  **Conflict of Interest:** The rating agencies were paid by the very investment banks whose products they were rating, creating a huge incentive to issue favorable ratings to win business [5].
2.  **Flawed Models:** Their risk assessment models were based on historical data that did not account for the possibility of a nationwide decline in housing prices. They assumed mortgage defaults were isolated events and would not happen all at once across the country [4].

These AAA ratings gave investors, from pension funds to international banks, a false sense of security, leading them to pour trillions of dollars into what were ultimately toxic assets.

### 5. Deregulation and Lack of Oversight

A decades-long trend of financial deregulation created an environment where risk-taking could flourish without adequate checks and balances.

*   **Repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act:** In 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act effectively repealed parts of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. This removed the wall separating commercial banks (which take deposits) and investment banks (which trade securities), allowing them to merge. This contributed to the creation of financial institutions that were "too big to fail" and took on excessive risk [2].
*   **Unregulated Derivatives:** The market for derivatives—financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset—had exploded but remained largely unregulated. A key example is the **Credit Default Swap (CDS)**. A CDS is essentially an insurance policy on a debt product. Institutions like American International Group (AIG) sold tens of billions of dollars worth of CDSs, insuring the CDOs that were full of subprime mortgages. When those CDOs failed, AIG did not have the capital to pay out on its insurance promises, requiring a massive government bailout to prevent a chain reaction of collapse [6].

### The Unraveling (2007-2008)

By 2006, the housing bubble had peaked. Interest rates rose and teaser rates on subprime mortgages began to reset. Homeowners found themselves unable to make their higher payments, and with housing prices now falling, they could not sell or refinance. Defaults skyrocketed.

This caused the value of MBS and CDOs to plummet. Financial institutions holding these assets saw their balance sheets decimated. Because the system was so interconnected and opaque, banks became terrified to lend to one another, not knowing who was exposed to toxic assets. This caused a credit crunch that froze the entire financial system.

Key moments in the collapse include the government-brokered sale of Bear Stearns in March 2008, the federal takeover of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in early September 2008, and the pivotal event: the bankruptcy of **Lehman Brothers** on September 15, 2008. The government's decision to let Lehman fail sent shockwaves through the global markets, signaling that no institution was safe and triggering a full-blown panic [7]. The subsequent $182 billion bailout of AIG was necessary to prevent the collapse of its many counterparties around the world.

In conclusion, the 2008 financial crisis was the result of a chain of failures, from irresponsible lending at the ground level to systemic flaws in the most sophisticated corners of global finance, all compounded by a regulatory framework that failed to keep pace with financial innovation.
