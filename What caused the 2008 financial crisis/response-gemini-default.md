# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

The 2008 financial crisis was not caused by a single event, but by a complex interplay of factors that created a systemic vulnerability. At its core, it was a crisis that began in the U.S. housing market and, through a series of interconnected financial innovations, spiraled into a global credit freeze that brought the world's financial system to the brink of collapse.

The causes can be understood as a chain of events and underlying conditions:

### 1. The Foundation: The U.S. Housing Bubble

In the early 2000s, a massive bubble formed in the U.S. housing market. Several forces inflated it:

*   **Low Interest Rates:** Following the dot-com bubble burst and the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. Federal Reserve, led by Alan Greenspan, slashed interest rates to historic lows (reaching 1% in 2003). This made borrowing money extremely cheap for both homebuyers and financial institutions.
*   **Global Savings Glut:** A surge of capital from fast-growing economies (like China) and oil-exporting nations poured into the U.S., seeking safe investments. This flood of money further depressed interest rates and created immense demand for U.S. debt instruments, including those tied to mortgages.
*   **Belief in Ever-Rising Home Prices:** A widespread cultural and financial belief took hold that housing was a foolproof investment. This encouraged speculation and risk-taking by individuals and lenders alike.

### 2. The Fuel: Subprime Mortgages and Lax Lending Standards

To meet the voracious demand for housing and mortgage-related investments, lending standards deteriorated dramatically.

*   **Subprime Mortgages:** Lenders aggressively marketed high-risk loans to borrowers with poor credit histories and low incomes. These often came with predatory features, such as "teaser" rates that started low but would reset to much higher rates after a few years (Adjustable-Rate Mortgages or ARMs), and "NINJA" loans (No Income, No Job, or Assets).
*   **The "Originate-to-Distribute" Model:** Traditionally, banks held the mortgages they issued, making them careful about who they lent to. The new model involved lenders originating mortgages and then quickly selling them to investment banks on Wall Street. Since the original lender no longer bore the long-term risk of the loan defaulting, the incentive to ensure borrower quality vanished.

### 3. The Engine of Contagion: Securitization and Complex Financial Instruments

This is how a U.S. housing problem went global. Wall Street investment banks took the millions of mortgages they bought and engineered them into complex securities.

*   **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS):** Individual mortgages were bundled together by the thousands into financial products that could be bought and sold like stocks or bonds. Investors would receive payments as homeowners paid their mortgages.
*   **Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs):** The process was taken a step further. Investment banks would take pieces of various MBS (including the riskiest, subprime ones) and other debts, and bundle them *again* into new instruments called CDOs. These were sliced into different risk levels, or "tranches."
    *   The **senior tranches** were the safest, paid first, and received the highest credit ratings.
    *   The **mezzanine tranches** were riskier but offered higher returns.
    *   The **equity tranches** were the riskiest, paid last, and were the first to suffer losses, but offered the highest potential returns.
    The fatal flaw was that risk was not eliminated, merely repackaged. The safety of the senior tranches was based on the flawed assumption that housing prices would not fall nationwide and that defaults across thousands of mortgages would not be correlated.

### 4. The Accelerant: Flawed Credit Ratings and Derivatives

Two key actors amplified the danger and masked the true risk of these products:

*   **Credit Rating Agencies:** Agencies like Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch gave the senior tranches of even the riskiest subprime CDOs their highest possible rating: AAA. This stamp of safety made them eligible for purchase by pension funds, insurance companies, and other conservative institutional investors around the world who were legally required to hold safe assets. These agencies had a major conflict of interest, as they were paid by the very investment banks whose products they were rating.
*   **Credit Default Swaps (CDS):** These were essentially insurance policies on MBS and CDOs. An investor could buy a CDS to protect against a default. However, this market was completely unregulated. Firms like the insurance giant AIG sold hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of these swaps without having the capital to pay out if a large-scale default occurred. Furthermore, CDSs allowed investors to bet against securities they didn't even own, creating a massive, interconnected web of side-bets that magnified the entire system's risk.

### 5. The Tipping Point: The Bubble Bursts and the System Freezes

Starting in 2006, the conditions that created the bubble began to reverse.

*   **Interest Rate Hikes:** The Federal Reserve began raising interest rates to combat inflation. This caused the "teaser" rates on ARMs to reset upwards, leading to sharp increases in monthly payments that many subprime borrowers could not afford.
*   **Defaults and Foreclosures:** Homeowners began defaulting on their loans in record numbers. As foreclosures flooded the market with properties for sale, housing supply overwhelmed demand.
*   **The Crash:** For the first time in decades, U.S. home prices began to fall nationwide. This shattered the core assumption upon which the entire financial structure was built. As prices fell, many homeowners were left "underwater," owing more on their mortgage than their house was worth, which further incentivized defaults.

### 6. The Collapse: The Credit Crunch

The housing crash triggered a catastrophic chain reaction in the financial system:

*   **Toxic Assets:** The value of MBS and CDOs plummeted as the underlying mortgages defaulted. No one knew what these complex securities were truly worth, and they became known as "toxic assets."
*   **Loss of Trust:** Banks realized that they and their competitors were holding trillions of dollars in potentially worthless assets. Trust evaporated. Banks stopped lending to each other in the overnight market (the interbank market), fearing the borrowing institution might be insolvent. This was the **credit crunch**.
*   **Key Failures (2008):**
    *   **March:** Bear Stearns, a major investment bank, collapsed and was sold to JPMorgan Chase in a fire sale brokered by the Fed.
    *   **September:** The U.S. government nationalized mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
    *   **September 15:** **Lehman Brothers**, the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank, was allowed to file for bankruptcy. This was the pivotal moment. The government's decision not to save Lehman sent a shockwave of panic through the global system, as no one knew which institution was next or who was safe.
    *   **September 16:** AIG, which had sold massive amounts of credit default swaps, was on the verge of collapse. Fearing its failure would bring down all of its counterparties (including major global banks), the U.S. government bailed it out with an $85 billion loan, which eventually grew much larger.

In summary, the 2008 crisis was a perfect storm created by a housing bubble, irresponsible lending, complex and unregulated financial instruments that opaquely spread risk worldwide, and a catastrophic failure of regulation and risk management. When the bubble burst, the interconnectedness of the global financial system caused the crisis to spread far beyond the U.S. housing market, leading to a severe global recession.
