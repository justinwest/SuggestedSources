# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

Of course. Here is a comprehensive overview of the causes of the 2008 financial crisis.

The 2008 financial crisis was not the result of a single event but rather a "perfect storm" of interconnected factors that created a chain of failures across the global financial system. The causes can be broken down into several key areas:

### 1. The U.S. Housing Bubble

This was the epicenter of the crisis. For years leading up to 2008, U.S. housing prices rose to unsustainable levels, creating a massive economic bubble. The key drivers were:

*   **Low Interest Rates:** Following the dot-com bust and the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate to a historic low of 1% by 2003. This made borrowing money extremely cheap, fueling a surge in mortgage applications and housing demand.
*   **Subprime Mortgages:** As the demand for mortgages grew, lending standards were significantly relaxed. Lenders began aggressively marketing "subprime" loans to borrowers with poor credit histories and a higher risk of default. These often included:
    *   **Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs):** These offered a low introductory "teaser" rate that would later reset to a much higher rate, leading to payment shock for borrowers.
    *   **"NINJA" Loans:** Loans given with "No Income, No Job, or Assets" verification.
*   **Belief in Ever-Rising Prices:** A widespread belief took hold that housing prices would continue to rise indefinitely. This encouraged speculative buying and convinced lenders that even if a borrower defaulted, the bank could foreclose and sell the property for a profit.

### 2. Financial Innovation and the Securitization Food Chain

The housing bubble was able to inflate to such a degree because of complex financial instruments that disconnected lenders from the loans they were making. This process, known as securitization, worked as follows:

1.  **Origination:** A mortgage lender (like Countrywide Financial) would issue a subprime mortgage.
2.  **Packaging:** Investment banks (like Lehman Brothers or Bear Stearns) would buy thousands of these mortgages. They would bundle them together into a pool to create **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)**.
3.  **Slicing (Tranching):** The investment banks would then slice these MBS into different risk categories, or "tranches." The safest tranches (senior) would be paid first from mortgage payments, while the riskiest (equity) tranches would be paid last but offered a higher return.
4.  **Re-Packaging (CDOs):** The riskiest tranches from many different MBS were often bundled together again to create an even more complex product called a **Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO)**. The logic was that by diversifying across many different mortgages, the risk was minimized.
5.  **Sale:** These MBS and CDOs were sold to investors around the world—pension funds, insurance companies, other banks, and foreign governments.

This system created a critical **moral hazard**: the original lenders had no incentive to ensure the loans were sound because they quickly sold them off to the investment banks, collecting fees without retaining the long-term risk.

### 3. The Failure of Credit Rating Agencies

Investors relied on credit rating agencies—primarily **Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch**—to assess the risk of these complex financial products. The agencies gave their highest rating, **AAA (the safest possible)**, to over 75% of the tranches of these CDOs.

This was a catastrophic failure for two main reasons:

*   **Conflict of Interest:** The rating agencies were paid by the very investment banks whose products they were rating. This created a strong incentive to provide favorable ratings to win business.
*   **Flawed Models:** Their risk assessment models were based on historical data that assumed a nationwide collapse in housing prices was impossible. They treated mortgage defaults as isolated, uncorrelated events. When the entire housing market began to fall, their models broke down completely.

### 4. Deregulation and Lack of Oversight

A decades-long trend of financial deregulation created an environment where risk-taking could flourish without adequate checks. Key elements included:

*   **Repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act (1999):** This Depression-era law had separated commercial banking (which takes deposits) from riskier investment banking. Its repeal allowed commercial banks to engage in the high-risk activities of creating and trading products like CDOs.
*   **The "Shadow Banking System":** A vast, unregulated market for complex derivatives grew outside the traditional banking system. A key product here was the **Credit Default Swap (CDS)**.
    *   A **CDS** is essentially an insurance policy on a debt product. An investor who owned a CDO could buy a CDS from a company like **AIG** to protect against the CDO defaulting.
    *   AIG sold hundreds of billions of dollars worth of these "insurance policies" without setting aside enough capital to pay the claims if a widespread collapse occurred. The CDS market was completely unregulated.
*   **Inadequate Capital Requirements:** Banks were not required to hold enough capital in reserve to cover the potential losses from the risky assets on their books.

### The Unraveling: How It All Collapsed (2007-2008)

1.  **The Housing Bubble Bursts (2006-2007):** As the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates to curb inflation, the "teaser" rates on adjustable-rate mortgages reset. Homeowners faced massive payment increases they couldn't afford. They couldn't refinance because their home values were now falling. Defaults and foreclosures skyrocketed.
2.  **MBS and CDOs Become "Toxic Assets":** As homeowners defaulted, the mortgage payments that were supposed to flow to MBS and CDO holders dried up. These once "AAA-rated" securities became nearly worthless, now known as "toxic assets."
3.  **Credit Markets Freeze:** Financial institutions realized their balance sheets were filled with these toxic assets. No one knew which banks were solvent, so they stopped lending to each other. This freeze in the interbank lending market is what paralyzed the entire financial system.
4.  **The Dominoes Fall (2008):**
    *   **March:** Bear Stearns, a major investment bank, collapses and is sold to JPMorgan Chase in a fire sale brokered by the Fed.
    *   **September:** The U.S. government is forced to take over **Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac**, the two government-sponsored mortgage giants, to prevent their collapse.
    *   **September 15:** **Lehman Brothers**, the fourth-largest investment bank, declares bankruptcy. The government chose not to bail it out, hoping to avoid moral hazard. This decision sent shockwaves of panic through the global financial system, as no one knew who was exposed to Lehman's losses.
    *   **September 16:** **AIG**, the world's largest insurer, was on the brink of collapse because it could not pay out on the tens of billions in Credit Default Swaps it had sold. Fearing its failure would trigger a chain reaction that would bankrupt the entire global banking system, the U.S. government bailed it out for $85 billion (a figure that would eventually grow to $182 billion).

### Conclusion

In summary, the 2008 financial crisis was caused by a combination of a U.S. housing bubble fueled by easy credit and subprime lending; the creation of complex, unregulated financial products (MBS and CDOs) that concealed risk; a fundamental failure by credit rating agencies to do their job; and a regulatory philosophy that allowed massive, unchecked risk-taking throughout the financial system. When the housing bubble burst, it triggered a domino effect that froze credit markets and brought the global economy to the brink of collapse.
