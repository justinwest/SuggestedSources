# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

Answer

The 2008 financial crisis was not the result of one mistake but of several reinforcing forces that built up during the U.S. housing boom and then unraveled almost simultaneously.  The key links in the causal chain were:

1.  A historic housing bubble  
   •  After the 2001 recession the Federal Reserve cut its target rate to 1 %, and a global “savings glut” kept longer-term rates low.  Cheap credit and the widespread belief that house prices “never fall nationally” pushed home prices far above fundamentals [2], [6].

2.  Rapid deterioration in mortgage-lending standards  
   •  To keep volume growing, lenders increasingly originated sub-prime, Alt-A and “no-doc/low-doc” (“liar”) loans that required little proof of income or assets [3], [4].  
   •  Countrywide, for example, paid employees more for steering borrowers into risky adjustable-rate mortgages, while down-payment requirements, credit scores and verification rules were relaxed across the industry [4], [6].

3.  Securitization and structured finance  
   •  Originators immediately sold most mortgages to Wall Street, which bundled them into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and then into multi-layered collateralized-debt obligations (CDOs).  Because the upper “tranches” received investment-grade ratings, risk was widely dispersed—often to investors that did not understand it [5], [6].  
   •  The ability to pass loans on (“originate-to-distribute”) removed lenders’ incentive to assure quality [1], [6].

4.  Excessive leverage and short-term funding  
   •  Large investment banks, government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), and the burgeoning “shadow banking system” financed huge MBS and CDO inventories with very thin equity and overnight repo borrowing.  When the market turned, they faced sudden margin calls and runs [6].

5.  Failures of risk management, ratings and regulation  
   •  Models used by rating agencies and bank risk officers assumed continued house-price appreciation; they did not capture how correlated nationwide defaults would be if prices fell [2], [5], [6].  
   •  No single regulator saw the full build-up of leverage, and existing capital rules gave banks incentives to hold highly-rated mortgage securities instead of making traditional loans [6].

6.  The trigger: house-price reversal and rising defaults  
   •  When mortgage rates reset higher in 2006–07 and housing supply began to outstrip demand, prices stalled and then fell.  Negative equity made default rational for millions of sub-prime and option-ARM borrowers.  Losses first hit MBS holders, then quickly spread through highly-leveraged institutions world-wide [2], [6].

7.  Systemic contagion  
   •  Fears about the real value of mortgage assets froze inter-bank lending and the repo market.  Bear Stearns collapsed in March 2008; Lehman Brothers’ failure in September caused a global funding panic, forcing extraordinary lender-of-last-resort and fiscal measures.

In short, the crisis was caused by the interaction of an over-inflated housing market, the mass production of weak mortgages, the opaque packaging and mis-rating of those mortgages, and a highly-leveraged financial system that was neither governed by adequate private risk controls nor constrained by effective regulation.  Once house prices turned, losses cascaded through the securitization chain and the short-term wholesale funding market, culminating in the worst financial panic since the Great Depression.
