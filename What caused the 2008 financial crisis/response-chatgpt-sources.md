# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

Causes of the 2008 financial crisis  

1. A huge U.S. housing-price bubble  
   • After the 2001 recession the Federal Reserve kept short-term rates very low, making mortgages unusually cheap. Easy credit, together with widespread optimism that house prices could “only go up,” pushed national home prices up 80 % between 2000 and their peak in 2006 [3].  
   • Federal tax preferences for mortgage interest and ever-looser underwriting standards (low- or no-documentation “Alt-A” and sub-prime loans) further stoked demand [1].  

2. Public policy that systematically steered more money into high-risk mortgages  
   • Congress and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development set “affordable-housing” targets for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and pressed private banks under the Community Reinvestment Act to expand lending to lower-income and minority borrowers. This political push made the fastest growth occur precisely in the least-documented, highest-default slices of the market [2][3].  
   • Basel capital rules let banks hold only a fraction of the equity against AAA-rated mortgage securities that they had to hold against ordinary whole mortgages, giving large institutions a regulatory incentive to manufacture “safe” mortgage bonds out of risky loans [1].  

3. Financial engineering that hid the true risk  
   • Sub-prime and Alt-A mortgages were pooled and carved into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Because the top tranches earned AAA ratings, global investors treated them almost like Treasury bonds even though their ultimate repayment depended on highly leveraged bets on home prices [1][3].  
   • Credit-rating agencies were paid by the issuers of the bonds they rated, creating obvious conflicts of interest. When the underlying loans began to sour, ratings were slashed and the supposedly “safe” tranches suddenly became toxic.  

4. Excessive leverage and fragile short-term funding  
   • Large investment banks, hedge funds, and off-balance-sheet “structured-investment vehicles” financed long-term mortgage assets with overnight repo and commercial paper. Leverage ratios frequently exceeded 30-to-1, leaving the firms vulnerable to even modest price declines [3][4].  
   • When investors lost confidence in mortgage collateral in 2007, a classic wholesale funding run began. Firms such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers could not roll over their short-term debt and failed, freezing credit markets worldwide.  

5. Inadequate risk management and supervision  
   • Regulators focused on the solvency of individual institutions, not on the system-wide build-up of correlated mortgage risk (so-called “macro-prudential” blindness).  
   • Supervisors accepted the internal risk models of large banks and the judgments of rating agencies, and they failed to see the rapid migration of credit intermediation to lightly regulated “shadow-bank” entities [1][3][4].  

How the elements interacted  

The political drive for broad homeownership and low capital charges made sub-prime lending grow explosively. Securitization spread that risk around the world while disguising how dependent the securities were on ever-rising U.S. house prices. Once prices turned down in 2006–07, defaults on the weakest loans rose, triggering downgrades, margin calls, and a generalized run on the shadow-bank system. Losses forced fire-sales of assets, wiping out bank capital and creating a feedback loop of falling prices, tightening credit, and still more losses—culminating in the global crisis of 2008.  

No single factor suffices to explain the disaster; rather, it was the intersection of a housing bubble, distortionary government incentives, unchecked financial innovation, high leverage, and poor regulation that turned a real-estate downturn into the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
