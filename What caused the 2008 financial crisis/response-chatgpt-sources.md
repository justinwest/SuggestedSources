# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

The 2008 financial crisis did not have a single trigger; it was the product of several mutually reinforcing forces that began years earlier and culminated in the panic of September-October 2008.

1. A historic housing boom—and an accompanying belief that U.S. house prices “always go up”—encouraged ever-riskier mortgage lending. Between 1997 and 2006 the national Case-Shiller index doubled, outpacing income growth and rents [3].

2. Loose underwriting fed the boom. Lenders increasingly offered subprime, “Alt-A,” and “no-doc” (“liar”) loans that required neither proof of income nor large down-payments [4]. Countrywide Financial, the largest mortgage originator, deliberately pushed such products to hit volume targets and Wall Street demand for high-yield mortgages [5].

3. Policymakers and GSE mandates added tailwinds. From the mid-1990s through the early 2000s HUD repeatedly raised the “affordable-housing” purchase goals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, pressuring them to buy and securitize more low-quality loans [9][10]. Presidents Clinton and Bush both championed broader home-ownership (Bush’s 2004 “ownership society” speech is typical) [8].

4. Securitization spread the risk but also obscured it. Banks bundled thousands of mortgages into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and then into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Tranches of these CDOs received AAA ratings even when they were ultimately backed by sub-prime loans [6]. Because the loans had been sold, originators no longer bore default risk and had little incentive to maintain strict standards (“originate-to-distribute” model) [1][7].

5. Excessive leverage and short-term funding. Large investment banks such as Lehman, Bear Stearns, and Merrill Lynch funded huge positions in mortgage-linked assets with overnight repo borrowing at leverage ratios of 30-to-1 or more. When the underlying collateral lost value, the funding evaporated, forcing fire sales and further depressing prices [7].

6. Derivatives multiplied the exposure. Credit-default swaps (CDS) written by AIG and others acted as side bets on the performance of MBS and CDOs. Because these positions were largely unregulated and unfunded, losses quickly exceeded available capital once defaults accelerated [7].

7. Rating-agency and regulatory failures. Agencies used models that relied on ever-rising home prices; tranches that later became worthless had been stamped AAA. Regulators permitted commercial banks to hold AAA securitizations with minimal capital and allowed investment banks to set their own value-at-risk models, amplifying systemic risk [7].

8. A classic liquidity panic. When house prices started falling in mid-2006, delinquencies soared in 2007, revealing the weakness of the securities built on those loans. Confidence in counterparties collapsed, money-market funds fled repo and commercial paper markets, and in September 2008 Lehman Brothers failed, triggering a global run on short-term funding [3][7].

In short, the crisis resulted from the interaction of (a) a housing bubble, (b) deteriorating mortgage quality encouraged by lenders, investors, and public policy, (c) securitization and derivatives that hid true risk and transmitted losses worldwide, and (d) excessive leverage inside a lightly regulated shadow-banking system. When the bubble burst, the highly leveraged system could not absorb the losses, leading to a systemic panic and the deepest recession since the 1930s.
