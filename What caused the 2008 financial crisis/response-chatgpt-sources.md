# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

What caused the 2008 financial crisis?  
The short answer is that a combination of an historic housing bubble, the mass production of risky mortgages, the securitization of those mortgages into highly-rated but poorly understood bonds, a build-up of leverage throughout the financial system, and large regulatory/managerial failures led to a sudden loss of confidence in 2007-08 that nearly brought down the global banking system.

Below is a step-by-step explanation of how those elements came together.

1. A macro-environment that encouraged risk  
   • After the 2001 recession the Federal Reserve kept short-term interest rates very low, while global “savings-glut” capital from Asia and the oil-exporting states pushed long-term rates down as well. Investors therefore searched for higher-yielding assets [3].  
   • U.S. housing appeared safe and profitable, and government policy—through the GSEs, the Community Reinvestment Act, and a political push for “ownership society”—reinforced demand for mortgages [1][7].

2. The housing bubble and the collapse of underwriting standards  
   • House prices rose roughly 80 % nationally between 1998 and 2006, convincing lenders, borrowers, and investors that collateral values would always bail them out [2][3].  
   • Competition for volume led originators such as Countrywide to offer subprime, Alt-A, “no-doc” or “liar” loans that required little income verification and had low teaser rates that reset upward after two or three years [4][5].  
   • Because originators immediately sold the loans to Wall Street, they had little incentive to care about long-term credit quality—this is the “originate-to-distribute” model [3].

3. Securitization, CDOs, and the creation of opaque risk  
   • Investment banks pooled thousands of mortgages into mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The riskiest slices (subprime and Alt-A) were then bundled again into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Rating agencies often labeled the senior tranches AAA even though their value depended on the health of risky underlying loans [6].  
   • Investors around the world—money-market funds, pension plans, European banks—bought these “high-yield, low-risk” products, spreading U.S. housing risk globally [3].

4. Extreme leverage and the shadow-banking system  
   • Major broker-dealers funded their huge MBS/CDO inventories with overnight repurchase (“repo”) loans, often levered 25–40-to-1. Commercial banks used off-balance-sheet “structured investment vehicles” (SIVs) for similar purposes.  
   • Because much of this financing was short-term, even a small decline in the market value of the securities threatened insolvency and forced fire-sales [3].

5. Regulatory, managerial, and ethical failures  
   • U.S. regulators did not set minimum standards for subprime lending or cap leverage at the biggest investment banks after the 2004 SEC rule change. Derivatives such as credit-default swaps were left largely unregulated by the 2000 CFMA [3].  
   • Bank executives chased market share and bonuses. Countrywide, for example, offered pay incentives that rewarded loan volume, not quality, and managers ignored internal warnings about fraud and misrepresentation [5].  
   • Rating agencies were paid by the issuers whose bonds they rated, producing clear conflicts of interest [3].

6. The tipping point: falling house prices and rising defaults  
   • U.S. house prices peaked in mid-2006; when they started to fall, adjustable-rate subprime borrowers could neither refinance nor meet higher payments, causing delinquencies to spike [2].  
   • By 2007 the lower-rated tranches of MBS and CDOs collapsed in price. Because models had assumed regional diversification that did not exist, the rating agencies were forced into mass downgrades [6].

7. Contagion and systemic crisis  
   • Funding markets froze after BNP Paribas halted withdrawals from three mortgage funds (Aug. 2007). Bear Stearns failed in March 2008, followed by the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, and the bailout of AIG in September 2008 [2][3].  
   • With trust in counterparties evaporating, credit markets seized globally, prompting unprecedented lender-of-last-resort actions by the Federal Reserve and massive fiscal interventions (TARP, stimulus packages).

In sum, the 2008 financial crisis was not the product of a single mistake but of reinforcing layers of excess—easy money, rapid credit growth, lax lending, complex securitization, unchecked leverage, and weak oversight—that unraveled when the U.S. housing boom reversed. The interaction of those forces transformed a correction in one asset class into a worldwide financial panic.
