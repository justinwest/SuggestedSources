# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

The 2008 financial crisis was caused by a complex web of interconnected factors that created a perfect storm in the housing and financial markets. The crisis stemmed from the collapse of the subprime mortgage market, which then cascaded through the broader financial system due to securitization and excessive risk-taking.

## Housing Market Bubble and Subprime Lending

The foundation of the crisis lay in the dramatic expansion of subprime mortgage lending during the early 2000s. Financial institutions increasingly offered loans to borrowers with poor credit histories, often with little to no documentation of income or assets [4]. These "no doc" loans became widespread, allowing borrowers to obtain mortgages without proving their ability to repay them [4]. The Federal Reserve's analysis shows that subprime lending grew exponentially, with these risky mortgages comprising an increasingly large share of the market [3].

Government policies also played a significant role in encouraging homeownership. The Bush administration actively promoted expanding homeownership, particularly among minorities and low-income families [8][9]. Federal housing goals were established requiring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase increasing percentages of loans made to low- and moderate-income borrowers [10]. These policies created additional demand for subprime mortgages and helped fuel the housing bubble.

## Financial Innovation and Risk Amplification

The crisis was amplified by complex financial instruments that spread risk throughout the global financial system. Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) allowed banks to package mortgages and other debts into securities that could be sold to investors [6]. This process, known as securitization, was supposed to distribute risk but instead concentrated it in ways that were poorly understood.

The Econlib analysis points out that despite asymmetric information theory suggesting that lenders should have been cautious about borrower quality, the securitization process created perverse incentives [1]. Lenders could originate risky loans and quickly sell them off, transferring the risk to investors while keeping the origination fees.

## Regulatory Failures and Market Distortions

The crisis was exacerbated by regulatory failures and market distortions. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission's comprehensive report documents how regulatory agencies failed to adequately oversee the growing risks in the financial system [7]. Companies like Countrywide Financial engaged in predatory lending practices, offering loans they knew borrowers could not afford while prioritizing short-term profits over long-term stability [5].

The government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, operating under congressional mandates to promote homeownership, purchased large quantities of subprime mortgages, further inflating the bubble [10]. Their implicit government backing allowed them to take on enormous risks while privatizing profits and socializing losses.

## The Collapse and Contagion

When housing prices began to decline in 2006-2007, the entire system unraveled rapidly. Subprime borrowers defaulted in massive numbers, causing the value of mortgage-backed securities to plummet [3]. Financial institutions that had invested heavily in these instruments faced severe losses, leading to a credit crunch that spread throughout the global economy.

The interconnectedness of financial institutions through complex derivatives and the concentration of risk in systemically important firms meant that the failure of key players like Lehman Brothers threatened the entire financial system [7]. What began as a problem in one segment of the mortgage market ultimately required unprecedented government intervention to prevent a complete economic collapse.
