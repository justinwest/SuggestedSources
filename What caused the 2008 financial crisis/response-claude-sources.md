# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

The 2008 financial crisis was caused by a complex interplay of factors that created a perfect storm in the housing and financial markets. The crisis can be attributed to several key elements:

## Housing Bubble and Subprime Lending

The crisis originated in the U.S. housing market, where a massive bubble formed due to artificially low interest rates and aggressive lending practices. Financial institutions began issuing subprime mortgages to borrowers with poor credit histories or insufficient income to support their loans [1]. This was facilitated by government policies that encouraged homeownership and the belief that housing prices would continue to rise indefinitely.

## Securitization and Risk Distribution

Banks packaged these risky mortgages into complex financial instruments called mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). This process, known as securitization, allowed banks to sell off their mortgage risk to investors worldwide, creating a false sense of security and encouraging even more reckless lending [1]. The risk was distributed throughout the global financial system, making the eventual collapse more severe and widespread.

## Regulatory Failures and Moral Hazard

Government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac played a significant role by purchasing and guaranteeing mortgages, which encouraged lenders to lower their standards [1]. Additionally, the "too big to fail" mentality created moral hazard, where large financial institutions took excessive risks knowing they would likely be bailed out by the government.

## Real Estate Market Dynamics

The crisis was exacerbated by speculative investment in real estate markets, particularly in areas with rapid population growth and limited housing supply [2]. When housing prices began to decline, homeowners found themselves underwater on their mortgages, leading to widespread defaults and foreclosures.

## Credit Rating Agencies and Information Asymmetries

Credit rating agencies gave AAA ratings to many mortgage-backed securities that were actually highly risky, misleading investors about the true nature of these investments. This contributed to the widespread purchase of toxic assets by banks, pension funds, and other financial institutions.

The combination of these factors created a cascading effect: as housing prices fell, mortgage defaults increased, leading to massive losses for financial institutions, credit market freezes, and ultimately a global recession that required unprecedented government intervention to stabilize the financial system.
