# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

The 2008 financial crisis resulted from a complex interplay of factors that created a perfect storm in the housing and financial markets. The crisis can be traced to several interconnected causes:

## Subprime Mortgage Lending and Risky Loan Practices

The foundation of the crisis lay in the dramatic expansion of subprime mortgage lending to borrowers with poor credit histories or insufficient income documentation [1]. Financial institutions increasingly offered "no doc" or "NINJA" (No Income, No Job, No Assets) loans that required minimal verification of borrowers' ability to repay [4]. These practices were exemplified by companies like Countrywide Financial, which engaged in predatory lending by targeting vulnerable borrowers with loans they could not afford [5].

## Securitization and Financial Innovation

Banks packaged these risky mortgages into complex financial instruments called mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) [6]. This securitization process allowed banks to transfer risk off their balance sheets while continuing to originate loans, creating a moral hazard where loan quality deteriorated because originators no longer bore the default risk [1][3].

## Housing Bubble and Government Policy

Government policies promoting homeownership, including pressure on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase subprime mortgages, contributed to the crisis by encouraging risky lending practices [2][7]. Low interest rates maintained by the Federal Reserve also fueled the housing bubble by making credit cheap and abundant [3].

## Regulatory Failures and Systemic Risk

The crisis was exacerbated by inadequate regulatory oversight of the financial system. Regulators failed to recognize the systemic risks posed by the interconnected nature of financial institutions and the concentration of mortgage-related assets across the banking system [7]. The complexity of derivative instruments made it difficult to assess true risk exposure.

## Market Collapse and Contagion

When housing prices began to decline in 2006-2007, the entire system unraveled. Subprime borrowers defaulted en masse, mortgage-backed securities lost value, and financial institutions faced massive losses. The interconnected nature of the financial system meant that problems spread rapidly from housing to credit markets and eventually to the broader economy [3][7].
