# What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

The 2008 financial crisis resulted from a complex interplay of factors that created a perfect storm in the housing and financial markets. The crisis can be traced to several key causes that amplified each other's effects.

## Housing Bubble and Subprime Lending

The crisis originated in the U.S. housing market, where a massive bubble developed due to artificially low interest rates and relaxed lending standards [1]. Financial institutions began issuing subprime mortgages to borrowers with poor credit histories, often with little to no documentation of income or assets [2]. These "no doc" loans became increasingly common, allowing borrowers to obtain mortgages without proper verification of their ability to repay [3].

Government policies played a significant role in encouraging this expansion of homeownership. The Bush administration actively promoted increased homeownership rates, with President Bush stating in 2004 that "we want everybody in America to own their own home" [4]. Federal agencies like HUD implemented initiatives to increase homeownership, particularly among minority and low-income communities [5]. Additionally, government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were given higher housing goals, requiring them to purchase more loans made to low- and moderate-income borrowers [6].

## Financial Engineering and Risk Distribution

Banks and financial institutions developed sophisticated methods to package and sell these risky mortgages. They created collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which bundled mortgages and other debt instruments into complex securities that were sold to investors worldwide [7]. This process, known as securitization, allowed banks to originate loans and quickly sell them off, removing the risk from their balance sheets but also eliminating their incentive to ensure loan quality.

Companies like Countrywide Financial became emblematic of predatory lending practices, aggressively marketing subprime loans while knowing many borrowers would likely default [8]. The securitization process meant that the original lenders no longer bore the risk of default, creating a moral hazard where loan quality deteriorated significantly.

## Regulatory Failures and Oversight Gaps

The crisis was exacerbated by regulatory failures and gaps in oversight. Financial regulators failed to adequately supervise the growing subprime mortgage market and the complex derivatives built upon it [1][9]. The shadow banking system, which included investment banks and other non-bank financial institutions, operated with minimal regulation while taking on enormous risks.

Credit rating agencies also failed in their duties, giving AAA ratings to mortgage-backed securities that later proved to be highly risky [9]. This allowed toxic assets to be marketed as safe investments to pension funds, insurance companies, and other institutional investors worldwide.

## The Collapse and Contagion

When housing prices began to decline in 2006-2007, the entire system unraveled rapidly. Subprime borrowers defaulted in massive numbers, causing the value of mortgage-backed securities to plummet [1][2]. Financial institutions that had invested heavily in these securities faced enormous losses. The interconnected nature of the global financial system meant that the crisis quickly spread beyond the U.S. housing market to banks and financial institutions worldwide.

Major financial institutions like Lehman Brothers collapsed, while others required government bailouts to survive. The crisis demonstrated how the combination of deregulation, perverse incentives, government housing policies, and financial innovation had created systemic risks that threatened the entire global economy [9].
