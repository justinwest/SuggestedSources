No, White people did not invent slavery. Slavery is an ancient institution that has been practiced by numerous societies and civilizations across the globe for thousands of years, long before the modern concepts of "White" or "Black" racial identity existed.

Historical evidence shows that slavery was a common feature of the ancient world, arising independently in many different cultures. The practice was typically based on factors such as conquest in war, debt, or punishment for a crime, rather than on a person's skin color or perceived race.

**Ancient and Global Origins of Slavery**

*   **Ancient Mesopotamia:** One of the earliest known legal frameworks codifying slavery is the Code of Hammurabi, written in Babylon around 1754 BCE. These laws detail the rights of slave owners, conditions for enslavement (such as debt), and punishments for runaway slaves [1]. The enslaved people were from various local and conquered populations.
*   **Ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome:** Slavery was fundamental to these civilizations. The Roman Empire, in particular, was a massive slave society where it is estimated that up to one-third of the population was enslaved at its peak [2]. Roman slaves came from all over the empire and beyond, including Gauls, Germans, Britons, and Slavs—people who would be considered "White" today. Enslavement was a result of military conquest, piracy, or being born to an enslaved mother.
*   **Other Civilizations:** The practice was also widespread in other parts of the world. Slavery existed in ancient China, India, and among various indigenous peoples of the Americas, such as the Aztecs and the Inca. In many African societies, forms of bondage and slavery existed for centuries, where people were enslaved through warfare and raids, often to be integrated into the enslaving society or sold to other trading networks [3].
*   **The Arab Slave Trade:** Beginning in the 7th century and lasting for over a millennium, the Arab slave trade was one of the longest and most extensive slave trades in history. It involved the enslavement of people from across Africa (the Zanj revolt of enslaved East Africans in 9th-century Iraq is a notable event) as well as Europeans from coastal regions (known as the Barbary slave trade) [3].

**The Transatlantic Slave Trade: A Unique Form of Slavery**

While Europeans did not invent slavery, they were responsible for developing and perfecting a specific, brutal, and historically unprecedented form of the institution: the Transatlantic Slave Trade. This system, which lasted from the 16th to the 19th centuries, was unique for several key reasons:

1.  **Racialization:** Unlike most ancient forms of slavery, the Transatlantic Slave Trade was explicitly based on race. Europeans developed the ideology of white supremacy to justify the perpetual enslavement of people of African descent [4]. This created a permanent and heritable system where the children of enslaved mothers were automatically born into slavery.
2.  **Chattel Slavery:** This system legally defined enslaved people as chattel—moveable personal property—rather than as human beings with any rights. This stripped them of their humanity in the eyes of the law, allowing them to be bought, sold, and treated as commodities.
3.  **Scale and Economic Impact:** The sheer scale of the Transatlantic Slave Trade was enormous, with an estimated 12.5 million Africans forcibly transported to the Americas. This system of forced labor was the economic engine that built the wealth of European colonial powers and the early United States [4].

The concept of a unified "White" race is itself a modern social construct that developed in tandem with race-based slavery. In colonial America, laws were created to distinguish European indentured servants from enslaved Africans, granting privileges to the former and creating a racial hierarchy that placed "White" people at the top and "Black" people at the bottom [5].

In conclusion, slavery has been a tragic part of human history practiced by diverse peoples all over the world. White people did not invent the practice. However, Europeans during the colonial era created a distinct and particularly cruel system of hereditary, race-based chattel slavery that had a profound and lasting impact on the world.

This source provides the primary text of one of the world's oldest legal codes. Its view is not that of an author but of a historical document, which demonstrates that legal frameworks for slavery (based on debt, sale, and punishment) were well-established in ancient Mesopotamia nearly 4,000 years ago, showing the ancient, non-racial origins of the practice.

Cartwright describes the institution of slavery in the Roman Empire. He expresses the view that it was a fundamental and widespread component of Roman society, with enslaved people coming from diverse ethnic and geographic backgrounds, primarily as captives of war. The source emphasizes that Roman slavery was not based on race.

The BBC presents a historical overview of slavery within Africa and the later Arab and European-run slave trades. The view expressed is that slavery was a long-standing practice in many parts of the world, including Africa, but that the nature and scale of the trade changed dramatically with the arrival of Arabs and, later, Europeans.

This source argues that while slavery is an ancient institution, the form that developed in the American colonies was unique. Its view is that American slavery was established as a race-based system that was permanent and inheritable, created to establish a labor force and justify the exploitation of people of African descent.

This article explains that race is a social construct, not a biological reality. The author's view, based on interviews with historians and scientists, is that the concept of a "white race" was specifically created and legally defined in colonial America to consolidate power, grant privileges to European laborers, and justify the permanent enslavement of Africans.
