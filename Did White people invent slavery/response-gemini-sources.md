No, white people did not invent slavery. Historical and archaeological evidence shows that slavery is an ancient practice that has existed across nearly every continent, culture, and race for thousands of years, predating the modern concept of "white" people and European colonialism [1, 2].

Slavery was a common feature of ancient civilizations long before the Atlantic slave trade. Some of the earliest written laws, such as the Code of Hammurabi from Mesopotamia (c. 1754 BCE), include detailed regulations concerning slaves [1, 2]. The practice was widespread in ancient Egypt, Greece, and the Roman Empire, where it was a fundamental part of the society and economy, with slaves being acquired through conquest, debt, or being born to enslaved parents [2].

The practice was not limited to the ancient Mediterranean or Europe. Slavery existed in various forms across Asia, including in China, Korea, and India [1]. It was also practiced by indigenous peoples in the Americas, such as the Aztecs, Mayans, and Incas, before the arrival of Europeans [2]. In Africa, various forms of slavery and servitude existed within different societies for centuries, where people were enslaved through warfare, for debt, or as punishment for crimes. These pre-existing systems were later exploited and dramatically expanded by the transatlantic slave trade [1, 2].

The etymology of the word "slave" itself points to a European group being enslaved on a massive scale. The word entered the English language from the Old French *esclave*, derived from the Medieval Latin *sclavus*, which originally meant "Slav." This term arose during the early Middle Ages when a large number of Slavic peoples from Eastern Europe were captured and enslaved by various groups, including Moors in the Iberian Peninsula and the Byzantine Empire [1, 3].

While Europeans did not invent slavery, the transatlantic slave trade, which primarily took place from the 16th to the 19th centuries, had distinct and particularly brutal characteristics. It was a form of chattel slavery on an immense scale, where enslaved people were legally considered property (chattel) and this status was permanent and hereditary [4]. This system became increasingly and systematically codified along racial lines, with the enslavement of people of African descent justified by racist ideologies [2, 4]. It is also important to note that while Europeans were central participants in the transatlantic slave trade, social and political movements to abolish slavery on a global scale first gained significant traction in Western nations like Great Britain and the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries [1, 2].
