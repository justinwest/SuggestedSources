No, white people did not invent slavery. Slavery is an ancient institution that has existed across virtually all civilizations, cultures, and ethnic groups throughout human history, predating any modern conception of racial categories by thousands of years.

## Historical Evidence of Slavery Across Cultures

Slavery existed in ancient civilizations long before the transatlantic slave trade or European colonialism. Archaeological and historical evidence shows that slavery was practiced in ancient Mesopotamia as early as 3500 BCE, with the Sumerian Code of Ur-Nammu (circa 2100 BCE) containing laws regulating slavery [1]. Ancient Egypt extensively used slave labor, including for pyramid construction, with evidence dating back to the Old Kingdom period (2686-2181 BCE) [2].

The practice was widespread across ancient civilizations including Greece, Rome, China, India, and various African kingdoms. The Code of Hammurabi from ancient Babylon (circa 1750 BCE) dedicated numerous laws to the regulation of slaves, demonstrating how institutionalized the practice was in early civilizations [2]. Islamic societies also practiced slavery extensively, with the Arab slave trade predating and outlasting the Atlantic slave trade [1].

## Slavery in Non-European Contexts

Indigenous peoples throughout the Americas practiced forms of slavery before European contact. The Aztec, Maya, and Inca civilizations all had complex slave systems [3]. In Africa, various kingdoms and empires including the Kingdom of Kush, the Mali Empire, and the Songhai Empire practiced slavery centuries before European involvement in the African slave trade [1][3].

Asian civilizations similarly had long histories of slavery. China had institutionalized slavery from ancient times through the early 20th century, while slavery in India existed from ancient times and took various forms including debt bondage [3].

## The Transatlantic Slave Trade in Context

While Europeans did not invent slavery, they did develop and systematize the transatlantic slave trade, which represented a particularly brutal and racially-based form of chattel slavery from the 15th to 19th centuries. This system was unique in its scale, its racial ideology, and its hereditary nature - where children of enslaved people were automatically enslaved [1][4].

It's important to note that the transatlantic slave trade often relied on existing African slave-trading networks and involved African intermediaries who captured and sold other Africans to European traders [1]. This doesn't diminish European responsibility but demonstrates that slavery was already an established practice in many African societies.

## Modern Perspectives

Today, slavery continues to exist in various forms worldwide, affecting an estimated 40 million people according to the International Labour Organization, with the majority of modern slaves being in Asia and Africa [4]. This ongoing reality further demonstrates that slavery is not an invention of any single racial or ethnic group but rather a tragic practice that has appeared throughout human history across all populated continents.

The historical record clearly shows that slavery is a human institution that has appeared independently in countless societies throughout history, regardless of race, ethnicity, or geography.
