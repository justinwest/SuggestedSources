Short answer: No. Slavery long predates the modern idea of “white people” and arose independently in many parts of the world. The earliest written laws already presume slavery, and the practice appears in the ancient Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Americas thousands of years before the Atlantic slave trade [1][2][3].

What history shows
- Ancient Near East: The Code of Hammurabi (c. 1754 BCE) contains multiple laws about enslaved people, showing slavery was an established institution in Mesopotamia millennia ago [2][3].
- Classical Mediterranean: Enslaved labor was routine and foundational in ancient Greece and Rome for agriculture, mines, households, and public works [4][5].
- Northern Europe: Vikings captured and traded enslaved people (thralls) during the early medieval period, centuries before Atlantic racial slavery [6].
- Africa (before European colonization): Diverse forms of slavery and servitude existed (e.g., domestic slavery, military slavery, pawnship), integrated into some political and economic systems and regional trade networks across the Sahel, West, and East Africa [7].
- Indigenous Americas: Enslavement of captives and coerced labor existed well before European arrival. The Aztec tlacotin system is a documented example; Native enslavement also expanded under Spanish colonization [8][9].
- Asia: Longstanding forms of slavery and bonded labor existed in China, India, and elsewhere in Asia across many centuries [1].

What was distinctive about early modern European slavery
- Europeans did not invent slavery, but from the 1400s–1800s they built the largest long-distance slave-trading system in history: the transatlantic slave trade, transporting over 12 million Africans to the Americas, with roughly 10–11 million surviving the Middle Passage [10][11].
- This Atlantic system increasingly tied slavery to race. Laws in European colonies defined African-descended people and their children as inheritable property (e.g., Virginia’s 1662 statute, partus sequitur ventrem), creating a hereditary, racialized, chattel system unlike many earlier forms [12].
- Modern “race” categories, including “white,” are themselves historical, socially constructed classifications that took shape alongside colonial expansion and slavery; they are not timeless biological divisions [13].

Conclusion
White people did not invent slavery. Slavery was practiced in many societies long before Europeans constructed the specific, racialized chattel slavery system that dominated the Atlantic world from the 16th to the 19th centuries [1][10][11][12].
