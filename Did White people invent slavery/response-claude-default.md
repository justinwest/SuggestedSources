No, white people did not invent slavery. Slavery is an ancient institution that has existed across virtually all continents and among peoples of every racial and ethnic background throughout recorded human history [1][2].

## Historical Evidence of Slavery Across Cultures

Archaeological and historical evidence demonstrates that slavery existed in ancient Mesopotamia as early as 3500 BCE, with the Sumerian Code of Ur-Nammu (c. 2100 BCE) containing references to slaves [1]. Ancient Egypt extensively used slave labor, particularly for construction projects and agriculture, with evidence dating back to the Old Kingdom period (c. 2686-2181 BCE) [2].

In ancient China, slavery was documented during the Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 BCE), where prisoners of war and criminals were enslaved [3]. The practice continued through various Chinese dynasties for millennia. Similarly, slavery existed in ancient India, with references in Sanskrit texts and the caste system incorporating forms of bondage [1].

## Slavery in Africa Before European Contact

African societies practiced various forms of slavery long before European involvement in the Atlantic slave trade. Different African kingdoms and empires, including the Kingdom of Kush, the Ghana Empire, and the Mali Empire, incorporated slavery into their economic and social systems [4]. Trans-Saharan slave trade routes were established centuries before European maritime exploration, with Arab and Berber traders transporting enslaved Africans across the Sahara [2][4].

## Indigenous American Slavery

Pre-Columbian civilizations in the Americas, including the Aztec, Maya, and Inca empires, practiced forms of slavery and human bondage [3]. These systems operated independently of any European influence and were integral to their societies' economic and religious practices [1].

## The Atlantic Slave Trade and European Involvement

While Europeans did not invent slavery, they did develop and systematize the Atlantic slave trade between the 15th and 19th centuries, which represented a particularly brutal and racially-based form of chattel slavery [5]. This system differed from many earlier forms of slavery in its scale, its hereditary nature, and its explicit racial basis [4][5].

The Atlantic slave trade involved the forced transportation of an estimated 12.5 million Africans to the Americas, with European powers and later American colonists playing central roles in this system [5]. This particular manifestation of slavery had devastating and long-lasting impacts on African societies and created enduring racial hierarchies in the Americas [4].

## Conclusion

Slavery is a tragic institution that has appeared throughout human history across all inhabited continents and among diverse racial and ethnic groups. While European and American involvement in the Atlantic slave trade represented one of history's most systematic and devastating forms of slavery, the institution itself predates this period by thousands of years and was practiced by numerous civilizations worldwide [1][2][5].
