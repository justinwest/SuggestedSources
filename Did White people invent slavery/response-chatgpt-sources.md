Short answer
No. Systems of slavery emerged independently in many societies thousands of years before the modern racial category of “white people” existed. Europeans did not invent slavery, though European empires played a central role in developing, racializing, and massively expanding transatlantic chattel slavery in the Americas. [2][3][4][7]

What the historical record shows
- Antiquity: Enslaved labor is documented in the earliest written legal codes (e.g., the Code of Hammurabi, c. 18th century BCE) and was practiced in ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome long before early modern Europe. [2][3][4]
- Africa before European expansion: Varied forms of servitude and slavery existed across African societies prior to the Atlantic trade; these systems differed by region and period and were not identical to later racialized, hereditary chattel slavery in the Americas. [5]
- Indigenous Americas: Forms of captivity, coerced labor, and enslavement existed in parts of the Americas prior to and alongside European colonization; colonial powers also enslaved Indigenous peoples extensively. [9]
- Asia and elsewhere: Enslavement and other unfree statuses have appeared across many world regions, including in Asia, underscoring that slavery is a recurrent—though highly variable—human institution. [2][4]

What was distinctive about Atlantic slavery
- Scale and system: From the 1500s to the 1800s, European and American traders forcibly transported an estimated 12.5 million Africans across the Atlantic; about 10.7 million survived the Middle Passage. This racialized, hereditary chattel system was codified in law and sustained by transnational commerce. [6][7]
- Racialization and heredity: In the English colonies (later the United States), laws such as Virginia’s 1662 partus sequitur ventrem statute made slave status inheritable through the mother, helping entrench a race-based, lifelong, hereditary system. [8]

Bottom line
White people did not invent slavery; the institution is ancient and global. However, European colonial powers were pivotal in constructing and expanding the uniquely racialized, hereditary chattel slavery of the Atlantic world, whose human toll and legacies were profound. [2][5][6][7][8]
