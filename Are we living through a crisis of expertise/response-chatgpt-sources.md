# Are we living through a crisis of expertise?

Are we living through a crisis of expertise?  
The evidence assembled in recent scholarship, journalism and opinion writing suggests that we are passing through a moment in which the social authority of accredited experts is unusually fragile.  At the same time, the picture is complicated: the failures that have undermined confidence do not mean knowledge has become worthless, only that its custodians have lost public credit.  Below is a synthesis of the major themes that emerge from the sources supplied.

1. Falling trust in expert-run institutions  
•  In the United States the share of citizens who say they trust the federal government “most of the time” has collapsed from three-quarters in the early 1960s to barely one-fifth today, a historically low level that tracks similar declines for the civil service, scientific agencies and universities [4].  
•  A veteran NPR editor reports that his own newsroom has “lost America’s trust” by drifting from impartial reporting toward advocacy, reinforcing the idea that even information organisations once treated as neutral arbiters now face deep suspicion [13].  
•  Martin Gurri calls this a structural “crisis of authority”—digital media empowers the public to see elite error in real time and to organise dissent; every failure is instantly amplified and archived [3].

2. A catalogue of elite mistakes that fuel scepticism  
•  The Iraq War intelligence debacle (2003) still functions as a template for failed expertise, showing how highly credentialed analysts can be catastrophically wrong [9].  
•  The Global Financial Crisis (2008) and, more recently, the surprise resurgence of inflation after COVID-19 left many economists conceding that “economists don’t know what’s going on,” an admission that has damaged the profession’s mystique [5][6].  
•  During the pandemic, health authorities oscillated on masks, school closures and lab-leak evidence; political scientist Frances Lee says these reversals exposed “the limits of technocratic certainty” and showed experts to be both indispensable and fallible [1].  
•  High-profile cases of academic fraud—Harvard’s unprecedented decision to revoke a star professor’s tenure for data fabrication, for example—suggest that even the gatekeepers inside elite institutions can miss or tolerate wrongdoing [12].  

3. Structural problems inside knowledge-producing fields  
•  Meta-researchers report rising retractions, pervasive p-hacking, and the ease with which fraudulent data evade peer review, prompting calls for criminal penalties for scientific fraud [7][8].  
•  Essays with titles such as “The Failure of Economists” describe insular models, group-think and incentives that reward publishability over predictive accuracy, creating a widening gap between expert claims and real-world outcomes [5].

4. The populist backlash and the rise of the “counter-expert”  
•  When trust erodes, lay people turn to alternative authorities—Substack newsletters, podcasts and social-media influencers—sometimes labelled “podcast bros” by critics, but defended by others as a salutary check on complacent credentialism [10][11].  
•  An essay on “Elite Failures and Populist Backlash” argues that ordinary citizens are not merely anti-intellectual; they are reacting rationally to a long run of elite errors across foreign policy, finance, public health and higher education [2].

5. Is it only a perception crisis?  
•  Some commentators stress that the problem is less with knowledge itself than with how it is communicated and governed.  Lee and Macedo call for “humility, transparency and error-correction,” not a rejection of expertise per se [1].  
•  Ted Gioia’s “Ten Warning Signs” piece lists ways cultural institutions can reverse their slide—greater openness, methodological rigor, depoliticisation—implying that authority can be rebuilt if behaviour changes [14].  

6. Provisional conclusion  
Yes, we are living through a crisis of expertise: public trust has plummeted, elite failures are vivid and well-documented, and rival knowledge networks are proliferating.  Yet the crisis is not the extinction of expertise but a renegotiation of its social contract.  Experts remain necessary—nobody wants amateur surgeons or bridge builders—but must recover legitimacy by admitting uncertainty, policing their own ranks, and inviting genuine public scrutiny.  Whether today’s turbulence becomes a long-term breakdown or the prelude to a healthier, more accountable expert culture will depend on how institutions respond in the next few years.
