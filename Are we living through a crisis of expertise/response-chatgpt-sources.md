In recent years, many observers have warned that we are facing a “crisis of expertise” – a decline in the public’s trust in experts across fields such as science, medicine, economics, and governance. Examples often cited include populist political movements and misinformation campaigns where expert advice is dismissed or derided. For instance, during the 2016 Brexit campaign a leading proponent quipped, *“I think the people of this country have had enough of experts… saying that they know what is best and getting it consistently wrong”* – a statement that struck a chord with voters’ skepticism toward the claims of economists, scientists, and other authorities [1]. Similarly, American commentator Tom Nichols argues that people increasingly reject expert guidance as a way to assert their independence, even treating *“ignorance… as an actual virtue”* and equating *“to reject the advice of experts”* with personal autonomy from “nefarious elites” [2]. This *“death of expertise”* thesis holds that anti-intellectual attitudes, amplified by the internet’s leveling of information, have led many to question or overrule professionals in matters ranging from medical treatment to public policy, sometimes with harmful consequences [2]. In Nichols’ view, the erosion of respect for credentialed knowledge – combined with the ease of finding self-confirming information online – is undermining rational debate and decision-making in society [2]. 

There is certainly evidence of heightened skepticism toward experts. Controversies around climate change, vaccines, and other scientific issues often feature segments of the public dismissing the scientific consensus as biased or elitist. In the United States and elsewhere, trust in institutions and professions has become sharply polarized. People from different political camps may accuse scientists or other experts of having hidden agendas: for example, some on the left suspect researchers of being influenced by corporate interests or prejudices, while some on the right portray experts as ideologically driven technocrats [3]. High-profile expert failures and mixed messages – such as economists failing to predict financial crises or public health authorities changing guidelines during a pandemic – have further fueled public wariness. When experts are perceived to have been “consistently wrong,” as Michael Gove suggested, it validates the feeling that expert opinion might be no more reliable than lay opinion in certain cases [1]. Moreover, the democratization of knowledge access means that anyone can Google information or join online communities that bolster their own beliefs, undermining the traditional gatekeeping role of expert institutions. These trends contribute to a sense that expertise is “under siege” in the public square.

However, the notion of an absolute *collapse* in trust may be overstated. Surveys do **not** show a universal loss of faith in expertise or science across the board. In fact, longitudinal data (e.g. the General Social Survey in the U.S.) indicate that public confidence in the scientific community has remained robust over time [3]. Americans today express more trust in scientists than in almost any other societal institution except the military [3]. Fields like medicine and education have seen modest declines in public confidence over the decades, yet they are still held in higher esteem than institutions such as government, the media, or big business [3]. Globally as well, most people continue to value scientific knowledge and expert guidance in principle. For example, confidence in the benefits of science has slightly **increased** since the 1990s in the U.S., and Americans tend to have *more* faith in science than the publics of many other countries [3]. This suggests that we are not witnessing a wholesale rejection of expertise or science itself. Rather, people still generally trust experts *in the abstract* and appreciate the need for expert knowledge – a fact often obscured by the loud public conflicts over specific issues.

Sociologists and analysts argue that what we are experiencing is a more nuanced crisis **of legitimacy**, not a simple anti-expert revolt. Gil Eyal, who studies the relationship between knowledge and power, describes today’s situation as a “pushmi-pullyu” dynamic of **unprecedented reliance** on expert knowledge *alongside* heightened skepticism and scrutiny [4]. Modern societies depend on experts more than ever to navigate complex, high-stakes problems. Yet precisely because expert advice now heavily influences policies and impacts everyday life, it has become more politicized – subject to questioning and contestation from various publics. Eyal notes that the increasing “*scientization* of politics” (i.e. using scientific expertise to guide policy) has provoked a corresponding “*politicization* of science,” wherein scientific findings and expert pronouncements are frequently entangled with political identities and agendas [4]. These two processes feed into each other in a *“recursive crisis of legitimacy”* – a cycle in which experts’ authority is continually challenged even as we continue to depend on their knowledge [4]. In other words, the public’s skepticism is not simply born of ignorance; it is also a reaction to the real power that experts wield in shaping policy and society. Questions of **who gets to be considered an expert**, **how much deference they should be given**, and **who holds them accountable when they err** are at the heart of this crisis [3]. Healthy debate over these questions can be beneficial, up to a point. Eyal and others suggest that some degree of pushback against experts – asking for justification, considering alternative viewpoints – is *“natural and appropriate”* given that experts are fallible humans with their own biases and interests [3]. Such pushback can even improve science and policymaking, by forcing experts to recalibrate or explain their claims more clearly.

The predicament, then, is that we both **need** experts and **distrust** them in certain contexts. Are we truly living through a “crisis of expertise”? Many scholars would answer **yes**, but they stress that it’s a complex crisis. It manifests in high-profile clashes (like populist politicians rallying against academic elites, or segments of the public refusing vaccines despite medical advice) that create the impression of wholesale anti-scientific sentiment. These clashes are real and concerning – they expose how misinformation, populist rhetoric, and resentment toward “elitism” can erode the public’s willingness to heed expert counsel. Indeed, commentators like Nichols warn that if disregard for expertise becomes commonplace, society risks making disastrous decisions in areas like public health, the environment, and national security [2]. At the same time, beneath the noisy conflicts, general respect for expertise lurks in how people still fly on airplanes designed by engineers, take medications tested by medical experts, and use technology built by specialists. The “crisis” is less about people abandoning expert knowledge entirely, and more about **redefining** the relationship between experts and the public. In this redefinition, accountability and transparency are key: experts must communicate clearly, acknowledge uncertainties, and avoid the perception of overstepping into political advocacy, while citizens must remain open to credible evidence even when it challenges their preconceptions. 

In conclusion, we are indeed in a fraught period for expertise, marked by tension and recalibration rather than total collapse. The phrase “crisis of expertise” captures genuine challenges – visible in the skepticism toward expert pronouncements on pressing issues and the ease with which falsehoods can spread – but it also risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy if we paint the situation too bleakly. A more accurate view is that society is renegotiating **how** expertise earns trust and authority. Experts are under the microscope, expected to prove their legitimacy in the public eye, while large segments of the public are learning (sometimes painfully) that not all “alternative facts” are equal. Whether this era will ultimately undermine expert authority or lead to a healthier, more dialogic interplay between experts and citizens depends on how both sides respond. If experts engage with the public humbly and transparently, and if the public learns to balance healthy skepticism with respect for specialized knowledge, the current “crisis” can be overcome. In the meantime, it’s clear that complacency is no option – both experts and laypeople must actively work to rebuild trust, combat misinformation, and reaffirm why, despite its imperfections, expertise remains indispensable in tackling the complex problems of modern life.

However, he highlights a paradox: overall faith in science coexists with intense polarization over specific issues (climate change, vaccines, etc.), where people question experts’ motives. The article, drawing on sociologist Gil Eyal’s work, suggests reframing the problem: rather than simply bemoaning public ignorance, we should study how expert authority is built, maintained, and contested in society. *Source:* [Heterodox Academy – *The Crisis of Expertise*](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/social-science-crisis-expertise/) 

4. **Gil Eyal (2019)** – *The Crisis of Expertise* (Polity Press book summary via Columbia University). Eyal, a sociologist, argues that we are not witnessing a one-dimensional “assault on science,” but a dual phenomenon of **increased reliance** on experts alongside **increased skepticism**. He describes a *“recursive crisis of legitimacy”* wherein the growing use of scientific experts in policymaking (the *scientization of politics*) provokes greater political contestation of science itself. This feedback loop leads to an unstable mix of authority and doubt. Eyal’s view is that the “crisis of expertise” is fundamentally about struggles over the *role* of experts – who is considered an expert, how much influence they should have, and how to ensure their accountability – rather than a wholesale rejection of knowledge. *Source:* [Columbia News – *The Crisis of Expertise* (Book announcement)](https://news.columbia.edu/content/crisis-expertise)
