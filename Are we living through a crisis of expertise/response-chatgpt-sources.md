Are we living through a crisis of expertise?

1. What “crisis of expertise” means  
   A crisis of expertise is not the disappearance of experts, but a pronounced and widening gap between credentialed authorities and the public’s willingness to trust, defer to, or even listen to them.  It shows up as collapsing confidence in public bodies, repeated high-profile failures or scandals inside expert communities, and the rapid growth of alternative information channels that openly compete with established authorities.

2. Indicators that a crisis is under way  

   a. A collapse in public trust  
      • Only 16 % of Americans today say they trust Washington “just about always” or “most of the time,” down from 77 % in 1964 and hovering near the lowest level ever recorded (Pew Research Center, 2024).  
      • News organizations that once saw themselves as gate-keepers of reliable information are losing their audiences’ confidence; even longtime insiders warn that outlets such as NPR have “lost America’s trust” by mixing reporting with activism (The FP, 2024).

   b. Visible expert failure and misconduct  
      • Covid-19 produced contradictory public-health guidance, rapidly shifting mask and school-closing rules, and a “technocratic myopia” that ignored ordinary citizens’ trade-offs, say political scientists Frances Lee and Stephen Macedo; the result was a “massive hit to the authority of experts” (Lee & Macedo 2025).  
      • Macroeconomists concede that their models failed to foresee either the low-inflation 2010s or the high-inflation spike of 2021-22; “economists don’t know what’s going on,” The Economist concludes (Economist 2025).  
      • A literature-wide replication effort in biomedicine found that only 46 % of highly-cited papers could be reproduced (Vilhelmsson et al., 2023, PMC10581498).  Vox reports that outright scientific fraud is now common enough that some scholars call for criminal penalties (Vox 2024).  Harvard’s unprecedented revocation of a tenured professor after data-fabrication findings dramatizes the point (WGBH 2025).

   c. Digital empowerment of the public  
      • Martin Gurri argues that the internet has “leveled every hierarchy” and allows the crowd to scrutinize, mock and bypass elites in real time, creating a “crisis of authority” across the board (Gurri 2018).  
      • This dynamic fuels what Conspicuous Cognition calls an “elite failure/populist backlash cycle,” where each blunder by credentialed insiders spreads instantly online and intensifies distrust (Conspicuous Cognition 2024).  
      • Alternative voices—the “podcast bros,” Substack writers, and social-media sleuths—flourish precisely because audiences feel they are getting unfiltered analysis rather than institutional talking points (NCOFNas 2024).

3. Objections: is it merely a perception problem?  
   • Some commentators caution that expertise itself mostly works; airplanes stay aloft and mRNA vaccines were developed in record time.  The better term might be “crisis of authority,” not of knowledge.  
   • Yet perception quickly becomes reality when collective action depends on trust.  The public’s willingness to vaccinate, invest, or accept economic policy depends less on raw technical correctness and more on whether they believe the people issuing instructions.

4. Sources of the crisis  
   • Increasing complexity makes expert mistakes inevitable and highly visible.  
   • Politicization: when scientific agencies issue statements that track partisan lines, citizens interpret them as political actors rather than neutral experts (Lee & Macedo 2025; The FP 2024).  
   • Lack of accountability: elite professions often close ranks, reinforcing the sense that “the system is rigged” until a spectacular scandal, such as the Harvard case, explodes.  
   • Information glut: as Gurri notes, the sheer volume of data lets amateurs catch expert errors, but also lets misinformation thrive (Gurri 2018).

5. Consequences  
   • Governance becomes harder; every policy faces immediate skepticism and organized online opposition.  
   • Populist movements portray elites as self-serving, further eroding institutional legitimacy.  
   • Expertise gets fragmented: people curate their own preferred authorities, leading to epistemic balkanization.

6. What might rebuild trust?  
   • Radical transparency: share data, code, and uncertainty ranges so outsiders can audit claims.  
   • Humility and error-correction: admit mistakes quickly and publicly (Honest Broker 2024).  
   • Separate expertise from partisanship: keep core technical bodies visibly independent.  
   • Open channels for informed non-experts; as Aporia argues, laypeople can supply local knowledge and valuable dissent that keeps experts honest (Aporia 2024).

7. Conclusion  
   By every measurable indicator—public-opinion data, high-profile failures, and the rise of alternative information ecosystems—we are indeed living through a crisis of expertise.  It is less a collapse of knowledge than a collapse of authority and trust.  Whether societies can regain a workable relationship with expertise will depend on how convincingly institutions reform themselves and how willing experts are to embrace transparency, accountability, and humility.
