Based on the available evidence, we appear to be experiencing a significant crisis of expertise characterized by declining public trust in institutions, documented failures of expert predictions and recommendations, and systemic problems within expert communities themselves.

## Declining Public Trust

The erosion of trust in expertise is well-documented. According to Pew Research, public trust in government has declined dramatically since the 1950s, with only about 20% of Americans saying they trust the government to do what is right most of the time [1]. This represents a precipitous fall from the 70%+ levels seen in the early 1960s.

The COVID-19 pandemic served as a particularly revealing stress test for expert authority. Frances Lee and Stephen Macedo argue that institutional failures during the pandemic - including inconsistent messaging, policy reversals, and politically motivated recommendations - significantly undermined public confidence in expert guidance [2]. The handling of issues like mask mandates, school closures, and the lab leak hypothesis demonstrated how expert recommendations could be influenced by political considerations rather than purely scientific evidence.

## Expert Failures and Predictive Accuracy

Multiple domains show concerning patterns of expert failure. In economics, recent analyses highlight how professional economists consistently fail to predict major economic events and trends [3][4]. The profession's track record includes missing the 2008 financial crisis, consistently inaccurate inflation predictions, and fundamental disagreements about basic economic relationships.

The scientific research enterprise faces its own credibility crisis. Studies suggest that a significant proportion of published research findings may be false, with particular problems in psychology and other social sciences [5]. Research fraud cases are becoming more prominent, including recent high-profile cases like Harvard's revocation of tenure for a business professor found guilty of data manipulation [6].

## Structural Problems in Expert Communities

Several structural issues contribute to the crisis of expertise. The academic and policy expert communities often operate in ideologically homogeneous environments that can lead to groupthink and blind spots. A former NPR editor's account of how the organization "lost America's trust" illustrates how media institutions became captured by particular political perspectives, undermining their credibility as neutral arbiters of information [7].

The phenomenon described as "elite failures and populist backlash" suggests a cycle where expert failures fuel public skepticism, which in turn leads to rejection of legitimate expertise [8]. This creates a feedback loop where declining trust makes it harder for experts to effectively communicate, further eroding their authority.

## The Information Ecosystem Crisis

The crisis extends beyond traditional experts to the broader information ecosystem. The rise of "podcast bros" and alternative media sources reflects public hunger for information sources outside traditional expert channels, though this brings its own risks of misinformation and oversimplification [9]. Traditional media institutions like The New York Times face criticism for abandoning journalistic objectivity in favor of advocacy [10].

The proliferation of information sources makes it increasingly difficult for the public to distinguish reliable from unreliable expertise. As one Wall Street Journal analysis notes, the question "Can You Trust Anybody?" reflects a broader crisis of authority in the digital age [11].

## Coordination Problems and Systemic Issues

Recent analysis suggests that many expert failures stem from coordination problems within expert communities [12]. Smart people may recognize problems but lack incentives to speak out against prevailing orthodoxies, leading to collective silence on important issues. This creates environments where flawed ideas can persist unchallenged within expert communities.

## The Defense of Non-Expert Perspectives

Some argue that the crisis of expertise has revealed the value of non-expert perspectives that were previously dismissed. The defense of "non-experts" suggests that domain outsiders sometimes provide valuable insights that credentialed experts miss due to professional blind spots or institutional constraints [13].

## Conclusion

The evidence suggests we are indeed living through a crisis of expertise, but this crisis has multiple dimensions. It involves both legitimate failures of expert institutions and communities, as well as broader societal challenges in navigating an increasingly complex information environment. The crisis appears to be both a cause and consequence of declining social trust, creating challenges for democratic governance and evidence-based policymaking.

The path forward likely requires reforms within expert communities to improve accountability and predictive accuracy, while also developing better mechanisms for the public to evaluate and engage with expert knowledge in a more sophisticated way.
