# Are we living through a crisis of expertise?

Based on the available evidence, we do appear to be living through a significant crisis of expertise, characterized by declining public trust in institutions, documented failures of expert predictions and policies, and structural problems within knowledge-producing institutions themselves.

## The Evidence for Declining Trust

Public trust in government has reached historic lows, with Pew Research Center data showing a dramatic decline from the late 1950s to 2024 [1]. This erosion of trust extends beyond government to include traditional media institutions, with former NPR editor Uri Berliner documenting how the organization "lost America's trust" through partisan coverage and ideological capture [2]. Similarly, The Economist has analyzed how major media outlets like The New York Times have "lost their way" [3], while broader questions about institutional trustworthiness have become commonplace [4].

## Institutional and Expert Failures

The COVID-19 pandemic provided a particularly stark example of institutional failure. Frances Lee and Stephen Macedo's analysis reveals how institutions failed during this critical period, contributing to a broader crisis of authority [5]. This represents part of what Martin Gurri describes as "The Revolt of the Public," where traditional authority structures face unprecedented challenges in the digital age [6].

Economic expertise has faced particular scrutiny, with documented failures in prediction and policy recommendations [7]. Even The Economist has acknowledged that "economists don't know what's going on" [8], highlighting fundamental limitations in a field that heavily influences public policy.

## Problems in Knowledge Production

The crisis extends to the foundations of expertise itself. Scientific research faces serious integrity issues, with documented cases of fraud leading to discussions about criminal prosecution [9]. More fundamentally, research in psychology shows troubling trends in statistical power and publication bias, raising questions about whether most published research findings are false [10].

High-profile academic scandals, such as Harvard's rare decision to revoke tenure from a star business professor [11], illustrate how even elite institutions struggle with credibility issues.

## The Populist Response and Alternative Information Sources

Elite failures have contributed to populist backlash movements that explicitly reject traditional expertise [12]. This has coincided with the rise of alternative information sources, including what some critics call "podcast bros and brain rot" [13], representing a fragmentation of the information ecosystem.

However, some defend this democratization of knowledge, arguing for "the defence of non-experts" [14] and suggesting that traditional gatekeepers may have lost their claim to exclusive authority.

## Historical Context and Lessons

The Iraq War provides an instructive historical parallel, demonstrating how expert consensus can be fundamentally wrong with devastating consequences [15]. Such failures contribute to longer-term skepticism about expert judgment and institutional competence.

## Structural Warning Signs

Contemporary observers have identified multiple "warning signs" [16] of institutional decay and credibility loss across various domains of expertise, suggesting this is not merely a temporary crisis but a deeper structural problem.

While some level of skepticism toward expertise may be healthy in a democratic society, the current crisis appears to go beyond normal democratic accountability. The combination of documented expert failures, institutional capture, problems in knowledge production, and the rise of alternative information sources suggests we are indeed experiencing a profound crisis of expertise that poses significant challenges for governance and public discourse.
