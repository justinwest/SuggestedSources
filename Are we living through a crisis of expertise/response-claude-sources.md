Yes, there is substantial evidence that we are living through a profound crisis of expertise, characterized by declining public trust in institutions, documented failures across multiple expert domains, and fundamental questions about how knowledge and authority function in democratic societies.

## The Scope of Declining Trust

Public trust in government has plummeted dramatically over the past six decades. According to Pew Research, trust in government fell from around 75% in the late 1950s to just 22% by 2024 [1]. This erosion extends beyond government to encompass universities, media organizations, and scientific institutions. The decline isn't merely about political polarization—it reflects deeper skepticism about the competence and integrity of expert classes across society.

## Institutional and Expert Failures

The COVID-19 pandemic serves as a crucial case study in institutional failure. Frances Lee and Stephen Macedo argue that institutions failed during COVID not just due to external pressures, but because of internal coordination problems and the inability to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances [2]. These failures weren't isolated incidents but part of a broader pattern of expert misjudgments.

Economic expertise has faced particular scrutiny. Economists have struggled with persistent forecasting failures and an apparent disconnect from economic realities affecting ordinary people [3][4]. The profession's inability to predict major economic disruptions or provide reliable guidance during crises has undermined confidence in economic expertise more broadly.

The scientific enterprise itself faces credibility challenges. Research fraud cases are increasingly prosecuted criminally [5], while meta-analyses suggest that many published research findings may be false due to methodological issues, publication bias, and the structure of academic incentives [6]. These problems raise fundamental questions about the reliability of the knowledge production system that underpins expert authority.

## Media and Information Systems

Traditional media institutions have lost significant credibility. A 25-year NPR veteran describes how the organization lost America's trust through ideological capture and departure from journalistic neutrality [7]. Similar critiques have been leveled at prestigious outlets like The New York Times, which faces accusations of abandoning objectivity for advocacy [8]. This media crisis compounds the expertise problem by undermining the institutions that traditionally mediated between experts and the public.

Meanwhile, alternative information sources like podcasts and social media influencers have gained prominence, though these often lack traditional editorial standards and fact-checking mechanisms [9]. This creates a fragmented information landscape where expertise competes with entertainment and confirmation bias.

## Structural and Systemic Issues

The crisis appears to have deep structural roots. Martin Gurri's analysis suggests we're experiencing a fundamental "revolt of the public" against traditional authority structures, enabled by information technology that has democratized access to information while fragmenting consensus [10]. Smart, credentialed individuals increasingly make poor decisions due to coordination problems and institutional incentives that reward conformity over accuracy [11].

Some analysts argue the crisis is fundamentally about status and class dynamics rather than technical competence per se [12][13]. Elite institutions may be failing not because experts lack knowledge, but because they've become disconnected from the concerns and values of broader society, creating a legitimacy gap that technical expertise alone cannot bridge.

## The Competence Dimension

Beyond trust issues, there are concerns about actual declining competence within expert institutions. Some observers warn of a "competence crisis" where complex systems are increasingly managed by individuals who lack the practical skills and institutional knowledge needed to maintain them effectively [14]. This suggests the problem isn't just public perception but may reflect real deterioration in institutional capabilities.

## Defending Expertise

Not all observers agree that the crisis is primarily the fault of experts themselves. Some argue that non-experts deserve more credit for their practical knowledge and common sense, suggesting the problem may be excessive deference to credentialed expertise rather than expertise per se [15]. Others contend that while expert failures are real, the alternative—populist rejection of expertise altogether—poses even greater dangers to complex modern societies.

## Conclusion

The evidence suggests we are indeed experiencing a multifaceted crisis of expertise involving declining trust, documented institutional failures, structural problems in knowledge production, and fundamental questions about authority in democratic societies. This crisis reflects both real expert failures and broader social and technological changes that have altered how knowledge and authority function. Whether this represents a necessary correction of excessive expert authority or a dangerous erosion of institutional capacity—or both—remains an open question with profound implications for governance and society.
