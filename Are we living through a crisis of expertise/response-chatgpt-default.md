Many observers suggest that **yes – we are living through a “crisis of expertise.”** This phrase refers to a widespread erosion of public trust in experts and professional knowledge. Commentators like Tom Nichols argue that society is experiencing a *“death of expertise”* – a rejection of expert authority in favor of personal beliefs or internet-fueled misinformation [1]. Nichols notes that many people now confidently rely on quick Google or Wikipedia information and **treat “mastery and wisdom” as irrelevant, a trend that gives cover to “corrosive ignorance”** [1]. In other words, people increasingly feel **“we’re all experts”**, and they dismiss the value of trained specialists. This attitude is often framed as a populist rebellion against elitism, but it can lead to public debates where evidence and expert analysis are ignored or shouted down by opinion and emotion ([www.beyondintractability.org](https://www.beyondintractability.org/artsum-cci/Nichols-expertise/#:~:text=These%20incidents%20are%20not%20exceptions,the%20death%20of%20expertise%20itself)) ([comment.org](https://comment.org/the-death-of-expertise-as-a-decline-of-trust/#:~:text=But%20that%20is%20a%20world,debates%20about%20populism%20and%20policy)). Recent events lend credence to the idea of an expertise crisis: **from segments of the public denying scientific consensus on vaccines or climate change, to widespread acceptance of conspiracy theories over expert advice**. These patterns highlight a growing gap between experts and portions of the public.

Empirical data also show signs of declining trust in experts. **Surveys in the U.S. and elsewhere indicate that confidence in scientific and medical authorities has fallen in recent years.** For example, a Pew Research Center study found that the share of Americans expressing a high level of confidence in scientists **dropped from about 87% at the start of 2020 to around 73% in 2023** [2]. This decline was especially sharp among certain groups during the COVID-19 pandemic – **the proportion of Republicans with low trust in scientists roughly tripled (from 14% to 38%)** over that period [2]. While a majority still trusts experts generally, **the overall trend is downward**, and trust has become more **politically polarized** ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/11/14/pandemic-trust-in-science-eroded-pew/#:~:text=When%20Pew%20conducted%20such%20a,73%20percent%20in%20October%202023)) ([www.pewresearch.org](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/11/14/americans-trust-in-scientists-positive-views-of-science-continue-to-decline/#:~:text=match%20at%20L125%20over%20the,of%20this%20shift%20occurred%20during)). Similar skepticism is evident in other domains: public health officials, climate scientists, economists, and other experts have all seen sections of the public question their credibility and even outright reject their recommendations. High-profile mistakes or conflicting messages (as happened early in the pandemic) can amplify this distrust. **In short, many people today are less inclined to defer to expert authority than in the past, fueling the perception of a crisis in expertise.**

**Why is this happening?** Analysts have proposed a variety of explanations for the decline in trust and the **“crisis of expertise.”** These factors are often intertwined:

- **Information Glut and the Internet:** The digital age has democratized information, allowing anyone with a smartphone to access facts (or falsehoods). Nichols and others argue this creates an *illusion of knowledge* – people feel as informed as experts after a quick web search, undermining respect for genuine expertise ([www.foreignaffairs.com](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-02-13/how-america-lost-faith-expertise?cid=soc-fb-rdr#:~:text=Ask%20an%20expert%20about%20the,a%20limitless%20supply%20of%20facts)) ([www.foreignaffairs.com](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-02-13/how-america-lost-faith-expertise?cid=soc-fb-rdr#:~:text=But%20facts%20are%20not%20the,edifying%20sources%20of%20good%20information)). In effect, **“Google-fueled amateurs” believe they know as much as specialists** [1]. This **“dumbing down” effect**, combined with mass access to higher education, has blurred the lines between expert and layperson in the public mind [3].

- **Erosion of Institutional Trust:** Broader social trends play a role. Political scientist Daniel Drezner contends that rising inequality and elitism have fostered general distrust toward **“established authorities”**, including experts [3]. When people feel left behind or suspect that elites serve only their own interests, they become skeptical of the knowledge those elites produce. Scandals or errors among professional authorities (e.g. financial experts missing the 2008 crash) also **dent the credibility of expert institutions**.

- **Relativism and Culture:** Some point to intellectual currents that question the very idea of objective truth. **Postmodernist and relativist philosophies**, which gained influence in academia, can filter into popular culture and erode confidence that experts are truly *“right”* about facts [4]. Psychologically, many individuals also rely on intuition or traditional beliefs. Studies find that **“magical thinking” and conspiracy theories** are surprisingly common even in advanced societies, and these mindsets clash with scientific expertise [5]. People with such views may see expert consensus as “just another opinion” or even a cover-up, rather than a reflection of reality.

- **Politicization of Knowledge:** **Many controversies around expertise arise because scientific findings have political or economic consequences.** In areas like climate change, vaccines, or public health, accepting expert guidance often implies support for policies that some groups oppose. This entangles science with ideology. **Experts may be viewed as biased or agenda-driven** if their advice could lead to regulations or social changes that threaten certain values or interests ([heterodoxacademy.org](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/social-science-crisis-expertise/#:~:text=That%20is%2C%20Americans%20tend%20to,faith%20in%20science%20and%20the)) ([heterodoxacademy.org](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/social-science-crisis-expertise/#:~:text=and%20publics,something%20that%20should%20be%20expected)). Partisans on both left and right accuse experts of *“having an agenda”* when research conclusions conflict with their political beliefs ([heterodoxacademy.org](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/social-science-crisis-expertise/#:~:text=That%20is%2C%20Americans%20tend%20to,faith%20in%20science%20and%20the)). Thus, polarization feeds distrust: people tend to reject expert claims that contradict their partisan identity or economic interests.

- **Deliberate Disinformation:** A **cynical but real factor** is that organized campaigns have actively undermined public trust in expert knowledge. Historian Naomi Oreskes and others have documented how industries and lobby groups **sow doubt about scientific consensus** to protect their own interests [6]. Famous examples include the tobacco industry casting uncertainty on smoking’s dangers and fossil-fuel interests challenging climate science. **These “merchants of doubt” use media and **fake experts** to blur the lines, making the public question well-established expert conclusions ([www.scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/cross-check/merchants-of-doubt-author-slams-corrosive-climate-change-skepticism/#:~:text=,efforts%20on%20tobacco%2C%20not%20Derrida)) ([www.scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/cross-check/merchants-of-doubt-author-slams-corrosive-climate-change-skepticism/#:~:text=Erik%20Conway%20of%20Caltech,ozone%20hole%20and%20global%20warming)). Over decades, such efforts have had a corrosive effect on trust – if people hear constant conflicting claims, they may stop believing *any* experts at all.

Not everyone agrees that the situation is an outright *collapse* of trust in expertise. **Some evidence suggests a more nuanced picture.** For instance, surveys show that science and experts are still held in high regard relative to many other institutions – in the U.S., **the scientific community remains one of the most trusted institutions (second only to the military)**, even if trust has declined slightly ([heterodoxacademy.org](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/social-science-crisis-expertise/#:~:text=there%20has%20been%20no%20radical,the%20scientific%20community%20per%20se)). Sociologist Gil Eyal argues that **what looks like a “crisis of expertise” is a two-sided phenomenon** rather than a universal rejection of experts [7]. He describes it as a *“pushmi-pullyu”* dynamic: **society relies on expert knowledge more than ever, yet at the same time people are more suspicious and critical of experts’ claims** [7]. In Eyal’s view, there is no simple “war on all science” – the distrust is focused mainly on **“regulatory” or policy-linked sciences**, where expert advice directly informs public policy (e.g. epidemiology, climate science, economics) [7]. Fields of science that stay in the lab or have no political impact are not under the same level of attack. **This implies that the conflict often arises where expert knowledge intersects with people’s lives and interests.** Who gets to be considered an expert, and how much influence they should have over policy, becomes hotly contested ([heterodoxacademy.org](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/social-science-crisis-expertise/#:~:text=The%20crisis%20of%20expertise%2C%20then%2C,of%20struggles%20over%20questions%20like)). Eyal and others note that skepticism toward experts can sometimes be **“natural and appropriate”** – especially when **decisions are high-stakes, expert predictions have uncertainties, or experts have made visible mistakes in the past** ([heterodoxacademy.org](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/social-science-crisis-expertise/#:~:text=As%20Eyal%20points%20out%2C%20given,something%20that%20should%20be%20expected)). In fact, a healthy scientific process *encourages* scrutiny and debate. From this perspective, **some level of public distrust is a corrective force** against technocratic overreach, pushing experts to explain themselves better and to be accountable [7]. 

**So, are we in a crisis of expertise?** By most accounts, **we are witnessing a real and worrying decline in the public’s willingness to trust experts**, with serious implications. When large segments of society reject expert guidance – on vaccines, climate change, public health, or other critical issues – it **becomes harder to solve collective problems**, and misinformation can flourish. Nichols warns that a world where everyone’s opinion is treated as equally valid can “[give] cover to corrosive ignorance,” ultimately harming society [1]. Indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic showed how distrust in expertise can translate into **resistance to health measures, spread of false cures, and higher death tolls**. At the same time, it’s important to recognize that this “crisis” is not absolute: people still rely on doctors, engineers, and other experts in many areas of daily life, and overall scientific progress continues. **The challenge lies in bridging the gap between experts and the public**. To address the expertise crisis, experts and institutions may need to **earn back trust** – by communicating more clearly, acknowledging uncertainties, and engaging with the public’s concerns ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/jan/27/a-crisis-of-trust-is-looming-between-scientists-and-society-its-time-to-talk#:~:text=Self,is%20where%20the%20problem%20lurks)) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/11/14/pandemic-trust-in-science-eroded-pew/#:~:text=Americans%20give%20research%20scientists%20fairly,%E2%80%9D)). In summary, **we are living through a moment of serious *tension* between expert knowledge and public perception**. The erosion of trust in expertise is real, driven by multiple factors, and it demands attention because **society runs on expert input – and losing that foundation is indeed a crisis** [1].

3. **Daniel Drezner (2017)** – *The Ideas Industry (and commentary on expert trust)*. Drezner suggests that the so-called crisis of expertise is tied to a broader **erosion of trust in institutions**, exacerbated by rising inequality. As disparities grow, the public becomes more cynical about **“established authorities,”** including experts, viewing them as distant elites not serving ordinary people’s interests. This skepticism toward the *“expert class”* is part of a populist backlash against all elites. Drezner sees the decline in trust as partly rooted in these socio-economic trends that make people less willing to defer to credentialed experts. *Source: Analysis summarized in Federico Brandmayr (2021), citing Drezner.* [^](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1368431020910298)

Pinker and others have argued that **intellectual trends like postmodernism** contributed to the expertise crisis by undermining the notion of objective truth. He points out that decades of academic relativism – where truths are seen as subjective or socially constructed – have inadvertently **legitimized public skepticism toward scientific facts**. In this view, the spread of *“anything goes”* relativism from campus to culture has made it easier for people to dismiss experts, since all knowledge is seen as just another “narrative.” Pinker sees this as one factor enabling today’s “post-truth” mindset, where **scientific evidence can be rejected as just one opinion**. *Source: Interpretation based on Pinker’s commentary (summarized in Brandmayr 2021).* [^](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1368431020910298)

These political scientists note that a large segment of the public holds **irrational or pseudoscientific beliefs** – for example, belief in conspiracy theories, astrology, or other forms of magical thinking. In their book *Enchanted America*, they argue such **intuitionist thinking** makes people **distrust scientific experts** who contradict those beliefs. This cultural backdrop means that even in modern societies, many individuals are predisposed to be skeptical of expert knowledge, favoring folk wisdom or conspiratorial explanations instead. Oliver & Wood see this enduring popularity of *“magical beliefs”* as one contributor to the crisis of expertise, especially when coupled with uncertainty or social stress ([journals.sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1368431020910298?icid=int.sj-full-text.similar-articles.9#:~:text=authorities%2C%20exacerbated%20by%20increasing%20inequality,part%20reflect%20a%20healthy%20reaction)). *Source: Their research as summarized by Brandmayr (2021).* [^](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1368431020910298) 

6. **Naomi Oreskes & Erik Conway (2010)** – *Merchants of Doubt*. Oreskes and Conway document how **deliberate disinformation campaigns** have undermined public trust in expert science. They show that **industries and political groups strategically sow doubt** about scientific findings to prevent policy action – for example, tobacco companies casting uncertainty on smoking’s harms, or oil lobbyists questioning climate change. This *“manufactured doubt”* strategy, often amplified by compliant media, has **“skewed public understanding”** of many issues ([www.scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/cross-check/merchants-of-doubt-author-slams-corrosive-climate-change-skepticism/#:~:text=Erik%20Conway%20of%20Caltech,ozone%20hole%20and%20global%20warming)). As a result, the public becomes unsure what to believe and grows suspicious of official experts (seeing them as possibly biased or wrong). Oreskes argues that this corrosive skepticism is *intentional*, and it significantly contributes to the current crisis of expertise by eroding the credibility of science in the public eye ([www.scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/cross-check/merchants-of-doubt-author-slams-corrosive-climate-change-skepticism/#:~:text=,efforts%20on%20tobacco%2C%20not%20Derrida)). *Source: *Merchants of Doubt* (book) and interviews.* [^](https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/cross-check/merchants-of-doubt-author-slams-corrosive-climate-change-skepticism/)

7. **Gil Eyal (2019)** – *The Crisis of Expertise (sociological perspective)*. Eyal offers a nuanced view: he agrees there is heightened public skepticism of experts, but he emphasizes that **society also depends on expertise more than ever**. He describes a **“two-headed pushmi-pullyu”** situation – an unprecedented reliance on expert knowledge *alongside* increased suspicion of that knowledge [7]. According to Eyal, the conflict is most intense in areas where science meets policy (“regulatory science”), and it raises questions about ** who qualifies as an expert and how experts should interact with democracy** ([heterodoxacademy.org](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/social-science-crisis-expertise/#:~:text=The%20crisis%20of%20expertise%2C%20then%2C,of%20struggles%20over%20questions%20like)). Importantly, Eyal notes that some skepticism is **justified and inevitable**. Given the complexity of modern problems and the fact that experts can err, public **questioning of expert claims can be a “natural and appropriate” reaction** in certain cases ([heterodoxacademy.org](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/social-science-crisis-expertise/#:~:text=As%20Eyal%20points%20out%2C%20given,something%20that%20should%20be%20expected)). Rather than a straightforward war on expertise, Eyal sees the current moment as a call to **redefine the social contract between experts and the public**, improving transparency, accountability, and public engagement to rebuild trust. *Source: Eyal’s analysis (2019), as cited by Musa al-Gharbi (2020).* [^](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/social-science-crisis-expertise/)
