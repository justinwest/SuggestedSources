### Introduction

The question of whether we are living through a crisis of expertise has gained prominence in recent years, fueled by events like the COVID-19 pandemic, economic upheavals, and political polarization. Expertise refers to the specialized knowledge and authority held by professionals in fields such as science, medicine, economics, journalism, and governance. A "crisis" in this context implies widespread failures, declining public trust, and challenges to the legitimacy of these experts. Drawing from the provided sources, there is substantial evidence suggesting yes, we are experiencing such a crisis, characterized by institutional failures, eroded trust, and systemic issues like fraud and bias. However, some perspectives offer nuance, arguing that the problem lies not with expertise itself but with how it is coordinated, communicated, or challenged by non-experts. This response examines the evidence for and against a crisis, focusing on key domains like government institutions, science, economics, and media.

### Evidence of a Crisis of Expertise

#### Institutional and Governmental Failures
Public trust in government and institutions has plummeted, indicating a broader crisis of authority. According to Pew Research data, only about 20% of Americans trusted the federal government in 2024, down from highs of over 70% in the 1960s [1]. This decline correlates with perceived failures during crises like COVID-19, where experts and institutions provided inconsistent guidance on masks, lockdowns, and vaccines, leading to public confusion and backlash [2]. Frances Lee and Stephen Macedo argue that these institutional shortcomings—such as bureaucratic inertia and politicization—exacerbated the pandemic's impact, eroding faith in expert-led governance [3]. Similarly, Martin Gurri's book *The Revolt of the Public* describes a "crisis of authority" in the digital age, where information abundance empowers publics to challenge elite narratives, amplifying populist revolts against perceived expert incompetence [4].

#### Failures in Economics
Economists have faced criticism for failing to predict or manage major events like the 2008 financial crisis and post-pandemic inflation. A piece in *The Economist* notes that economists are increasingly admitting uncertainty, with models failing to account for real-world complexities like supply chain disruptions [5]. Another analysis highlights how economists' overconfidence in neoliberal policies contributed to inequality and backlash, labeling it a "failure of economists" to deliver on promises of prosperity [6]. These shortcomings have fueled populist sentiments, as elites are seen as out of touch with ordinary people's economic realities [7].

#### Scientific and Academic Integrity Issues
Science, often viewed as the pinnacle of expertise, is grappling with reproducibility crises and fraud. A study in psychology found that a significant portion of published research may be false due to low statistical power and publication bias, with false discovery rates potentially exceeding 50% in some periods [8]. High-profile cases, such as Harvard revoking tenure from a star business professor for data fabrication, underscore systemic problems in academia [9]. Vox reports on the rarity of criminal prosecutions for scientific fraud, suggesting that accountability mechanisms are weak, which erodes public confidence [10]. These issues extend to medicine, where COVID-19 exposed flaws in expert consensus, such as initial dismissals of lab-leak theories later deemed plausible [11].

#### Media and Journalistic Decline
Traditional media outlets, once gatekeepers of expert information, have lost credibility due to perceived bias and sensationalism. A former NPR editor revealed how the network's ideological slant alienated audiences, contributing to a broader loss of trust in journalism [12]. *The Economist* critiqued *The New York Times* for prioritizing advocacy over objectivity, alienating readers and fueling perceptions of elite media failure [13]. Ted Gioia's "Ten Warning Signs" outlines symptoms of this decline, including echo chambers and misinformation, which amplify distrust in expert-curated news [14]. The Wall Street Journal poses the question "Can You Trust Anybody?" in an era of AI deepfakes and influencer-driven narratives, highlighting how media failures intersect with broader expertise erosion [15].

These examples across domains illustrate a pattern: experts and institutions have made high-profile errors, leading to a populist backlash where non-experts, via social media and podcasts, challenge traditional authority [7][4]. This is compounded by coordination problems among smart people, where even well-intentioned experts fail due to groupthink or misaligned incentives [16].

### Counterarguments and Nuances
Not all sources view this as an unmitigated crisis. Some defend expertise while critiquing anti-expert populism. For instance, an article in *Aporia Magazine* argues "In Defence of Non-Experts," suggesting that while experts err, non-experts often amplify misinformation, and the real issue is over-deference to flawed authorities rather than a total crisis [17]. Nathan Cofnas critiques "Podcast Bros and Brain Rot," warning against dismissing expertise in favor of unqualified influencers, which could exacerbate societal problems [18]. The Last Psychiatrist reflects on Iraq War misjudgments, arguing that the "wrong lessons" are learned when blaming experts without addressing systemic media and political failures [19]. These views suggest the crisis may be one of perception and communication, not inherent to expertise itself. Additional research from the American Psychological Association supports this, noting that trust in science remains relatively high (around 70% in surveys), though polarized by politics [20].

### Conclusion
Overall, the evidence leans toward yes—we are living through a crisis of expertise, marked by declining trust, repeated failures, and challenges from digital populism [1][4][7]. This is evident in government mishandlings, economic mispredictions, scientific fraud, and media biases, which have collectively undermined public confidence. However, nuances exist: the crisis may stem from institutional flaws and poor coordination rather than expertise being inherently unreliable [16][17]. To mitigate this, reforms like better accountability, transparency, and public engagement could rebuild trust. Without them, the divide between experts and the public risks widening, with implications for democracy and decision-making.
