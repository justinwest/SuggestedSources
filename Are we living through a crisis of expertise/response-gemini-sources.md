Based on the provided sources, the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that we are living through a significant crisis of expertise. This crisis is not a simple matter of the public becoming irrational, but rather a complex phenomenon driven by repeated expert failures, the decay of institutions, the empowerment of the public through new technology, and underlying social and class tensions [2, 18, 19].

The crisis is characterized by a dramatic and decades-long decline in public trust. According to the Pew Research Center, public trust in the federal government has collapsed from over 75% in the early 1960s to below 20% in 2024, demonstrating a profound and sustained erosion of confidence in a key institution that relies on expert guidance [4]. This general loss of faith is a symptom of several interconnected problems.

### Key Drivers of the Crisis

**1. High-Profile Failures of Experts**
Experts and the institutions they represent have made significant, high-impact errors that have undermined their credibility.
*   **Foreign Policy:** The 2003 invasion of Iraq was predicated on expert intelligence assessments about weapons of mass destruction that proved catastrophically wrong, leading to a costly war and a lasting sense of betrayal [9].
*   **Economics:** Economists failed to foresee the 2008 financial crisis and, more recently, struggled to understand and predict the post-pandemic inflationary surge, leading to public skepticism about their models and advice [5, 6].
*   **Public Health:** During the COVID-19 pandemic, institutions like the CDC suffered from what Frances Lee and Stephen Macedo describe as paralysis due to political polarization. Conflicting and changing guidance on matters like masks, school closures, and the origins of the virus damaged the public's perception of scientific and medical authorities as objective sources of truth [1].

**2. Institutional Decay and Politicization**
The organizations responsible for creating, vetting, and disseminating expert knowledge have themselves lost public trust due to perceived bias and internal dysfunction.
*   **The Media:** Legacy media outlets are increasingly seen as partisan actors rather than neutral arbiters of fact. A former senior editor at NPR described how the organization lost the trust of a wide swath of America by adopting a rigid, progressive worldview that alienated audiences outside of its urban, liberal base [13]. Similarly, critics have argued that outlets like *The New York Times* have prioritized a particular narrative over objective reporting, further eroding their authority [15].
*   **Academia and Science:** The "replication crisis," particularly in fields like psychology, has revealed that many published research findings may be false, undermining the very foundation of scientific knowledge [8]. This is compounded by high-profile cases of academic fraud, such as that of a star professor at Harvard Business School, which receive significant media attention and suggest that the systems for ensuring integrity are flawed [7, 12].

**3. The Revolt of the Public**
As articulated by Martin Gurri, the digital information explosion has shattered the information monopoly once held by legacy institutions [3]. The internet and social media have empowered ordinary citizens to access information, voice dissent, and organize against established authorities. This "Revolt of the Public" is not necessarily an anti-intellectual rejection of knowledge, but a rejection of the authority of institutions that are now seen as fallible, biased, or self-serving [2, 3]. This new media environment allows for the rapid rise of alternative sources of expertise, from independent journalists on Substack to podcasters, who fill the trust vacuum left by legacy institutions [11]. While this can democratize information, it also creates challenges in discerning credible information from misinformation [16].

**4. A Conflict of Class and Status**
The crisis of expertise is also a social and political phenomenon rooted in class identity. The term "expert" has become associated with a highly-educated, urban, professional class. The backlash against expertise is, in part, a populist revolt against a perceived condescending elite [2, 19]. Matthew Yglesias argues that the crisis is fundamentally *about experts* themselvesâ€”their insularity, their tendency toward groupthink, and their dismissive attitude toward public concerns. When experts frame disagreements as a matter of their enlightenment versus the public's ignorance, they fuel resentment and further erode trust [18]. This transforms factual disputes into status conflicts between the credentialed class and those who feel marginalized by them [19].

In summary, the crisis of expertise is a deeply rooted issue. It stems from the demonstrable failures of experts in critical areas, the decay and politicization of the institutions meant to uphold knowledge, the technological empowerment of a newly skeptical public, and the transformation of expertise into a marker of social class. Restoring trust would require not only better performance from experts but also a significant reform of the institutions they inhabit and a more humble and responsive relationship with the public they claim to serve [1, 18].
