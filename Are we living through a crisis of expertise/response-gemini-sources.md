Based on the provided sources, the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that we are living through a significant crisis of expertise, characterized by declining public trust, repeated failures by experts, and a newly empowered public that is increasingly skeptical of traditional authority. This crisis is not a simple rejection of knowledge, but a complex phenomenon driven by both the shortcomings of elite institutions and the public's enhanced ability to challenge them.

### The Collapse of Trust and the Revolt of the Public

The foundation of this crisis is a historical decline in public trust. Decades of data show a steep and steady erosion of faith in key institutions. Since the 1960s, public trust in the federal government has plummeted from over 75% to near-historic lows of 16% in 2024 (Pew Research, 2024). This collapse in trust is not limited to government. Martin Gurri, in *The Revolt of the Public*, argues that the digital revolution has fundamentally altered the information landscape, ending the monopoly that legacy institutions like government, media, and academia once held on public discourse. This has empowered the public to openly criticize and revolt against authority when it fails to meet expectations (Gurri, 2018). The result is a populist backlash fueled by a perception of elite failure, where the public's anger is directed at institutions they no longer see as competent or trustworthy (Conspicuous Cognition, 2024).

### High-Profile Failures Across Multiple Domains

The public's skepticism is not baseless but is rooted in a series of significant and visible failures by experts in various fields.

*   **Policy and Geopolitics:** The decision-making process leading to the Iraq War serves as a key example where expert consensus was catastrophically wrong, leading to disastrous consequences and teaching the "wrong lessons" about intervention and intelligence (The Last Psychiatrist, 2007). More recently, the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic exposed deep divisions among experts and led to policy and communication failures that squandered public trust, with many critical lessons still unlearned (Mounk, 2025).

*   **Economics:** The field of economics has suffered major blows to its credibility. Economists largely failed to predict the 2008 financial crisis and have struggled to explain recent inflationary trends, leading to admissions that they "don't know what's going on" (The Economist, 2025). This has undermined the authority of a discipline that once held immense sway in public policy (Not On Your Team, 2024).

*   **Science and Academia:** The integrity of the scientific process itself has come into question. There is growing concern over widespread issues like scientific fraud, data manipulation, and a "replication crisis" where foundational studies cannot be reproduced (Vox, 2024; PMC, 2024). This internal crisis is exemplified by high-profile cases, such as Harvard University taking the extremely rare step of revoking tenure from a star business professor for data fraud, which damages the credibility of the entire academic enterprise (WGBH, 2025).

*   **Media:** As the primary institutions for disseminating expert knowledge, the media's own loss of credibility has been a major contributor to the crisis. A former senior editor at NPR described how the organization lost the trust of a significant portion of the American public by developing an ideological echo chamber, which undermined its claim to be an objective arbiter of facts (The FP, 2024).

### The Rise of Alternative Authorities and Skepticism

The vacuum left by the declining authority of traditional experts is being filled by a new ecosystem of alternative information sources and a renewed validation of non-expert perspectives. The public is increasingly turning to alternative figures, such as "podcast bros," who challenge the mainstream consensus (ncofnas.com, 2024). This shift is bolstered by a defense of non-experts, which argues that when established authorities repeatedly fail, lay skepticism is not only understandable but also rational (Aporia Magazine, 2024). This dynamic points to a fundamental breakdown in the relationship between the public and the expert class, with clear warning signs of institutional decay becoming more apparent (The Honest Broker, 2024).

In conclusion, the sources collectively paint a clear picture of a crisis of expertise. It is a dual-sided crisis: experts and the institutions that house them have damaged their own credibility through significant failures, a lack of transparency, and internal misconduct. Simultaneously, a public empowered by new technology is no longer willing to offer deference, resulting in a widespread "revolt" against traditional authority and a search for answers elsewhere.
