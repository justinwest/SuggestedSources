# Are we living through a crisis of expertise?

Based on the provided sources, we are living through a profound crisis of expertise. This crisis is not one-sided; it is a dual phenomenon characterized by both a dramatic decline in public trust in experts and institutions, and a concurrent series of significant failures by those same experts and institutions [2, 3].

The erosion of public trust is a well-documented, long-term trend. For decades, public confidence in government and its associated institutions has been in steep decline. In 1958, 73% of Americans trusted the federal government to do what is right always or most of the time; by 2024, that figure had plummeted to just 16% [4]. This collapse in trust extends beyond government to a wide range of authoritative bodies, including the media and academia [13, 16].

Martin Gurri, in *The Revolt of the Public*, argues that this is not a temporary dip in confidence but a fundamental shift driven by the information age. The digital revolution has shattered the information monopoly once held by elite institutions, empowering the public to see their failures, hypocrisies, and internal disagreements in real-time. This has led to a "revolt" against established authority, as the public is no longer a passive recipient of information but an active, and often cynical, participant [3]. This sentiment is echoed by commentators who see the rise of populism as a direct "backlash" to a series of "elite failures" [2]. As a result, the public increasingly turns to alternative, non-credentialed sources of information, from "podcast bros" to other non-experts, who are perceived as more authentic or aligned with their views [10, 11].

However, this public revolt is not happening in a vacuum. It is fueled by a consistent record of high-profile expert failures that have damaged credibility across multiple domains:

*   **Policy and Geopolitics:** The consensus among intelligence and policy experts leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which was based on flawed intelligence about weapons of mass destruction, remains a foundational event in the erosion of trust in foreign policy elites [9].
*   **Economics:** Economists largely failed to predict the 2008 financial crisis and have since struggled to provide clear, consistent explanations for phenomena like the post-COVID inflation surge, leading to admissions that they often "don't know what's going on" [5, 6].
*   **Public Health:** The COVID-19 pandemic exposed deep institutional failures. The CDC and FDA, once seen as gold-standard authorities, were criticized for confusing guidance, slow responses, and becoming entangled in political polarization, which severely damaged their credibility [1].
*   **Academia and Science:** The bedrock of expertise—scientific research—has been shaken by internal crises. A significant portion of published research, particularly in fields like psychology, may be false due to methodological flaws and publication bias, a phenomenon known as the "replication crisis" [8]. This is compounded by high-profile cases of academic fraud, such as a tenured Harvard professor being fired for data manipulation, which undermine the integrity of the entire enterprise [7, 12].
*   **Media:** Institutions that once served as trusted gatekeepers are now often seen as partisan actors. Insider accounts from organizations like NPR and critical analyses of outlets like *The New York Times* describe a loss of institutional neutrality and a turn towards activism, alienating large segments of the public [13, 15].

In summary, the crisis of expertise is a feedback loop. Experts and their institutions have failed in critical moments, demonstrating fallibility and sometimes a lack of objectivity [1, 5, 9, 14]. The public, newly empowered by a decentralized information ecosystem, has responded with deep-seated skepticism and a "revolt" against traditional authority [3, 4]. This has created an environment where it is increasingly difficult to build the consensus needed to solve complex problems, as the very definition of who qualifies as an "expert" is now profoundly contested [16].
