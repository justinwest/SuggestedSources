Yes, the provided sources collectively argue that we are living through a significant crisis of expertise. This crisis is not a simple matter of the public being irrational, but is rooted in documented failures by experts and institutions, a changed information environment, and a breakdown of trust along social and class lines [2, 3, 19]. The crisis is characterized by two main phenomena: a steep decline in public trust and a series of high-profile failures by the expert class itself.

### The Decline in Public Trust
The most quantifiable evidence of this crisis is the collapse in public trust in major institutions. The Pew Research Center has tracked public trust in the federal government since 1958, and its data shows a stark decline. While trust levels were around 75% in the early 1960s, they have hovered below 20% for most of the 21st century [4]. This is not just a political phenomenon but extends to other key pillars of society, including the media and academia, leading to a general sense of unease where it is difficult to know who or what to believe [13, 16]. Martin Gurri, in his seminal work *The Revolt of the Public*, argues that the digital revolution has shattered the information monopoly once held by elite institutions. The public is no longer a passive recipient of information but an active participant, able to witness and share evidence of expert failures in real-time, leading to a permanent state of skepticism and revolt against established authorities [3].

### Causes Rooted in Expert and Institutional Failure
The decline in trust is not unfounded but is a direct response to significant, observable failures across various domains.

*   **Major Policy Disasters**: Catastrophic failures in public policy have severely damaged the credibility of the experts who promoted them. The 2003 invasion of Iraq, based on flawed intelligence and expert consensus, stands as a primary example of an elite-driven disaster that eroded public trust [9]. More recently, the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic saw inconsistent and often contradictory guidance from public health institutions, leading to widespread confusion and polarization, which Frances Lee and Stephen Macedo describe as a profound failure of those institutions [1].
*   **Failures in Specific Fields**: The crisis extends to specific fields of expertise. Economics, in particular, has faced criticism for failing to predict major events like the 2008 financial crisis and for its inability to effectively model recent inflation, leading some to conclude that economists are often just guessing [5, 6].
*   **Internal Flaws in the Knowledge-Creation Process**: The crisis is also internal to the systems that produce expert knowledge. The "replication crisis" in fields like psychology and medicine has revealed that many published research findings may be false [8]. Furthermore, high-profile cases of scientific fraud, such as the one that led Harvard to revoke the tenure of a star business professor for data manipulation, undermine the integrity of the entire academic enterprise [7, 12]. These are not isolated incidents but symptoms of systemic issues, such as "coordination problems" where individually rational actions by scientists (e.g., chasing publications) lead to collectively poor outcomes [17].
*   **Decay of Media Gatekeepers**: The institutions responsible for translating and disseminating expert knowledge to the public have also lost credibility. Former editors and journalists at legacy outlets like NPR and *The New York Times* have described how their organizations lost public trust by abandoning principles of objectivity in favor of a narrow, ideological worldview, thereby alienating large segments of the population [13, 15].

### The Social Dimension: Status and Class
Several sources argue that the crisis of expertise cannot be understood solely as a matter of competence, but must be seen as a conflict over status and class [2, 19]. Matthew Yglesias at *Slow Boring* posits that the public's frustration is often less about experts being wrong and more about them acting as a social class that uses its credentials to enforce social norms and signal its own virtue [18]. When experts wrap their pronouncements in the language of moral superiority, disagreement becomes not a factual dispute but an act of social rebellion [19]. This transforms policy debates into culture wars, where deferring to "The Experts" is seen as a marker of class identity, and rejecting them is a way for the public to push back against a perceived condescending elite [2, 18].

In this environment, non-experts and alternative figures, from "podcast bros" to independent writers, have gained influence by challenging the mainstream consensus [10, 11]. While this "revolt" can empower valuable dissent, it also creates vulnerabilities to misinformation and unvetted ideas [11].

In conclusion, the crisis of expertise is a complex phenomenon driven by a feedback loop of expert failures, a revolutionary shift in the information landscape that makes these failures more visible, and a deep-seated social conflict over status and authority. The result is a historically low level of public trust, not just in individual experts, but in the institutions that credential and support them [3, 4, 16].
