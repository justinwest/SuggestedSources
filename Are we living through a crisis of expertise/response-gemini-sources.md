Based on the provided sources, the consensus is that we are living through a significant crisis of expertise. This crisis is not simply about experts being wrong, but is a multi-faceted problem rooted in declining public trust, repeated and high-profile expert failures, and a transformed information environment that has fundamentally altered the relationship between the public and institutions of authority [3, 4, 19].

The crisis is characterized by several key factors:

### 1. Declining Public Trust and High-Profile Failures
Empirical data shows a stark decline in public confidence in major institutions. Trust in the U.S. government, for example, has fallen from over 75% in the early 1960s to near-historic lows of under 20% today, indicating a broad erosion of faith in the institutions that rely on and credential experts [4]. This decline is fueled by a series of significant and visible failures by experts across various domains:

*   **Public Health:** The COVID-19 pandemic exposed deep institutional failures. Public health bodies like the CDC were criticized for flawed communication, inconsistent guidance on masks and lockdowns, and an inability to adapt, which damaged their credibility [1].
*   **Economics:** Economists have been criticized for failing to predict major events like the 2008 financial crisis and the post-pandemic inflation surge, leading to a perception that their models are out of touch with reality [5, 6].
*   **Foreign Policy:** The intelligence and policy failures leading to the Iraq War, based on incorrect assumptions about weapons of mass destruction, remain a primary example of expert-led catastrophe that severely damaged public trust [9].
*   **Academia and Research:** The foundation of expertise—scientific and academic research—is itself in crisis. Problems include a "replication crisis" where many published findings cannot be reproduced, suggesting they may be false [8]. This is compounded by rising instances of outright research fraud, which has become a significant industry, and high-profile scandals, such as a tenured Harvard Business School professor being fired for data manipulation, further undermining the credibility of academic institutions [7, 12, 22].

### 2. The Information Revolution and the "Revolt of the Public"
The digital revolution has fundamentally changed the information landscape. Martin Gurri argues in *The Revolt of the Public* that the internet and social media have shattered the information monopoly once held by legacy institutions like governments, academia, and major news outlets [3]. This has empowered the public to access alternative information, openly criticize official narratives, and form networks outside of traditional authority. This new dynamic means that expert pronouncements are no longer received by a passive audience but are actively contested in a chaotic digital public square [3, 11].

This is exacerbated by the declining trustworthiness of the media gatekeepers themselves. Former insiders and critics argue that institutions like NPR and *The New York Times* have lost credibility due to perceived ideological bias and internal turmoil, pushing audiences to seek information elsewhere [13, 15].

### 3. Expertise as a Matter of Status and Class
Several analyses argue the crisis is not just about competence but has become entangled with status, class, and politics [2, 19]. In this view, "expertise" is now perceived by many not as a source of objective knowledge, but as a tool used by a high-status, highly educated class to enforce its own social and political preferences. When experts opine on contentious issues like COVID-19 policies or climate change, their recommendations are often seen as expressions of their social standing rather than neutral, factual advice [19, 20].

This perception fuels a populist backlash, where distrust of experts becomes a way of resisting a perceived ruling class [2]. This transforms disagreements over facts into much deeper conflicts over status and identity, making them harder to resolve [20].

### 4. Systemic and Institutional Dysfunction
The crisis also stems from the inherent difficulty of managing modern, complex systems. Even with good intentions, experts and institutions can fail due to coordination problems, where individually rational actions lead to collectively poor outcomes [18]. As our systems (in technology, finance, and governance) become more complex, they become more fragile and susceptible to a "competence crisis," where the skills required to manage them are increasingly scarce or misaligned with institutional incentives [21]. This suggests that the failures are not just the fault of individuals, but are baked into the structure of our institutions [1].

In conclusion, the evidence points to a deep and multifaceted crisis of expertise. It is driven by a feedback loop of real expert failures, plummeting public trust, a revolutionary shift in the information environment empowering public skepticism, and the entanglement of expertise with social status and political polarization [3, 4, 19].
