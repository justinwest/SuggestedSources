# Are we living through a crisis of expertise?

Based on the provided sources, we are living through a significant crisis of expertise, characterized by declining public trust, repeated and high-profile failures by experts, and internal decay within the institutions that produce and disseminate expert knowledge [2, 3]. This is not merely a matter of public ignorance but is rooted in tangible failures that have damaged the credibility of experts across multiple domains [1, 5, 9].

### The Collapse of Trust and the Revolt of the Public
A foundational element of this crisis is the dramatic decline in public trust in key institutions. For decades, trust in the U.S. government, a major employer and consumer of expert advice, has been in a state of near-continuous decline, with only about 16% of the public expressing trust in 2024 [4]. This erosion of trust is part of a broader phenomenon Martin Gurri terms the "Revolt of the Public," where the digital information age has empowered ordinary people to challenge the authority and pronouncements of traditional elites and experts [3]. This populist backlash is not baseless but is often a direct response to a series of "elite failures" that have left the public disillusioned with the competence of its leadership [2].

### A Pattern of Failure Across Expert Domains
The crisis is fueled by visible failures in fields that rely heavily on expert guidance:

*   **Public Health:** The COVID-19 pandemic exposed deep flaws in the response from public health institutions. The handling of the pandemic led to widespread confusion and a significant loss of public trust, with experts and policymakers failing to learn the correct lessons from the experience [1, 8].
*   **Economics:** The economics profession is facing its own credibility crisis after failing to foresee major events like the post-pandemic inflation surge. This has led to the conclusion that "economists don’t know what’s going on," undermining their status as reliable guides for policy [5, 6].
*   **Foreign Policy:** Foundational events like the Iraq War are cited as catastrophic failures of the expert class, based on flawed intelligence and analysis, which severely damaged the credibility of foreign policy and intelligence establishments [9].

### Institutional Decay and Internal Corruption
The authority of experts is also being undermined from within by corruption, ideological capture, and a lack of accountability.

*   **Science and Academia:** The integrity of scientific research is threatened by widespread fraud. Cases of data manipulation often go unpunished, and when they are exposed—as with a prominent Harvard Business School professor who was stripped of tenure for data fraud—they damage the reputation of the entire academic enterprise [7, 12].
*   **Legacy Media:** The institutions tasked with mediating expert knowledge for the public, such as *The New York Times* and NPR, are seen as having lost their way and the public's trust [13, 15]. Critics, including former insiders, argue these organizations have succumbed to ideological capture, abandoning objectivity and alienating large segments of their audience [13]. This broader institutional decay is marked by warning signs such as a loss of mission and a focus on internal narratives over external reality [14].

### The Rise of Alternative Authorities
The vacuum created by the failure of traditional experts is being filled by alternative sources of information and analysis. This has led to the rise of non-expert commentators, such as "podcast bros," who command large audiences by challenging the mainstream consensus [11]. While sometimes criticized, there is also an argument to be made "in defence of non-experts," who can offer valuable outsider perspectives free from the groupthink that can afflict credentialed communities [10]. This shift signals a fundamental breakdown in the traditional hierarchy of knowledge, as a skeptical public increasingly looks elsewhere for guidance [3].
