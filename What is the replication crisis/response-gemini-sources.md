The replication crisis, also known as the reproducibility crisis, is an ongoing methodological crisis primarily affecting the social and medical sciences [1, 6]. It refers to the finding that the results of many published scientific studies are difficult or impossible to reproduce when other researchers attempt to replicate the original experiment. This failure to replicate key findings has cast doubt on the reliability of a significant body of scientific literature and has prompted calls for widespread reform of scientific practices [4].

The crisis gained widespread attention following a landmark 2015 study published in *Science*. In this project, a large team of researchers attempted to replicate 100 prominent experimental and correlational studies from top psychology journals. They found that while 97% of the original studies had reported statistically significant results, only 36% of the replication attempts did [1]. This discrepancy highlighted a systemic problem. Subsequent analyses and models suggest a high rate of false or exaggerated claims; one model, for example, estimated that approximately 75% of psychology claims may be false [2]. While this specific number is a high-end estimate, other analyses confirm that factors like publication bias and low statistical power have historically created an environment where many published findings are likely to be false discoveries [7].

The problem is not confined to psychology. The medical field faces a similar crisis, with numerous clinical trials being deemed untrustworthy due to flawed or fabricated data [6]. This issue is particularly severe in areas like Alzheimer's research, where allegations of data fraud in foundational studies have potentially misdirected billions of dollars in funding and decades of research, delaying the search for a cure [3].

**Key Causes of the Replication Crisis:**

*   **Publication Bias:** Journals have historically shown a strong preference for publishing novel, positive, and "clean" results. Studies that find no effect (null results) or that replicate a previous finding are much harder to publish. This creates a distorted view of the evidence, known as the "file drawer problem," where failed experiments are hidden away [7].
*   **Questionable Research Practices (QRPs):** In the pressure to "publish or perish," researchers may engage in practices that inflate the chances of getting a statistically significant result. This includes *p-hacking*, which involves trying many different statistical analyses and only reporting the one that produces a "significant" p-value (p < .05), or selectively choosing which data to include [4, 7].
*   **Low Statistical Power:** Many studies, particularly older ones, were conducted with small sample sizes. A study with low statistical power is less likely to detect a true effect if one exists and is more likely to produce a false positive (finding an effect that isn't really there) [7].
*   **Outright Fraud:** While considered less common than QRPs, deliberate fabrication or falsification of data is a significant contributor. Such fraud can have devastating consequences, leading to the pursuit of useless treatments, wasting immense resources, and causing direct harm to patients who participate in or are treated based on fraudulent trials [3, 5, 6].

**Prominent Examples:**

The crisis is well-illustrated by the re-examination of famous theories.
*   **Ego Depletion:** The highly influential theory that willpower is a limited resource that can be "drained" has largely failed to replicate in large, pre-registered, multi-lab studies, leading to what some researchers have called its "collapse" as a viable theory.
*   **Stereotype Threat:** This is the idea that being aware of a negative stereotype about one's group (e.g., regarding academic performance) can impair performance. While a foundational concept in social psychology, its effects have appeared much weaker and less reliable in recent meta-analyses and replication attempts, prompting a "reckoning" within the field [4].

The consequences of the replication crisis are severe. It erodes public trust in science, wastes taxpayer money on flawed research, and, in the medical field, can lead to dangerous treatments and a staggering death toll from scientific lies [3, 5]. However, the crisis has also sparked a major reform movement within science focused on transparency and rigor, including practices like pre-registering study hypotheses and methods, sharing data openly, and placing a higher value on direct replication studies.

    This foundational 2015 paper by the Open Science Collaboration provides the primary empirical evidence for the replication crisis. The authors attempted to replicate 100 psychology studies and found that the rate of significant findings in the replications (around 36%) was far lower than in the original studies (97%), demonstrating a systemic problem with reproducibility in the field.

    This article argues for a high rate of false claims in psychology. The author synthesizes findings from replication projects and applies a statistical model to estimate that the "false discovery rate" in psychology could be as high as 75%, painting a stark picture of the crisis's scale.

    This opinion piece illustrates the real-world consequences of the crisis beyond social science. The author argues that major fraud allegations in Alzheimer's research have derailed the field for years, wasting billions of dollars and giving false hope, thereby highlighting how scientific misconduct can impede progress on critical health issues.

    Written by a prominent researcher in the field, this essay provides an insider's view of the crisis through the lens of a specific theory, stereotype threat. Inzlicht describes how replication failures and new meta-analyses have weakened the evidence for this once-celebrated concept, forcing the field to confront its methods and past certainties.

    This report demonstrates that the replication crisis is a major problem in medicine. The author details the work of researchers who uncover faked or fatally flawed data in clinical trials ("zombie trials"), showing that a significant portion of the medical literature may be unreliable and potentially harmful.

    This research article provides a quantitative historical analysis of the causes of the replication crisis in psychology. The authors find that while statistical power in studies has slowly increased over time, strong publication bias in favor of positive results has persisted, creating conditions where a high rate of false findings is expected.
