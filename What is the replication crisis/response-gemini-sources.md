The replication crisis, also known as the reproducibility crisis, is an ongoing methodological crisis primarily affecting the social and medical sciences [1, 2]. It refers to the finding that many influential scientific studies are difficult or impossible to replicate—meaning that when other independent researchers repeat the study using the same methods, they do not get the same results [4]. This has raised significant concerns about the credibility of a substantial portion of the published scientific literature [3, 4].

The crisis gained widespread attention following several key events and publications. A foundational 2005 paper by John Ioannidis, titled "Why Most Published Research Findings Are False," used statistical modeling to argue that factors like small study sizes, publication bias, and a focus on novel findings make it likely that most published claims are incorrect [3]. The issue was further solidified by large-scale replication projects. A landmark 2015 study by the Open Science Collaboration attempted to replicate 100 studies published in top psychology journals and found that only 36% of the replications produced statistically significant results, compared to 97% of the original studies [2]. Similarly, a 2016 survey published in *Nature* found that over 70% of researchers had tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half had failed to reproduce their own [1].

Several interconnected factors are believed to cause the replication crisis:

*   **Publication Bias:** Journals and funding agencies have historically shown a strong preference for publishing positive, novel, and statistically significant results. Studies that find no effect (null results) or that simply replicate previous work are often rejected, creating a skewed and overly optimistic body of literature known as the "file drawer problem" [1, 4].
*   **Questionable Research Practices (QRPs):** To achieve statistically significant results required for publication, some researchers engage in practices like "p-hacking" (analyzing data in multiple ways until a p-value below the .05 threshold is found) or "HARKing" (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) [5, 6]. These practices increase the rate of false positives but are often done without fraudulent intent, stemming instead from pressure and a misunderstanding of statistics [6].
*   **Low Statistical Power:** Many studies, particularly in fields like psychology and neuroscience, are "underpowered," meaning they use sample sizes that are too small to reliably detect a true effect. Underpowered studies are more likely to produce false negatives (missing a real effect) and inflate the magnitude of false positives (finding an effect that isn't there) [3].
*   **Pressure to "Publish or Perish":** The academic career structure heavily incentivizes the quantity of publications in high-impact journals over the quality and rigor of the research. This pressure encourages researchers to prioritize speed and splashy findings over careful, methodical, and replicable science [1, 4].
*   **Lack of Transparency:** Historically, researchers were not required to share their raw data, analysis code, or detailed experimental materials, making it difficult for others to assess the work or attempt a direct replication [1, 6].

The consequences of this crisis are significant. It erodes public trust in science, wastes billions of dollars in funding on research that builds upon flawed or false premises, and slows down scientific progress [3, 4]. In medicine, it can lead to chasing ineffective clinical treatments based on non-replicable preclinical results [3].

In response, a powerful reform movement centered on "Open Science" has emerged to improve the credibility and transparency of research. Key solutions being implemented include:

*   **Preregistration and Registered Reports:** Researchers publicly declare their hypotheses, methods, and analysis plan *before* conducting the study. In the "Registered Report" format, journals grant in-principle acceptance based on the methodological rigor of the preregistered plan, regardless of the final results. This eliminates publication bias against null findings and prevents p-hacking and HARKing [5, 6].
*   **Open Data and Materials:** A growing number of researchers, funders, and journals are mandating that authors make their data, code, and materials publicly available, allowing for full transparency and reproducibility [1, 6].
*   **Promoting Replication:** There is a greater emphasis on the value of conducting and publishing high-quality replication studies to either validate or correct the scientific record [1].

Ultimately, the replication crisis is seen by many scientists not as a sign that science is broken, but as a necessary and healthy period of self-correction that is leading to more robust, transparent, and reliable scientific practices [6].

    This article reports on a large-scale survey conducted by *Nature* on the reproducibility crisis. The author summarizes the views of 1,576 researchers, revealing that a majority believe there is a significant crisis. The article highlights that most scientists have experienced failures in reproducing experiments and points to pressure to publish and selective reporting as primary causes.

    This is the report from a major collaborative effort to systematically replicate 100 psychological studies. The authors found that the success rate of replication was far lower than expected, providing strong empirical evidence for the replication crisis and highlighting that the effect sizes of replicated studies were, on average, half the magnitude of the original reports.

    In this highly influential theoretical paper, Ioannidis argues from a statistical perspective that structural problems in how science is conducted—including low statistical power, the pursuit of novel findings, and researcher bias—logically lead to a situation where the majority of published findings in many fields are false positives.

    This article provides a journalistic overview of the problem, arguing that the incentive structure in modern science ("publish or perish") is a root cause of the crisis. It suggests that competition for funds and jobs encourages sloppy work and that a lack of replication studies allows flawed research to persist, ultimately damaging the scientific enterprise and public trust.

    The authors propose a specific, practical solution to the replication crisis: Registered Reports. They argue that this publication format, where studies are accepted based on the rigor of their methods *before* data is collected, removes the incentive for questionable research practices like p-hacking and HARKing, thereby increasing the credibility of the results.

    Spellman frames the replication crisis as a positive and necessary "course correction" for science. She argues that systemic issues, rather than just individual fraud, are the main problem. The author expresses optimism that reforms like open data and preregistration are creating a more transparent and credible scientific process.
