Based on the provided sources, the replication crisis is a methodological and confidence crisis within the sciences, where a significant number of published research findings have been found to be difficult or impossible to replicate in subsequent studies [7]. This has led to a re-evaluation of the reliability of scientific claims, particularly in fields like social psychology [4, 7].

Key aspects of the replication crisis include:

*   **Widespread Replication Failures**: A foundational event in the crisis was a 2015 large-scale study published in *Science* that attempted to replicate 100 studies from three prominent psychology journals. It found that while 97% of the original studies had statistically significant results, only 36% of the replications did [1]. Furthermore, the average effect size of the replicated studies was about half that of the original findings [1]. This empirical data demonstrated a systematic discrepancy between original and replicated research. Some interpretations of these failures suggest that a high percentage of claims in psychology, possibly around 75%, may be false [2].

*   **A "Reckoning" Within Scientific Fields**: The inability to replicate key findings has forced a "reckoning" in disciplines like social psychology [4]. Long-standing and influential theories, such as "stereotype threat," have come under scrutiny after facing significant replication challenges, leading researchers to question once-established knowledge [4]. This reflects an internal crisis of confidence and a re-examination of core methodologies and theories [4, 7].

*   **Systemic Causes Beyond Honest Error**: The crisis is not solely due to random error. It is also fueled by systemic issues in scientific practice, including publication bias (the tendency to only publish novel, positive results) and questionable research practices [7]. In its most severe form, the issue extends to deliberate scientific fraud, such as the fabrication of data and manipulation of images in fields like Alzheimer's research [3, 5].

*   **Severe Real-World Consequences**: The replication crisis is not merely an academic debate. When findings, particularly in medical science, are based on unreliable or fraudulent data, the consequences can be devastating. This includes derailing entire fields of research for years, wasting billions of dollars in funding, and causing patient harm or death by pursuing ineffective treatments or delaying valid ones [3, 5]. The crisis therefore highlights that scientific lies and unreliable research can have a staggering death toll [5].

In summary, the replication crisis is a crisis of credibility in science, sparked by widespread failures to reproduce published findings. It points to systemic problems in how science is conducted and published, has forced fields to re-evaluate core theories, and has been linked to severe real-world harm when it involves deliberate fraud [1, 3, 4, 7].

1.  **Estimating the Reproducibility of Psychological Science – ''Science''** (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26315443/)
    *   This 2015 peer-reviewed study provides the foundational empirical evidence for the replication crisis. The authors from the Open Science Collaboration systematically attempted to replicate 100 psychology studies, finding that a large majority could not be reproduced successfully, providing quantitative data on the scale of the problem.

2.  **~75 % of Psychology Claims Are False – ''Unsafe Science'' (Substack)** (https://unsafescience.substack.com/p/75-of-psychology-claims-are-false)
    *   This opinion and analysis piece interprets the findings of replication studies to argue for a high rate of false claims within psychology. The author frames the replication failures as evidence that the field's published literature is largely unreliable.

3.  **The Long Shadow of Fraud in Alzheimer’s Research – ''The New York Times''** (https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/opinion/alzheimers-fraud-cure.html)
    *   This op-ed argues that the replication crisis extends to outright fraud, using Alzheimer's research as a key example. The author's view is that deliberate misconduct can mislead entire scientific fields for decades, with catastrophic consequences for medical progress and public trust.

4.  **Revisiting Stereotype Threat: A Reckoning for Social Psychology – Michael Inzlicht** (https://www.factfaq.com/resources/Revisiting_Stereotype_Threat_-_by_Michael_Inzlicht.pdf)
    *   This scholarly essay by a social psychologist presents an insider's view of the crisis. Inzlicht uses the prominent theory of "stereotype threat" as a case study to describe the "reckoning" within his field, as once-celebrated findings face replication challenges, forcing a painful re-evaluation of established knowledge.

5.  **The Staggering Death Toll of Scientific Lies – ''Vox''** (https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/368350/scientific-research-fraud-crime-jail-time)
    *   This explanatory article focuses on the most severe real-world impacts of the problems underlying the replication crisis. The author argues that scientific fraud is not a victimless crime and can lead to patient deaths and immense societal harm, connecting the abstract crisis to life-and-death consequences.

6.  **What the reproducibility crisis is — and isn’t - *Nature*** (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02299-w)
    *   This article provides a nuanced definition of the replication crisis. It likely clarifies the distinctions between reproducibility, replicability, and fraud, arguing what the crisis represents and what it does not, aiming to frame the problem accurately for a broad scientific audience.

7.  **The replication crisis and the credibility of psychological science - *Perspectives on Psychological Science*** (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10581498/)
    *   This peer-reviewed article offers a formal academic perspective on the crisis. The author defines it as a crisis of confidence stemming from replication failures and explores the systemic causes, such as publication bias and questionable research practices, that have undermined the credibility of psychological science.
