# What is the replication crisis?

The replication crisis (often called the reproducibility crisis) refers to the growing recognition that a substantial proportion of published scientific findings cannot be duplicated when independent researchers repeat the study using the same or highly similar methods. The crisis is most visible in psychology and biomedicine, but it affects many other fields, including economics, social sciences, ecology, and parts of the physical and computer sciences.

1. Origins and Early Warning Signs
• 1960s–1990s: Isolated critiques of statistical practice and selective reporting appeared, but concerns were largely dismissed as anecdotal.  
• 2005: John Ioannidis’ paper “Why Most Published Research Findings Are False” mathematically argued that, given common research practices, many reported effects are likely spurious.  
• 2011–2015: High-profile failures to replicate “priming” effects in social psychology, and large multicenter projects such as the Reproducibility Project: Psychology (which reproduced only 39% of 100 landmark studies), moved the issue from rumor to crisis.

2. Scope Across Disciplines
• Psychology: Classic results on social priming, ego depletion, and stereotype threat have shown weak or inconsistent replication.  
• Biomedicine: Pharmaceutical companies (e.g., Amgen, Bayer) reported that only 11–25% of preclinical cancer biology papers replicated sufficiently for drug development.  
• Economics: The “Many Labs” and “Social Science Replication Project” found 60–70% replication success rates, falling below earlier expectations.  
• Genomics & Neuroscience: Early candidate-gene studies and small-sample fMRI experiments have produced many non-replicable results.  
• Machine Learning & AI: Claims of state-of-the-art performance sometimes fail under reproducibility audits due to unavailable code, data leakage, or hyper-parameter sensitivity.

3. Contributing Factors
Methodological
  – Underpowered studies (small sample sizes, low signal-to-noise ratios).  
  – Flexible analytic pipelines: multiple outcome measures, variable exclusion criteria, and optional stopping (“p-hacking” or “garden of forking paths”).  
  – Misinterpretation of p-values, overreliance on a 0.05 threshold, and publication based on statistical significance rather than effect size or predictive accuracy.  

Systemic Incentives
  – Publication bias (“file-drawer problem”): Journals prefer positive, novel results, discouraging null findings.  
  – Career pressures: Funding, promotion, and prestige reward quantity of publications and novelty over robustness.  
  – Lack of transparency: Restricted data/code impede independent verification.

Cultural & Cognitive
  – HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known).  
  – Confirmation bias and motivated reasoning.  
  – “Discovery” narrative valued over incremental progress.

4. Consequences
• Erosion of public trust in science when celebrated findings fail to hold up.  
• Wasted resources pursuing false leads, especially costly in drug development or policy interventions.  
• Meta-analyses and theoretical frameworks built on unstable foundations.  
• Chilling effect on early-career researchers who fear retribution for challenging established results.

5. Responses and Reforms
Open Science Practices
  – Preregistration: Publicly time-stamped study protocols and analysis plans reduce researcher degrees of freedom.  
  – Registered Reports: Journals commit to publish based on methodological rigor before results are known.  
  – Data and code sharing, FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, and platforms like OSF, Zenodo, GitHub.

Statistical & Methodological Improvements
  – Larger, multi-lab collaborations to boost power and generalizability.  
  – Use of Bayesian statistics, multiverse analyses, and specification-curve analyses.  
  – Lowering the default alpha (e.g., 0.005) or emphasizing effect sizes and confidence intervals over dichotomous significance.

Incentive Realignment
  – Funders and institutions awarding replication grants and valuing reproducibility metrics.  
  – Badges and credit systems for open data, open materials, and preregistration.  
  – Journals establishing reproducibility checklists, supplementary repositories, and statistical review boards.

Training & Culture
  – Integrating reproducible workflows into graduate curricula (e.g., version control, literate programming).  
  – Recognizing and celebrating replication as a legitimate scientific contribution.

6. Ongoing Debates
• Severity of the problem: Some argue that 40–60% replication rates are acceptable given complexity, while others view them as a crisis.  
• Field heterogeneity: Laboratory‐based cognitive tasks may replicate differently from field studies or qualitative work.  
• Cost-benefit balance: Over-standardization might stifle innovation; absolute reproducibility is unattainable in some contexts (e.g., ethnography).  
• Statistical thresholds: Raising alpha reduces false positives but increases false negatives; trade-offs remain contentious.

7. Future Outlook
The replication crisis has catalyzed a methodological renaissance. Transparency reforms are spreading, and technological tools (preprint servers, version-controlled notebooks, automatic reproducibility checks) are becoming standard. While perfect reproducibility is impossible, making replication mundane rather than sensational is increasingly seen as critical to cumulative, self-correcting science.

In summary, the replication crisis is not a single scandal but a systemic challenge: a mismatch between traditional research practices and the statistical realities of modern science. Addressing it requires coordinated cultural, methodological, and incentive changes aimed at ensuring that scientific claims are durable, generalizable, and trustworthy.
