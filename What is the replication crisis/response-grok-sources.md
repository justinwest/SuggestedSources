The replication crisis refers to a widespread methodological and systemic issue in scientific research, particularly in fields like psychology, medicine, and social sciences, where a significant proportion of published findings cannot be reliably reproduced or replicated by independent researchers [1][2][7]. This crisis highlights problems with the reliability, validity, and trustworthiness of scientific claims, often stemming from factors such as poor study design, statistical misuse, publication biases, and in some cases, outright fraud [3][5][6]. It gained prominence in the early 2010s but has roots in earlier critiques, and it has prompted calls for reforms like preregistration of studies, open data sharing, and increased emphasis on replication efforts [1][4][8].

### Origins and Key Evidence
The term "replication crisis" emerged prominently following large-scale efforts to test the reproducibility of established findings. A landmark study in 2015 by the Open Science Collaboration attempted to replicate 100 experiments from high-profile psychology journals and found that only 39% produced statistically significant results consistent with the originals, with effect sizes often much smaller [1]. This suggested that many "statistically significant" findings might be false positives or exaggerated due to issues like low statistical power (i.e., small sample sizes that fail to detect true effects reliably) and selective reporting [7]. Extending this, analyses have estimated that up to 75% of claims in psychology could be false, driven by publication biases where journals favor novel, positive results over null or negative ones [2][7]. For instance, a 2023 study reviewing trends in psychology from 1975 to 2017 found persistent low statistical power (around 33% on average) and high false discovery rates, meaning many published "discoveries" are likely untrue [7].

The crisis is not limited to psychology. In medicine, similar issues plague clinical trials, with estimates suggesting that 18% or more of studies may be faked or fatally flawed due to data fabrication, plagiarism, or inadequate oversight [6]. High-profile cases of fraud, such as manipulated images in Alzheimer's research papers that influenced billions in funding and drug development, illustrate how non-replicable or fraudulent findings can persist and mislead entire fields for years [3][5]. Vox has highlighted the "staggering death toll" from such scientific lies, noting instances where flawed research led to harmful medical practices, like unnecessary surgeries or ineffective treatments, potentially contributing to thousands of deaths [5].

### Contributing Factors
Several interconnected factors fuel the crisis:
- **Publication Bias and "P-Hacking"**: Researchers may manipulate data analysis (e.g., selectively reporting results) to achieve p-values below 0.05, the common threshold for significance, leading to inflated false positives [2][7]. Journals' preference for exciting, positive results exacerbates this, as negative replications are harder to publish [1].
- **Low Replicability of Specific Effects**: Iconic concepts in psychology, such as "stereotype threat" (the idea that awareness of stereotypes impairs performance) and "ego depletion" (the notion that willpower is a finite resource), have failed large-scale replications, prompting researchers to question their validity [4][8]. For example, revisiting stereotype threat revealed that early studies overstated effects due to small samples and biases, with modern replications showing null results [4].
- **Fraud and Misconduct**: While not the sole cause, outright fabrication occurs, as seen in Alzheimer's research scandals where falsified data delayed progress and wasted resources [3]. In medicine, a 2023 Nature investigation found that unreliable trials undermine evidence-based practice, with some fields like anesthesiology having retraction rates far above average [6].
- **Broader Systemic Issues**: Incentives in academia reward quantity over quality, encouraging "questionable research practices" [2]. A foundational 2005 paper by epidemiologist John Ioannidis argued that most published research findings are false due to these biases, a prediction borne out by later replication projects [9].

### Impacts and Responses
The crisis erodes public trust in science and has real-world consequences, such as misguided policies, wasted funding (e.g., over $28 billion annually in the U.S. on irreproducible biomedical research [10]), and harm to patients [5][6]. In psychology, it has led to a "reckoning," with fields like social psychology undergoing self-correction through meta-analyses and replication initiatives [4][8]. Responses include the adoption of open science practices, such as the Center for Open Science's guidelines for transparency [1], and calls for journals to prioritize replications [2]. However, challenges persist, as fraud detection remains inconsistent, and some fields lag in reforms [3][6].

While the crisis is most discussed in "soft" sciences, it affects all empirical fields to varying degrees, underscoring the need for rigorous, transparent methods to ensure scientific progress [7][9].
