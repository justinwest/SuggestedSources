# What are deaths of despair?

Based on the sources provided, deaths of despair are fatalities resulting from suicide, drug and alcohol poisoning, and alcoholic liver disease [1, 2]. The term was created by economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton to describe a public health crisis driven by a "progressive loss of a way of life" for certain populations [2].

The key aspects of deaths of despair are:

*   **Specific Causes:** The term encompasses three specific causes of death: drug overdoses (poisonings), suicides, and chronic liver diseases related to alcohol abuse [1, 2].
*   **Underlying Drivers:** These deaths are not seen as isolated incidents but as symptoms of deeper, long-term social and economic problems [1]. The primary drivers include a "cumulative disadvantage" built up over time, stemming from:
    *   The decline in stable, well-paying jobs for individuals without a four-year college degree [2].
    *   The weakening of social institutions and community support structures, such as marriage and organized religion, which historically provided meaning and stability [2].
    *   Increased social isolation, economic precarity, and distress [1, 2].
*   **Affected Populations:** Case and Deaton first identified this trend among middle-aged white Americans without a college degree, a group whose mortality rates were rising while they were falling for most other demographics in wealthy countries [1, 2]. More recent data shows that this crisis is expanding and is now also a major cause of death for other groups, including Black men [1].
*   **Impact of COVID-19:** The conditions leading to deaths of despair were significantly worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, which introduced widespread grief, social isolation, and economic disruption, further fueling the crisis [1].

In essence, "deaths of despair" refers to a rise in self-destructive deaths linked to the loss of economic opportunity, community, and sense of purpose among working-class Americans [1, 2].

1.  The author frames "deaths of despair" as a slow-motion social and economic crisis, initially identified in white Americans without college degrees but now expanding to other groups. The article emphasizes how the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the underlying factors of isolation, economic disruption, and distress that contribute to these deaths.

2.  The authors present "deaths of despair" as a public health crisis resulting from the long-term, cumulative decline in the economic and social well-being of working-class Americans without a four-year college degree. They argue that this "progressive loss of a way of life" leads to increased pain, distress, and social isolation, which in turn drives the rising mortality from suicide, drug overdoses, and alcohol-related diseases.
