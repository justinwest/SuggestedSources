# What are deaths of despair?

Answer  
“Deaths of despair” is the umbrella term economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton gave to a specific set of premature deaths that share a common root in prolonged psychological distress and hopelessness.  The term refers to:  

1.  Suicides (intentional self-harm).  
2.  Fatal drug poisonings/overdoses, especially from opioids and other narcotics.  
3.  Alcohol-related liver diseases such as alcoholic cirrhosis.  

These deaths tend to cluster where economic insecurity, social isolation, chronic pain, and untreated mental-health problems leave people feeling that life has little future promise.  The same forces that erode hope—job loss, stagnant wages, collapsing community institutions, inadequate health care, and, more recently, the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic—fuel the behaviors that lead to the three lethal outcomes listed above [1] [2].
