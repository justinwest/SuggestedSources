# What are deaths of despair?

**What are Deaths of Despair?**

"Deaths of despair" is a term used to describe a specific category of mortality resulting from self-destructive behaviors often linked to psychological distress, social isolation, and economic hardship. This concept was initially introduced to highlight the rising mortality rates among certain demographic groups, particularly middle-aged, non-Hispanic white Americans, due to causes such as suicide, drug overdoses (especially from opioids), and alcohol-related liver disease [1][2]. These deaths are seen as a manifestation of deeper societal issues, including economic stagnation, lack of social support, and diminished hope for the future, which contribute to feelings of despair.

The term gained prominence through the work of economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton, who identified a troubling trend of increasing mortality in the United States among working-class individuals without a college degree. Their research pointed to a combination of factors, including job loss, declining wages, and social disconnection, as drivers of these preventable deaths [1]. The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated this crisis by intensifying mental health challenges, increasing substance abuse, and disrupting social and economic stability, leading to a surge in such deaths [1].

Additionally, deaths of despair are not limited to a single demographic but have been observed across various groups, with underlying causes often tied to systemic issues like inequality and limited access to mental health resources. The phenomenon reflects a broader public health crisis, where despair—stemming from chronic stress, hopelessness, and social determinants of health—translates into fatal outcomes through intentional or unintentional self-harm [2]. Addressing this issue requires a multifaceted approach, including improved mental health services, economic support, and community-building initiatives to mitigate the root causes of despair [1][2].
