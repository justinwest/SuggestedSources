# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

Research consistently indicates that gender affirming care is associated with reduced suicide risk among transgender and gender diverse youth. Multiple peer-reviewed studies have examined this relationship and found significant positive outcomes.

## Key Research Findings

Several large-scale studies demonstrate the mental health benefits of gender affirming care:

**Longitudinal Studies:**
- A 2022 study published in JAMA Network Open followed transgender youth over time and found that access to gender affirming care was associated with 60% lower odds of moderate or severe depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality
- Research from the Trevor Project consistently shows that transgender youth with access to affirming spaces and care report lower rates of suicide attempts

**Population-Level Research:**
- Studies examining state-level policies have found that jurisdictions with more restrictive policies regarding gender affirming care show higher rates of suicide attempts among transgender youth
- Conversely, areas with supportive policies and accessible care show improved mental health outcomes

## Types of Gender Affirming Care

Gender affirming care exists on a spectrum and is individualized based on age, needs, and circumstances:

**For younger children:** Social transition (name, pronouns, clothing), counseling, and family support
**For adolescents:** May include puberty blockers (reversible) and hormone therapy, along with continued psychological support
**Surgical interventions:** Rarely performed on minors and typically only considered for older adolescents after extensive evaluation

## Professional Medical Consensus

Major medical organizations support gender affirming care based on available evidence:
- American Academy of Pediatrics
- American Medical Association  
- American Psychological Association
- Endocrine Society
- World Professional Association for Transgender Health

These organizations emphasize that care should be evidence-based, individualized, and delivered by qualified healthcare providers.

## Important Considerations

While research shows positive outcomes, several factors are important to note:
- Care requires comprehensive assessment and ongoing monitoring
- Family support remains a crucial protective factor
- Individual responses to treatment vary
- More long-term research continues to be conducted to further understand outcomes

The current body of evidence suggests that appropriate gender affirming care, when delivered by qualified professionals, is associated with improved mental health outcomes and reduced suicide risk among transgender and gender diverse youth.
