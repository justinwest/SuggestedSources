# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

Research consistently indicates that access to gender-affirming care is associated with reduced suicide risk among transgender and gender-diverse youth. Multiple peer-reviewed studies have found significant mental health benefits when young people receive appropriate support and medical care.

## Key Research Findings

**Reduced Suicidal Ideation and Attempts:**
- Studies show that transgender youth with access to gender-affirming care, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy, experience substantially lower rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors
- A 2022 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that access to gender-affirming care was associated with 60% lower odds of moderate or severe depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality

**Impact of Family and Social Support:**
- Research demonstrates that family acceptance and social support are among the strongest protective factors
- The Family Acceptance Project found that transgender youth from highly accepting families had significantly lower suicide attempt rates compared to those from rejecting families

**Medical Interventions:**
- Studies on puberty blockers and hormone therapy show improvements in psychological functioning and reduced gender dysphoria
- Long-term follow-up studies indicate sustained mental health benefits into adulthood

## Important Considerations

**Individual Assessment:**
- Treatment decisions involve comprehensive evaluation by qualified healthcare providers
- Care plans are individualized based on the young person's specific needs, developmental stage, and circumstances

**Multidisciplinary Approach:**
- Effective care typically involves mental health professionals, medical providers, and family support
- Treatment may include counseling, social transition, and when appropriate, medical interventions

**Quality of Evidence:**
- While the research shows consistent associations between gender-affirming care and improved outcomes, researchers continue to study long-term effects
- Major medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Endocrine Society, support evidence-based gender-affirming care

The current body of research supports that appropriate gender-affirming care, delivered by qualified professionals as part of comprehensive treatment, is associated with improved mental health outcomes and reduced suicide risk among transgender youth.
