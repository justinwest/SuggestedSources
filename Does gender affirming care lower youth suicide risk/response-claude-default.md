# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

Research consistently indicates that gender-affirming care is associated with reduced suicide risk among transgender and gender-diverse youth. Multiple peer-reviewed studies have found significant mental health benefits when young people receive appropriate gender-affirming treatment.

## Key Research Findings

Several large-scale studies have documented these protective effects:

- A 2020 study published in Pediatrics followed over 300 transgender youth and found that access to pubertal suppression was associated with lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation
- Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (2022) examining over 100 transgender youth found significant decreases in depression and suicidality following gender-affirming care
- A 2021 study in the Journal of Adolescent Health found that transgender youth with access to gender-affirming hormone therapy had 40% lower odds of recent depression and 44% lower odds of recent suicidal ideation

## Types of Gender-Affirming Care

Gender-affirming care encompasses various evidence-based interventions appropriate to different developmental stages:

- **Social affirmation**: Using chosen names, pronouns, and clothing
- **Psychological support**: Mental health counseling and family therapy
- **Medical interventions**: Pubertal suppression for adolescents, and hormone therapy for older teens
- **Surgical interventions**: Rarely performed on minors, typically reserved for adults

## Professional Medical Consensus

Major medical organizations support gender-affirming care for youth, including:
- American Academy of Pediatrics
- American Medical Association
- American Psychological Association
- Endocrine Society
- World Professional Association for Transgender Health

These organizations base their positions on systematic reviews of available evidence and clinical experience.

## Important Contextual Factors

The effectiveness of gender-affirming care occurs within broader contexts:
- Family support remains a crucial protective factor
- School and community acceptance significantly impact outcomes
- Comprehensive mental health support enhances benefits
- Individual responses to treatment can vary

The research demonstrates that when provided as part of comprehensive care by qualified healthcare providers, gender-affirming interventions are associated with improved mental health outcomes and reduced suicide risk among transgender youth.
