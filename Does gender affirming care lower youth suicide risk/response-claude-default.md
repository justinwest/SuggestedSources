# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

Research on gender-affirming care and youth suicide risk has shown consistently positive associations between access to such care and reduced suicidal ideation and attempts among transgender and gender-diverse youth.

## Key Research Findings

Multiple peer-reviewed studies have found significant correlations between gender-affirming care and improved mental health outcomes:

**Reduced Suicidal Ideation and Attempts:**
- A 2022 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that access to gender-affirming hormone therapy was associated with lower odds of recent depression and seriously considering suicide among transgender and nonbinary youth
- Research published in JAMA Psychiatry (2022) involving over 100,000 participants found that gender-affirming care during adolescence was associated with 60% lower odds of moderate or severe depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality in early adulthood

**Social Support and Family Acceptance:**
- Studies consistently show that family acceptance and support significantly reduce suicide risk among LGBTQ+ youth
- The Trevor Project's 2023 National Survey found that transgender and nonbinary youth who had access to gender-affirming spaces reported lower rates of attempting suicide

## Types of Gender-Affirming Care

Gender-affirming care encompasses various approaches depending on age and individual needs:
- Social affirmation (name, pronouns, clothing, hairstyles)
- Psychological support and counseling
- Puberty blockers for adolescents (reversible)
- Hormone therapy (typically starting in mid-to-late adolescence)
- Surgical interventions (rare in minors and typically only considered for older adolescents)

## Important Considerations

**Individual Variation:** Not all transgender youth require or desire medical interventions. Treatment approaches should be individualized based on the person's needs, developmental stage, and circumstances.

**Quality of Care:** The benefits appear most pronounced when care follows established clinical guidelines and involves experienced healthcare providers working with multidisciplinary teams.

**Ongoing Research:** While current evidence is encouraging, researchers continue to study long-term outcomes and optimal treatment approaches to further refine care standards.

## Professional Consensus

Major medical and mental health organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Medical Association, and World Professional Association for Transgender Health, support evidence-based gender-affirming care as medically necessary treatment that can significantly improve outcomes for transgender youth.

The available evidence suggests that appropriate gender-affirming care, when indicated and properly administered, is associated with reduced suicide risk and improved mental health outcomes among transgender and gender-diverse youth.
