# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

# Gender Affirming Care and Youth Suicide Risk

## Current Research Findings

Multiple peer-reviewed studies indicate that access to gender-affirming care is associated with reduced suicide risk among transgender and gender-diverse youth:

### Key Research Evidence

**Reduced Suicidal Ideation and Attempts:**
- A 2022 study published in *Journal of the American Medical Association* found that access to gender-affirming care was associated with 60% lower odds of moderate or severe depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality among transgender and nonbinary youth
- Research published in *LGBT Health* (2020) showed that transgender youth with access to pubertal suppression had lower lifetime suicidal ideation rates
- The Trevor Project's 2022 National Survey found that transgender and nonbinary youth who had access to spaces that affirmed their gender identity reported lower rates of attempting suicide

**Mechanisms of Protection:**
- Reduced gender dysphoria (distress from gender incongruence)
- Improved mental health outcomes
- Enhanced family and social support
- Increased self-esteem and quality of life

## Types of Gender-Affirming Care

Care is typically provided in developmentally appropriate stages:
- **Social transition** (name, pronouns, clothing)
- **Reversible interventions** (puberty blockers for adolescents)
- **Partially reversible treatments** (hormone therapy, typically mid-to-late teens)
- **Irreversible treatments** (surgical interventions, typically 18+)

## Important Context

- Mental health support and family acceptance are crucial components
- Care follows established clinical guidelines (WPATH, Endocrine Society, AAP)
- Treatment decisions involve careful assessment by qualified healthcare providers
- Individual outcomes vary, and comprehensive care addresses multiple factors affecting mental health

## Current Professional Consensus

Major medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Medical Association, and American Psychological Association, support evidence-based gender-affirming care as medically necessary treatment that can improve mental health outcomes for transgender youth.

The research consistently suggests that appropriate gender-affirming care, as part of comprehensive treatment, is associated with reduced suicide risk in this population.
