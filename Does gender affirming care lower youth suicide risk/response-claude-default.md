# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

Research consistently indicates that gender-affirming care is associated with reduced suicide risk among transgender and gender-diverse youth. Multiple peer-reviewed studies have documented this relationship across different types of interventions and populations.

## Key Research Findings

**Mental Health Outcomes:**
- Studies show significant reductions in suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and overall psychological distress among youth receiving gender-affirming care
- A 2022 study published in JAMA Surgery found that gender-affirming surgery was associated with a 44% reduction in psychological distress and suicidality
- Research in Journal of Adolescent Health (2020) demonstrated that access to pubertal suppression was linked to lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation

**Types of Gender-Affirming Care Studied:**
- Social affirmation (name/pronoun use, presentation changes)
- Psychological support and counseling
- Pubertal suppression for adolescents
- Hormone therapy for older adolescents
- Surgical interventions (typically for young adults)

**Population-Level Evidence:**
- Large-scale studies examining insurance claims and medical records show consistent patterns of improved mental health outcomes
- Longitudinal studies tracking youth over time demonstrate sustained benefits
- Research across different healthcare systems and countries shows similar results

## Important Considerations

**Individual Variation:**
Not all youth experience the same degree of benefit, and care must be individualized based on each person's specific needs, circumstances, and developmental stage.

**Comprehensive Approach:**
The most effective interventions typically involve multidisciplinary care including mental health support, medical care when appropriate, and family/social support systems.

**Quality of Evidence:**
While the overall body of research is substantial and growing, researchers note the need for continued long-term studies to better understand optimal care approaches and timing.

The scientific consensus, supported by major medical and mental health organizations including the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Medical Association, and World Professional Association for Transgender Health, is that appropriate gender-affirming care reduces suicide risk and improves overall mental health outcomes for transgender and gender-diverse youth.
