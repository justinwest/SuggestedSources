# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

Yes, a significant body of research and the consensus of major medical and mental health organizations indicate that gender-affirming care is associated with lower rates of suicide risk, including suicidal ideation and attempts, among transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) youth.

The response below provides a comprehensive overview of the context, the mechanisms through which this care works, key research findings, and the consensus of professional organizations.

### 1. The Context: Elevated Suicide Risk in TGD Youth

To understand the impact of gender-affirming care, it is crucial to first acknowledge the disproportionately high rates of mental health distress and suicidality among TGD youth. This elevated risk is not inherent to being transgender but is largely driven by two key factors:

*   **Gender Dysphoria:** The significant distress or impairment a person may experience when their gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth. This can manifest as intense anxiety, depression, and a feeling of being profoundly uncomfortable in one's own body.
*   **Minority Stress:** The chronic stress faced by members of stigmatized minority groups. For TGD youth, this includes experiences of discrimination, bullying, family rejection, lack of social support, and violence, all of which are major risk factors for poor mental health outcomes.

Statistics consistently highlight this crisis. For example, The Trevor Project's 2023 U.S. National Survey on the Mental Health of LGBTQ Young People found that **41% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year**, with even higher rates for transgender and nonbinary youth.

### 2. How Gender-Affirming Care Addresses These Risks

Gender-affirming care is a patient-centered, multidisciplinary approach that helps individuals align their life and physical body with their gender identity. It is not a single procedure but a spectrum of interventions, and its primary goal is to alleviate gender dysphoria and improve overall well-being. By doing so, it directly mitigates the primary drivers of suicide risk.

The key components of gender-affirming care for youth and their impact include:

*   **Social Affirmation:** This is often the first and most critical step. It involves using the youth's chosen name and pronouns, and supporting their gender expression (e.g., clothing, hairstyle).
    *   **Impact on Suicide Risk:** Studies show that having one's pronouns respected by most people in their life lowers the risk of suicide attempts by approximately half. Social affirmation provides validation, reduces feelings of isolation, and reinforces a youth's sense of self-worth.

*   **Mental Health Support:** This involves therapy with a professional knowledgeable about gender identity.
    *   **Impact on Suicide Risk:** Therapy helps youth navigate their identity, develop coping mechanisms for minority stress, address co-occurring depression and anxiety, and facilitates family support and communication, all of which are protective factors against suicide.

*   **Medical Interventions:** For youth who have reached puberty, medical interventions may be considered. These are administered according to well-established clinical guidelines and with extensive involvement from the youth, their parents, and a medical team.
    *   **Puberty Blockers (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonists):** These are reversible medications that temporarily pause pubertal development. This gives the adolescent time to explore their identity without the distress of developing secondary sex characteristics that do not align with their gender.
        *   **Impact on Suicide Risk:** Access to puberty blockers has been linked to significantly lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation. By preventing irreversible physical changes that can cause intense dysphoria, these medications can be life-saving.
    *   **Gender-Affirming Hormones (e.g., Estrogen or Testosterone):** After a period of assessment and often after the use of puberty blockers, adolescents may begin hormone therapy to develop secondary sex characteristics that align with their gender identity.
        *   **Impact on Suicide Risk:** Research consistently finds that access to gender-affirming hormones is associated with lower rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidality. A 2022 study published in *JAMA Network Open* found that access to hormone therapy in youth was associated with a nearly 40% lower odds of a recent suicide attempt.

### 3. Summary of Key Research Findings

Multiple peer-reviewed studies corroborate the link between gender-affirming care and reduced suicide risk.

*   **Tordoff et al. (2022), *JAMA Network Open*:** This study of transgender and nonbinary youth found that access to puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones was associated with **60% lower odds of moderate to severe depression** and **73% lower odds of suicidality** over a 12-month period.
*   **Green et al. (2021), *Pediatrics*:** This study found that among transgender adults who had desired puberty blockers as adolescents, those who received them had significantly lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to those who did not.
*   **The Trevor Project (2021), *Journal of Adolescent Health*:** This large-scale survey found that transgender and nonbinary youth who had received gender-affirming hormone therapy had nearly **40% lower odds of reporting a recent suicide attempt** and reporting recent depression compared to those who wanted hormones but did not receive them.
*   **de Vries et al. (2014), *Pediatrics*:** A foundational longitudinal study from the Netherlands followed 55 transgender adolescents who received puberty blockers and hormones. It found that after gender-affirming treatment, their gender dysphoria resolved and their psychological functioning improved to a level comparable with or better than their cisgender peers. While not focused solely on suicide, it demonstrated the profound improvement in well-being that reduces underlying risk factors.

### 4. Consensus from Major Medical and Mental Health Organizations

Virtually every major mainstream medical and mental health organization in the United States and across the world supports access to age-appropriate, gender-affirming care as a medically necessary intervention for improving the health and well-being of TGD individuals. These organizations explicitly state that this care reduces suicide risk.

They include:

*   American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
*   American Medical Association (AMA)
*   American Psychological Association (APA)
*   American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP)
*   Endocrine Society
*   World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH)

The **AMA**, for example, has stated that "forgoing gender-affirming care can have tragic consequences," directly linking the denial of care to adverse outcomes, including suicide.

### Conclusion

In summary, the available evidence from peer-reviewed research, clinical practice, and the consensus of leading medical organizations strongly supports the conclusion that gender-affirming care lowers suicide risk for transgender and gender-diverse youth. By alleviating gender dysphoria, fostering a sense of authenticity, and providing crucial social and medical support, these interventions directly address the root causes of the elevated rates of suicidality seen in this vulnerable population.
