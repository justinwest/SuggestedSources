# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

Yes, a significant body of research, supported by the consensus of major medical and mental health organizations, indicates that gender-affirming care is associated with a lower risk of suicide among transgender and gender-diverse youth.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the evidence, mechanisms, and professional consensus on this topic.

### What Constitutes Gender-Affirming Care?

It is important to understand that gender-affirming care is a multi-faceted, individualized approach and not a single treatment. For youth, it primarily involves the following components, typically in a step-wise manner:

*   **Social Affirmation:** This is often the first step and is fully reversible. It involves using the young person's chosen name and pronouns, and supporting their gender expression through clothing, hairstyle, and social presentation.
*   **Psychological Affirmation:** This includes counseling and therapy to explore gender identity, address the distress of gender dysphoria, and manage co-occurring mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. It often involves family therapy to build a supportive environment, which is a key protective factor.
*   **Medical Affirmation:** For adolescents, this may include:
    *   **Puberty Blockers:** These are reversible medications (GnRH agonists) that pause pubertal development. They provide time for an adolescent to explore their identity without the distress of developing secondary sex characteristics that do not align with their gender.
    *   **Hormone Therapy:** This involves taking hormones (estrogen or testosterone) to align the body with the individual's gender identity. This is a partially reversible treatment and is typically initiated in mid-to-late adolescence, following extensive assessment.
*   **Surgical Affirmation:** Surgical interventions are generally not performed on individuals under 18, with the rare exception of chest masculinization ("top surgery") for some older adolescents after thorough evaluation.

### The Evidence Linking Care to Reduced Suicide Risk

The evidence comes from multiple large-scale studies, surveys, and systematic reviews. While conducting randomized controlled trials (the gold standard in medicine) is considered unethical in this context—as it would involve denying necessary care to a vulnerable group—the consistency of findings across observational and longitudinal studies is strong.

**1. Large-Scale Surveys and Cohort Studies:**

*   **The Trevor Project's National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health:** This annual survey consistently finds a strong correlation between access to gender-affirming care and lower suicide risk. The 2023 survey found that transgender and nonbinary youth who had access to gender-affirming hormone therapy had lower odds of reporting a recent suicide attempt. Similarly, youth whose pronouns were respected by the people they lived with reported attempting suicide at half the rate of those whose pronouns were not respected.
*   **Tordoff et al. (2022) in *JAMA Network Open*:** This study followed a cohort of transgender and nonbinary youth who received gender-affirming care (puberty blockers or hormones). It found that over a 12-month period, receiving this care was associated with a **60% lower odds of moderate to severe depression** and a **73% lower odds of suicidality**.
*   **Green et al. (2021) in *PLOS ONE*:** A study from The Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law surveyed transgender adults. It found that those who had received puberty blockers during adolescence had significantly lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to those who wanted them but could not access them.
*   **Jack Turban et al. (2020) in *Pediatrics*:** This study analyzed data from the U.S. Transgender Survey and found that among transgender adults, access to puberty blockers during adolescence was associated with lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation and past-month severe psychological distress.

**2. Systematic Reviews:**

*   A 2020 systematic review published in the *British Medical Journal (BMJ)* examined the effects of puberty blockers and hormone therapy on the mental health of transgender adolescents. The review concluded that these medical interventions are associated with improvements in mental health, including a reduction in suicidal ideation.

### Mechanisms: Why Does Affirming Care Lower Suicide Risk?

The high rates of suicide risk among transgender youth are not inherent to being transgender. Rather, they are linked to the immense stress of gender dysphoria, social stigma, discrimination, and lack of acceptance. Gender-affirming care works by directly addressing these core stressors.

*   **Alleviating Gender Dysphoria:** Gender dysphoria is the significant distress or impairment caused by the incongruence between one's experienced gender and assigned sex. Medical and social affirmation helps to align the body and social role with one's identity, which is the primary treatment for alleviating this distress.
*   **Improving Mental Health:** By reducing dysphoria, affirming care leads to measurable decreases in depression and anxiety, which are major risk factors for suicide.
*   **Fostering Hope and Authenticity:** Affirming care allows a young person to see a viable future for themselves. It validates their identity and enables them to live more authentically, which is fundamental to psychological well-being.
*   **Strengthening Social and Familial Support:** The process of seeking affirming care often involves building a support system of family, friends, and healthcare providers. This support is one of the most powerful protective factors against suicide for any young person, but especially for transgender youth.

### Consensus of Major Medical Organizations

There is a broad and long-standing consensus among major medical, pediatric, psychological, and endocrine associations in the United States and worldwide that gender-affirming care is medically necessary, safe, and effective for treating gender dysphoria. These organizations explicitly state that this care improves mental health outcomes and reduces suicide risk.

Organizations supporting this consensus include:

*   American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
*   American Medical Association (AMA)
*   American Psychological Association (APA)
*   American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP)
*   The Endocrine Society
*   World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH)

### Conclusion

In summary, the available body of scientific evidence strongly indicates a positive association between access to gender-affirming care and a reduction in suicide risk for transgender and gender-diverse youth. This care, which ranges from social support to medical interventions, works by alleviating the profound distress of gender dysphoria, improving overall mental health, and fostering a sense of hope and authenticity. This conclusion is reinforced by the unified position of nearly every major relevant medical and psychological association.
