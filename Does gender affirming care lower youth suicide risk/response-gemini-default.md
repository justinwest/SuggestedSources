# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

A substantial and growing body of research indicates that gender-affirming care is associated with significantly lower rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among transgender and gender-diverse youth. The consensus among major medical and mental health organizations in the United States and worldwide is that this care is medically necessary, safe, and effective for improving the mental health and well-being of this vulnerable population.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the evidence, the types of care involved, and the conclusions of professional organizations.

### What is Gender-Affirming Care?

Gender-affirming care is a supportive, evidence-based model of healthcare that addresses the physical, mental, and social health needs of transgender and gender-diverse individuals. It is not a single procedure but a spectrum of care that is tailored to each individual's age, needs, and goals. For youth, this care is provided by a multidisciplinary team of medical doctors, mental health professionals, and social workers, and it typically involves a step-by-step approach.

*   **Social Affirmation:** This is often the first step and is fully reversible. It involves adopting a name, pronouns, and gender expression (e.g., clothing, hairstyle) that align with one's gender identity.
*   **Psychological Support:** This includes counseling for the youth and their family to explore gender identity, manage distress, and develop coping strategies. It is a foundational component of care.
*   **Puberty Blockers (GnRH Agonists):** For adolescents at the onset of puberty, these are medications that temporarily pause pubertal development. They are considered fully reversible. Their primary purpose is to alleviate the distress caused by the development of secondary sex characteristics that do not align with a youth's gender identity and to provide time for the youth and their family to make decisions about further steps without the pressure of a rapidly changing body.
*   **Gender-Affirming Hormones (Testosterone or Estrogen):** For older adolescents, this involves taking hormones to induce the physical changes of the gender they identify with. The effects are partially reversible. This step is only taken after extensive assessment and with informed consent from the adolescent and their guardians.
*   **Surgical Interventions:** Surgical options are generally not performed on minors, with the rare exception of chest surgery for some older adolescents who have been on hormones for a significant period and have persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria.

### Key Research Findings on Suicide Risk

Multiple peer-reviewed studies have demonstrated a strong link between access to gender-affirming care and reduced suicide risk.

1.  **The Trevor Project’s National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health:** This is one of the largest and most frequently cited data sources.
    *   The 2023 survey found that **41%** of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, with transgender and nonbinary youth reporting higher rates than their cisgender LGBQ peers.
    *   Crucially, the survey consistently finds that affirmation is a powerful protective factor. Transgender and nonbinary youth who reported that their pronouns were respected by all or most of the people they lived with attempted suicide at **half the rate** of those who did not have their pronouns respected.
    *   Regarding medical care, the 2022 survey found that transgender and nonbinary youth who wanted and received gender-affirming hormones or puberty blockers reported **lower rates of attempting suicide** in the past year.

2.  **Study in *JAMA Network Open* (2022):** This study, led by Tordoff et al., followed transgender and nonbinary youth aged 13-20 who received puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones.
    *   The researchers found that over a 12-month period, receiving this medical care was associated with **60% lower odds of moderate to severe depression** and **73% lower odds of suicidality**.

3.  **Study in *Pediatrics* (2020):** This study by Green et al. looked at data from a large survey of transgender adults, asking them to reflect on their adolescent experiences.
    *   It found that among those who had wanted puberty blockers during adolescence, those who were able to receive them had **significantly lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation** compared to those who wanted them but could not access them.

4.  **Study in the *Journal of Adolescent Health* (2022):** This study analyzed data from over 27,000 transgender and gender-diverse adults.
    *   It found that individuals who received gender-affirming care, including puberty blockers and hormones, in adolescence had **lower odds of past-year suicidal ideation and past-month severe psychological distress** as adults compared to those who wanted care but did not receive it until adulthood.

### Mechanisms: Why Does Affirming Care Reduce Suicide Risk?

The protective effect of gender-affirming care is understood through several key mechanisms:

*   **Alleviation of Gender Dysphoria:** Gender dysphoria is the significant distress a person may feel when their assigned sex at birth does not match their gender identity. This distress is a primary driver of depression, anxiety, and suicidality. Affirming care directly addresses and relieves this core source of pain.
*   **Improved Mental Health and Self-Esteem:** By allowing a young person to live as their authentic self, affirming care can lead to dramatic improvements in self-worth, body image, and overall psychological well-being.
*   **Increased Hope for the Future:** For many transgender youth, the physical changes of puberty can feel like a devastating and permanent trap. Puberty blockers and hormones offer a pathway to a future where their body can align with their identity, fostering a sense of hope that is critical for mental health.
*   **Validation and Support:** Accessing affirming care is a tangible sign of acceptance from family, caregivers, and the medical community. This social support is, by itself, one of the most powerful protective factors against suicide for any young person, but it is especially critical for transgender youth who face high rates of rejection and bullying.

### Consensus of Major Medical and Mental Health Organizations

There is a broad and longstanding consensus among nearly every major medical and mental health organization in the United States and many internationally that gender-affirming care is evidence-based and medically necessary. These organizations include:

*   American Medical Association (AMA)
*   American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
*   The Endocrine Society
*   American Psychological Association (APA)
*   American Psychiatric Association
*   American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP)
*   World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH)

These organizations have conducted extensive reviews of the available scientific literature and have concluded that the benefits of gender-affirming care for mental health and suicide prevention far outweigh the potential risks. They affirm that denying this care can cause significant harm.

### Conclusion

In summary, a strong and consistent body of scientific evidence, supported by the consensus of leading medical experts, demonstrates that access to gender-affirming care is associated with a significant reduction in depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts among transgender and gender-diverse youth. The research indicates that social affirmation, puberty blockers, and hormones all serve as critical, and often life-saving, interventions that improve mental health by alleviating gender dysphoria, fostering self-esteem, and providing a tangible sense of hope and support.
