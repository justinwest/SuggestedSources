# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

Yes, a significant and growing body of research from major medical and mental health organizations indicates that access to gender-affirming care is associated with lower rates of depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts among transgender and gender-diverse youth.

Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the evidence, the components of care, and the consensus within the medical community.

### 1. What is Gender-Affirming Care?

Gender-affirming care is a model of healthcare that supports and affirms an individual's gender identity. It is patient-centered and involves a multidisciplinary team. For youth, it is provided in a careful, staged manner and can include several components:

*   **Social Affirmation:** This is often the first step and is fully reversible. It involves using the young person's chosen name and pronouns, and supporting their choices in clothing, hairstyle, and gender expression.
*   **Psychological Support:** This includes counseling for the youth and their family to explore gender identity, address the distress of gender dysphoria, and navigate social and emotional challenges. This is not to be confused with conversion therapy, which is widely condemned as harmful.
*   **Medical Interventions:** These are prescribed based on established guidelines from organizations like the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and the Endocrine Society.
    *   **Puberty Blockers (GnRH Agonists):** These are reversible medications that temporarily pause pubertal development. They are used to give adolescents more time to explore their gender identity without the distress of developing secondary sex characteristics that do not align with it. This pause alleviates significant distress and its effects are reversed when the medication is stopped.
    *   **Hormone Therapy:** This involves taking testosterone or estrogen to develop secondary sex characteristics that align with one's gender identity. Some effects are reversible, while others are not. This step is typically considered only after an adolescent has demonstrated a consistent and persistent gender identity and, where appropriate, after the use of puberty blockers.
    *   **Surgical Interventions:** Surgeries are very rarely performed on individuals under 18, with the exception of some older adolescents seeking chest masculinization (top surgery) after extensive evaluation. Genital surgeries are almost exclusively reserved for adults.

### 2. The Evidence Linking Care to Reduced Suicide Risk

Multiple peer-reviewed studies have demonstrated a strong link between access to affirming care and improved mental health outcomes, including reduced suicidality.

*   **The Trevor Project’s National Survey:** This is one of the largest surveys of LGBTQ youth. The 2023 survey found that transgender and nonbinary youth who had access to gender-affirming care (including hormones) reported lower rates of recent suicide attempts. Specifically, receiving hormone therapy was associated with nearly 40% lower odds of a recent suicide attempt.
*   **The Power of Pronouns and Names:** The same research from The Trevor Project highlights the impact of social affirmation. Youth who had their pronouns respected by all or most of the people in their lives attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not.
*   **Puberty Blockers and Hormone Therapy:** A landmark 2022 study published in *JAMA Network Open* followed a cohort of transgender and nonbinary youth aged 13-20. It found that the initiation of puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones was associated with a **60% reduction in the odds of moderate to severe depression** and a **73% reduction in the odds of suicidality** over the 12-month follow-up period.
*   **Long-Term Benefits:** A 2020 study in the journal *Pediatrics* surveyed transgender adults and found that those who had received puberty blockers during adolescence had significantly lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to those who had wanted them but could not access them.

### 3. Mechanisms: Why Does Affirming Care Reduce Suicide Risk?

The protective effect of gender-affirming care is understood to work through several interconnected mechanisms:

*   **Alleviating Gender Dysphoria:** Gender dysphoria—the clinical term for the significant distress a person may feel when their gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth—is a primary driver of anxiety, depression, and suicidality. Gender-affirming care directly addresses and alleviates this distress by helping to align a person’s body and social presentation with their identity.
*   **Fostering Hope and a Positive Future:** Accessing care provides a tangible pathway forward, countering feelings of hopelessness. It allows a young person to envision a future where they can live authentically and comfortably as themselves.
*   **Validating Identity and Reducing Stigma:** When a young person’s identity is validated by family, peers, and medical professionals, it counteracts the harmful effects of social stigma, rejection, and discrimination. This external validation is a powerful protective factor for mental health.
*   **Improving Family and Social Support:** The process of seeking care often involves family support. This support itself is one of the most significant protective factors against suicide for all youth, and especially for transgender youth.

### 4. Consensus from Major Medical and Mental Health Organizations

There is a broad consensus among every major medical and mental health association in the United States that gender-affirming care is medically necessary and life-saving. These organizations include:

*   American Medical Association (AMA)
*   American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
*   American Psychological Association (APA)
*   American Psychiatric Association
*   The Endocrine Society
*   World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH)

These organizations have issued policy statements and clinical guidelines based on the existing evidence, concluding that denying or restricting access to this care can cause significant harm to the mental and physical health of transgender youth.

### Conclusion

The weight of the available scientific evidence strongly supports the conclusion that gender-affirming care is a crucial, and often life-saving, intervention that is associated with a significant reduction in suicide risk for transgender and gender-diverse youth. The research demonstrates that all forms of affirmation—from using correct names and pronouns to providing access to medical interventions like puberty blockers and hormones—contribute to improved mental health outcomes and a lower likelihood of depression and suicidality.
