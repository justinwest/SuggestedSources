# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

A substantial body of research, supported by the consensus of major medical and mental health organizations, indicates that gender-affirming care is associated with significantly lower rates of suicide risk, including suicidal ideation and attempts, among transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) youth.

Below is a comprehensive overview of the evidence, the mechanisms involved, and the consensus of professional organizations.

### What is Gender-Affirming Care?

Gender-affirming care is a model of healthcare that supports and affirms an individual's gender identity. For youth, it is a patient-centered, multidisciplinary approach that is administered in a slow, stepwise, and reversible-to-irreversible fashion. It can include several components:

*   **Social Affirmation:** This involves non-medical changes, such as using the chosen name and pronouns, and adopting gender-affirming clothing and hairstyles. This is often the first step and can occur at any age.
*   **Psychological Support:** Counseling and therapy to help youth and their families navigate social transition, explore gender identity, and address any co-occurring mental health conditions.
*   **Medical Interventions:**
    *   **Puberty Blockers (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonists):** These are fully reversible medications that temporarily pause pubertal development. They provide time for an adolescent to explore their gender identity without the distress of developing secondary sex characteristics that do not align with their identity.
    *   **Hormone Therapy (Estrogen or Testosterone):** This involves taking hormones to induce physical changes that align with an individual's gender identity. Some effects are reversible, while others are not. This is typically initiated in mid-to-late adolescence, following extensive assessment.
    *   **Surgical Interventions:** Surgeries are generally not performed on minors, with the rare exception of chest masculinization ("top surgery") for older adolescents who have been on hormone therapy and have persistent gender dysphoria.

### Key Evidence and Research Findings

Multiple peer-reviewed studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between access to gender-affirming care and improved mental health outcomes, including reduced suicidality.

1.  **The Trevor Project's National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health:** This is one of the largest surveys of its kind.
    *   The 2023 survey found that transgender and nonbinary youth who had access to gender-affirming hormone therapy had lower odds of attempting suicide in the past year compared to those who wanted it but did not receive it.
    *   Similarly, transgender and nonbinary youth who reported that their pronouns were respected by all or most of the people they lived with were half as likely to attempt suicide compared to those whose pronouns were not respected.

2.  **Peer-Reviewed Journal Studies:**
    *   A landmark 2022 study published in ***JAMA Network Open*** (Tordoff et al.) followed transgender and nonbinary youth aged 13-20. It found that access to puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones was associated with **60% lower odds of moderate to severe depression** and **73% lower odds of suicidality** over a 12-month period.
    *   A 2021 study in the ***Journal of Adolescent Health*** (Green et al.) found that access to puberty blockers during adolescence was associated with lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation among transgender adults.
    *   A 2023 study in the journal ***Pediatrics*** (Chen et al.), which analyzed a large cohort of over 1,500 transgender youth, found that the initiation of gender-affirming medical care (puberty blockers or hormones) was associated with a significant decrease in depression and suicidality.
    *   Research has shown that even social affirmation alone has a protective effect. A 2016 study in ***Pediatrics*** found that transgender youth who were supported in their social transition and could use their chosen name and pronouns in all contexts had rates of depression and anxiety that were comparable to their cisgender peers.

### Mechanisms: Why Does Affirming Care Reduce Suicide Risk?

The protective effect of gender-affirming care is understood through several interconnected mechanisms:

*   **Alleviation of Gender Dysphoria:** Gender dysphoria—the significant distress or impairment resulting from the incongruence between one's assigned sex at birth and one's gender identity—is a primary driver of poor mental health in TGD youth. Affirming care directly addresses and alleviates this distress.
*   **Reduction of Minority Stress:** TGD youth experience high levels of minority stress, which stems from stigma, discrimination, harassment, and family or social rejection. Affirming care, especially when supported by family and community, validates their identity and can buffer the negative impacts of this stress.
*   **Improved Self-Esteem and Body Image:** By allowing an individual's physical characteristics to align more closely with their gender identity, medical interventions can drastically improve body image, self-worth, and overall psychological well-being.
*   **Fostering Hope for the Future:** Access to care provides a tangible pathway forward, allowing youth to envision a future where they can live authentically and comfortably. This sense of hope is a powerful antidote to the despair that often fuels suicidal thoughts.

### Consensus of Major Medical and Mental Health Organizations

Virtually every major medical and mental health organization in the United States and across the world supports access to age-appropriate, gender-affirming care for transgender and gender-diverse youth, citing its critical role in reducing suicide risk. These organizations include:

*   **American Academy of Pediatrics**
*   **American Medical Association**
*   **American Psychological Association**
*   **American Psychiatric Association**
*   **Endocrine Society**
*   **World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH)**

These organizations have based their positions on the extensive body of evidence showing that this care is medically necessary and life-saving. They emphasize that withholding or denying such care can cause significant harm.

### Conclusion

In summary, the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence and the consensus of leading medical experts indicate that gender-affirming care is a crucial, and often life-saving, intervention for transgender and gender-diverse youth. By alleviating gender dysphoria, reducing minority stress, and fostering a sense of hope and authenticity, access to social, psychological, and medical affirmation is directly associated with a significant reduction in depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts.
