Gender-affirming care (GAC) for transgender and nonbinary youth typically includes social affirmation, puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and in rare cases for adolescents, surgical interventions. It is often promoted as a means to alleviate gender dysphoria and reduce associated mental health risks, including suicide. However, the question of whether GAC specifically lowers suicide risk in youth is complex and contested, with mixed evidence from available studies. While some observational research suggests associations between GAC and improved mental health outcomes (including reduced suicidality), critics highlight methodological flaws, small sample sizes, lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and potential confounding factors. Major reviews have concluded that the evidence base is weak and inconclusive, urging caution in its application to minors [1][3]. Below, I summarize the key evidence from the provided sources, supplemented by a few additional high-quality references for completeness and accuracy (e.g., to address gaps in longitudinal data or international guidelines). Overall, while GAC may benefit some youth, there is no robust, causal evidence that it definitively lowers suicide risk across the board, and more rigorous research is needed.

### Evidence Suggesting Potential Benefits
Several studies report associations between GAC and reduced suicidal ideation or attempts among transgender youth. For instance, a 2020 study published in *Pediatrics* examined 105 transgender youth receiving pubertal suppression (a form of GAC) and found that those who accessed it had significantly lower rates of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to those who desired but did not receive it (51% vs. 75%) [1]. The authors attributed this to the alleviation of distress from unwanted pubertal changes, though they noted limitations like the cross-sectional design and reliance on self-reported data.

Similarly, a 2022 study in *JAMA Network Open* followed 104 transgender and nonbinary youth (ages 13-20) receiving GAC, including hormones and puberty blockers. It reported improvements in depression, anxiety, and life satisfaction after 12 months, with a decrease in suicidal ideation from 45% to 31% [6]. A 2023 longitudinal study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* tracked 315 transgender youth (ages 12-20) on hormone therapy for two years and found sustained improvements in psychosocial functioning, including reduced depression and anxiety scores, though it did not directly measure suicide risk [7]. These findings align with guidelines from organizations like the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), which endorse GAC for youth based on observational evidence of mental health benefits [10].

Proponents argue that withholding GAC could exacerbate suicide risk, given high baseline rates of suicidality in transgender youth (e.g., up to 40-50% reporting attempts in surveys) [11]. However, these studies are often limited by short follow-up periods, lack of control groups, and potential selection bias (e.g., participants are those who persist in seeking care).

### Evidence Questioning Benefits or Highlighting Risks
Conversely, several sources raise doubts about the strength of these claims, pointing to inconsistent results, publication biases, and a lack of evidence for long-term suicide risk reduction. A critical analysis by journalist Jesse Singal examined a 2022 study from the Seattle Children's Hospital's gender clinic, which initially claimed that puberty blockers and hormones improved mental health in transgender youth. However, Singal's review of the underlying data revealed no statistically significant improvements in depression, anxiety, or suicidality after treatment, suggesting the published findings may have overstated benefits [2]. This highlights broader concerns about "spin" in research on this topic.

The 2022 interim report from the Cass Review, an independent evaluation commissioned by NHS England, conducted a systematic review of evidence on GAC for youth and found it to be of "very low" quality overall. It noted that while some studies show short-term mental health improvements, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that GAC reduces suicide risk, and long-term outcomes (including potential regret or detransition) are poorly understood. The report recommended restricting puberty blockers to research settings due to uncertainties [3]. The final Cass Review in 2024 reinforced these findings, leading to policy changes in the UK, such as banning puberty blockers for minors outside trials [12].

A 2025 review by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) similarly critiqued the evidence base, concluding that studies on GAC for pediatric gender dysphoria suffer from methodological weaknesses, including small samples and lack of RCTs. It found no clear evidence that GAC lowers suicide rates and emphasized risks like bone density loss from puberty blockers [4]. An anonymous co-author of this report, writing in *The Washington Post*, argued that the document was suppressed due to political pressures and that the science does not support broad use of GAC in youth [8].

Additionally, a 2025 study in *The Journal of Sexual Medicine* analyzed national database data on over 3,000 individuals post-gender-affirming surgery (including some under 18) and found no significant reduction in mental health risks, including suicide attempts, compared to controls. In fact, it reported elevated risks in some subgroups, though the study focused more on adults [5]. Broader critiques, such as an article in *The Atlantic*, argue that misinformation has inflated claims about GAC's role in preventing youth suicides, noting that suicide rates in transgender youth remain high even after treatment and that other factors (e.g., bullying, family support) may be more influential [9]. A large Finnish study (not among the provided sources but added for accuracy) tracked over 2,000 gender-dysphoric youth and found that while suicide rates were elevated, medical transition did not significantly reduce them compared to psychiatric treatment alone [13].

### Key Limitations and Broader Context
The debate is hampered by the absence of RCTs, which are ethically challenging in this area due to the potential harms of withholding treatment [3][12]. Most evidence is correlational, making it difficult to establish causality—improvements could stem from GAC itself, supportive environments, or natural maturation. Suicide risk in transgender youth is multifactorial, influenced by stigma, mental health comorbidities, and access to general care [11]. Detransition rates, though low (around 1-8% in studies), and potential long-term effects (e.g., infertility) add to the caution advised by reviews like Cass and DHHS [3][4].

In summary, while some studies associate GAC with reduced suicidal ideation in youth, major reviews find the evidence inconclusive and of low quality, with no definitive proof that it lowers overall suicide risk. Professional bodies like the American Academy of Pediatrics support GAC [11], but international shifts (e.g., in Sweden, Finland, and the UK) toward more restrictive approaches reflect growing skepticism [12][13]. Families and clinicians should weigh individualized risks and benefits, ideally with comprehensive mental health support. Further high-quality, long-term research is essential to clarify these effects.
