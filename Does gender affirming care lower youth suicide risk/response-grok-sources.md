Gender-affirming care (GAC) for transgender and gender-diverse youth typically includes social affirmation (e.g., using preferred names and pronouns), puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and, in rare cases for adolescents, surgeries. It is often promoted as a means to alleviate gender dysphoria and reduce mental health risks, including suicide. However, the question of whether GAC lowers suicide risk in youth is complex and contested, with evidence drawn from observational studies, reviews, and critiques. Research on this topic is limited by methodological challenges, such as small sample sizes, lack of randomized controlled trials (due to ethical concerns), short follow-up periods, and reliance on self-reported outcomes like suicidal ideation rather than completed suicides (which are rare events). Below, I summarize the key evidence from the suggested sources, supplemented by additional high-quality references for completeness and accuracy. Overall, while some studies suggest associations between GAC and reduced suicidal ideation or mental health improvements, systematic reviews highlight weak evidence, potential biases, and the need for caution. No high-quality evidence definitively proves that GAC causally lowers suicide risk in youth.

### Evidence Suggesting GAC May Lower Suicide Risk
Several studies report positive associations between aspects of GAC and improved mental health outcomes, including lower rates of suicidal ideation or attempts. For instance, a 2020 study analyzing data from the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey found that transgender adults who had access to puberty blockers during adolescence reported lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to those who wanted but did not receive them (adjusted odds ratio: 0.3) [1]. The authors concluded that pubertal suppression may protect against suicidality, though the study was retrospective and relied on self-reported data from adults reflecting on their youth.

Similarly, a 2022 prospective cohort study of 104 transgender and nonbinary youth (ages 13-20) receiving GAC (including hormones) at a U.S. clinic found significant reductions in depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation after 12 months. Specifically, the proportion reporting recent suicidal ideation dropped from 45% at baseline to 22% at follow-up, with improvements attributed to GAC [6]. Another 2023 study followed 315 transgender youth (ages 12-20) receiving hormone therapy for two years and reported modest improvements in depression, anxiety, and life satisfaction, with positive psychosocial functioning aligning closer to cisgender peers [7]. These findings suggest potential benefits, but the studies lacked control groups and could not rule out placebo effects, regression to the mean, or other confounders.

### Evidence Suggesting GAC Does Not Clearly Lower Suicide Risk or That Evidence Is Insufficient
Critiques and systematic reviews paint a more cautious picture, emphasizing that many positive studies have flaws and that evidence for reducing suicide risk is weak or inconclusive. A detailed analysis of a prominent Dutch clinic's data (often cited as foundational for youth GAC) revealed that initial claims of mental health improvements from puberty blockers and hormones were overstated. Researchers at the clinic found no significant improvements in key metrics like depression or suicidality, but a subsequent published study selectively emphasized positive outcomes, raising concerns about publication bias [2].

The 2022 interim report from the UK's Cass Review, an independent evaluation commissioned by NHS England, examined evidence on youth gender services and concluded that the quality of research on puberty blockers and hormones is "very low," with "no good evidence on the long-term outcomes" for mental health, including suicide risk. It noted high rates of co-occurring conditions (e.g., autism, trauma) that may influence outcomes and recommended restricting puberty blockers to research settings due to uncertainties [3]. The final Cass Review in 2024 reinforced this, finding no clear evidence that GAC reduces suicide risk and highlighting risks like bone density loss; as a result, NHS England largely halted puberty blockers for minors outside trials [10].

A 2024 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) review of evidence on pediatric gender dysphoria similarly concluded that studies supporting GAC are of low quality, with insufficient data on long-term suicide outcomes. It criticized reliance on short-term, uncontrolled studies and noted that suicide rates in transgender youth remain elevated even after interventions [4]. An opinion piece in The Washington Post critiqued this review for its anonymous authorship and potential biases but acknowledged the broader debate on evidence gaps [8].

Regarding surgical interventions (less common in youth), a 2025 national database study of over 1,500 transgender individuals post-gender-affirming surgery found no significant reduction in suicide attempts or psychiatric emergencies compared to pre-surgery rates, though this primarily involved adults [5]. An Atlantic article discussing the U.S. Supreme Court case United States v. Skrmetti (which upheld Tennessee's ban on youth GAC) highlighted expert testimony that evidence for suicide risk reduction is "remarkably thin," with some studies showing no benefit or even potential harm from over-medicalization [9].

Additional systematic reviews from other countries align with these concerns. For example, Finland's 2020 evidence review found "insufficient evidence" that hormones reduce suicide risk in youth, leading to restrictions on medical interventions for minors [11]. Sweden's 2022 review similarly concluded that risks outweigh benefits for most youth, citing no proven reduction in suicidality and recommending psychotherapy first [12]. A 2024 Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine analysis of over 60 studies found that while suicidal ideation may decrease in some short-term studies, there is no reliable evidence of reduced completed suicides, and methodological weaknesses (e.g., high dropout rates) undermine claims [13].

### Overall Assessment
The evidence is mixed and of generally low quality, making it difficult to conclude definitively that GAC lowers youth suicide risk. Positive associations in some studies [1,6,7] are promising but often come from non-randomized, short-term research that cannot establish causation—improvements could stem from supportive care, natural maturation, or expectancy effects rather than the interventions themselves. In contrast, independent reviews [3,4,10-12] consistently highlight insufficient evidence, potential harms, and the need for better long-term data. Suicide risk in transgender youth is indeed elevated (due to factors like minority stress and discrimination), but claims that withholding GAC leads to inevitable suicide are not supported by robust data [13]. Experts recommend a cautious, individualized approach, prioritizing mental health support and exploring non-medical options first. More rigorous, longitudinal research is urgently needed to clarify these effects.
