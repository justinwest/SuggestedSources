# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

Does gender-affirming medical care (puberty blockers in early puberty and/or gender-affirming hormones in later adolescence) reduce suicide risk in young people?  
The short answer is:  Observational studies suggest a possible reduction, but all available data are of low or very-low certainty, and the best recent evidence reviews conclude that we still cannot say with confidence that gender-affirming care causally lowers suicidality in youth.

1. What the primary studies show  

a. Puberty blockers (GnRHa)  
• Turban et al. analysed a U.S. survey of 20 619 transgender adults; among the 104 who had received puberty blockers in adolescence, the prevalence of lifetime suicidal ideation was lower (55%) than in those who wanted but did not receive them (57%) and markedly lower for “serious” ideation (4 % vs 13 %) after adjustment for confounders [1].  
Limitations: retrospective self-report, small treated sample (n = 89 after exclusions), no data on suicide attempts or deaths, and the treated group differed in multiple socio-economic factors that were only partly adjusted for.

b. Puberty blockers and/or hormones – prospective clinic cohorts  
• Tordoff et al. followed 104 US youth (13-20 yr) for one year. Receipt of blockers or hormones was associated with lower odds of moderate-to-severe depression (adjusted OR 0.40) and of self-reported suicidal thoughts (aOR 0.30) compared with youth on the waiting list [2].  
Limitations: non-randomised, small, short follow-up, suicidality measured by one questionnaire item, a majority were already receiving psychotherapy.  
• Another report from the same clinic (described in Singal’s article) found no clinically relevant mental-health improvement in the first year; results were not formally published, illustrating the sensitivity of findings to analytic choices [6].

c. Longer-term mental-health outcomes after gender-affirming hormones  
A 2023 longitudinal study of 315 minors starting hormones found no statistically significant change in suicide attempts after two years, although depression scores fell modestly [7]. Again, the study was observational and uncontrolled.

2. What the evidence reviews say  

• The Cass Review (independent NHS England review, 2022 interim report) rated the evidence for puberty blockers and hormones in reducing self-harm or suicidality as “very low certainty”; it concluded that “it is not possible to determine whether the treatment itself reduces or increases suicide risk” and called for randomised or robust comparative studies [4].  

• The systematic evidence review prepared for the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (2022 draft) reached the same judgment: “evidence on suicidality is insufficient to draw conclusions; all studies are observational with serious risk of bias” [5].  

3. Key methodological problems that keep the certainty low  

• Absence of randomised or well-matched control groups (treatment is given to the most distressed youth, creating confounding by indication).  
• Small treated samples and short follow-up windows relative to the typical time-course of suicidal behaviour.  
• Use of self-reported suicidal thoughts rather than recorded suicide attempts or deaths.  
• Attrition and publication bias (negative findings are less likely to be published; see Singal for one example [6]).  

4. Bottom-line assessment  

• A handful of clinic-based observational studies find associations between gender-affirming care and lower measured suicidal ideation in the first one to two years.  
• Because of the study designs and limitations above, higher-level reviews (Cass, HHS) judge the certainty of a protective effect to be very low.  
• Thus, current evidence is consistent with—but does not yet prove—a reduction in youth suicide risk; stronger comparative research is needed to establish whether the effect is real, its magnitude, and for whom it occurs.
