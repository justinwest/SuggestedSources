# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

Transgender youth experience disproportionately high rates of suicidal ideation and mental distress, often linked to gender dysphoria and social stigma ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35212746//#:~:text=Importance%3A%20Transgender%20and%20nonbinary%20,with%20mental%20health%20immediately%20after)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35212746//#:~:text=gender%20identity%20question%20%283.8,0.65%29%20among%20youths)). Gender-affirming care (GAC) – which can include puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and supportive counseling – is intended to alleviate dysphoria and improve mental health. Several studies suggest that access to gender-affirming medical care correlates with *lower* levels of suicidal ideation among transgender youth. For example, a 2020 study in *Pediatrics* found that transgender adults who had received puberty suppression during adolescence (among those who wanted it) had significantly decreased odds of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to those who wanted this treatment but did not receive it ([publications.aap.org](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/145/2/e20191725/68259/Pubertal-Suppression-for-Transgender-Youth-and?autologincheck=redirected#:~:text=access%20to%20this%20safe%20and,5)). Similarly, a 2022 prospective study of 104 transgender and nonbinary adolescents observed that after one year, youths who initiated puberty blockers or hormone therapy had **73% lower odds of self-reported suicidality** than those who did not receive these interventions ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35212746//#:~:text=After%20adjustment%20for%20temporal%20trends,CI%2C%200.41%2C%202.51)). In other words, participants receiving gender-affirming hormones showed substantial improvements in mood and a reduction in self-harm thoughts over the 12-month period. Another recent study reported in the *New England Journal of Medicine* tracked 315 transgender youths over two years of hormone treatment and found overall **improvements in psychosocial functioning**, including increased life satisfaction and decreased depression and anxiety symptoms ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36652355/#:~:text=treatment,suicide%20occurred%20in%202%20participants)). This 2-year study noted that as youths’ appearance became more congruent with their gender identity, measures of positive affect rose while depression and anxiety fell ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36652355/#:~:text=treatment,suicide%20occurred%20in%202%20participants)). These findings align with many clinicians’ observations that relieving gender dysphoria through medical affirmation can improve a young person’s mental well-being and potentially reduce their risk of suicidal behavior [1]. 

However, it is important to recognize that the evidence base has limitations, and not all findings are uniformly positive. The above studies were observational (not randomized controlled trials) and had relatively short follow-up periods ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/11/transgender-care-pediatric-transition/#:~:text=research%20is%20inadequate%20to%20validate,significantly%20from%20the%20studied%20protocol)). This makes it difficult to determine cause and effect definitively – the improvements in mental health could be influenced by factors like family support or therapy accompanying treatment, rather than hormones alone. In fact, a critical analysis by journalist Jesse Singal highlighted that in one clinic’s data, **no statistically significant mental health improvement** was seen in youths who went on puberty blockers or hormones, even though the published study claimed benefits ([feministlegal.org](https://feministlegal.org/researchers-found-puberty-blockers-and-hormones-didnt-improve-trans-kids-mental-health-at-their-clinic-then-they-published-a-study-claiming-the-opposite-updated/#:~:text=,of%20the%20authors%2C%20is%20false)). He noted that many participants still had alarmingly high rates of depression and self-harm after treatment, and one of the study’s authors privately confirmed that **there was no measurable improvement over time among the treated youth** ([feministlegal.org](https://feministlegal.org/researchers-found-puberty-blockers-and-hormones-didnt-improve-trans-kids-mental-health-at-their-clinic-then-they-published-a-study-claiming-the-opposite-updated/#:~:text=,of%20the%20authors%2C%20is%20false)) ([feministlegal.org](https://feministlegal.org/researchers-found-puberty-blockers-and-hormones-didnt-improve-trans-kids-mental-health-at-their-clinic-then-they-published-a-study-claiming-the-opposite-updated/#:~:text=%3E%20I%20wanted%20to%20double,statistical%20evidence%20that%20the%20kids)). This example underscores how results can vary and be interpreted differently, especially when studies lack control groups. High dropout rates in some research (with more untreated youth leaving studies early) further complicate the picture ([feministlegal.org](https://feministlegal.org/researchers-found-puberty-blockers-and-hormones-didnt-improve-trans-kids-mental-health-at-their-clinic-then-they-published-a-study-claiming-the-opposite-updated/#:~:text=were%20treated%20left%20the%20study%2C,by%20the%20researchers%20would%20have)).

Broad systematic reviews by health authorities have raised even greater caution. An independent **NHS-commissioned review in England (Cass Review, 2022)** concluded that current evidence is insufficient to prove that puberty blockers and hormone therapy are effective in improving mental health outcomes for gender-dysphoric youth ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/11/transgender-care-pediatric-transition/#:~:text=The%20HHS%20document%20concurs%20with,Instead)). The Cass interim report found “suggestive” evidence from small studies that hormones might improve psychological well-being, but **no robust evidence that hormone treatment reduces the elevated risk of suicide** for this population ([www.gov.scot](https://www.gov.scot/publications/cass-review-implications-scotland/pages/4/#:~:text=from%20mainly%20pre,up%20is%20needed)). In other words, while some patients report feeling better on treatment, data do not show a clear reduction in actual suicide rates ([www.gov.scot](https://www.gov.scot/publications/cass-review-implications-scotland/pages/4/#:~:text=The%20evidence%20found%20in%20the,suggestion%20that%20numbers%20are%20increasing)). Likewise, a 2025 comprehensive review by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) – which surveyed worldwide research – determined that the purported benefits of medical transition in minors are supported by “**very weak evidence**,” whereas the potential risks (such as infertility, impaired bone development, and other side effects) are significant ([www.hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/gender-dysphoria-report-release.html#:~:text=The%20review%20highlights%20a%20growing,of%20evidence%20around%20the%20world)). The HHS report’s authors (working under the guidance of the Assistant Secretary for Health) noted that much of the existing research was uncontrolled or low-quality, echoing other countries’ findings that more rigorous studies are needed ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/11/transgender-care-pediatric-transition/#:~:text=The%20HHS%20document%20concurs%20with,growing%20number%20of%20interventions%20at)). The report stated plainly that “the evidence for benefit of pediatric medical transition is very uncertain, while the evidence for harm is less uncertain” ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/01/trump-transition-care-trans-youth-hhs/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20evidence%20for%20benefit%20of,%E2%80%9D)). On that basis, it urged healthcare providers to exercise caution about affirming medical interventions when high-quality evidence of long-term safety and effectiveness is lacking ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/01/trump-transition-care-trans-youth-hhs/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20evidence%20for%20benefit%20of,%E2%80%9D)). This skeptical view aligns with the decisions of several European health authorities (e.g. in Sweden, Finland, the U.K.) to restrict routine youth gender-affirming treatments and instead prioritize research protocols or psychotherapy in many cases [2].

Adding to the debate, outcomes can differ by the type of intervention and population. Most research on youth focuses on puberty blockers and hormones, since surgical procedures are generally not performed on minors (aside from some older teens). In studies of *adults* and older adolescents who undergo gender-affirming surgery, mental health results have been mixed. A large 2023 analysis in the *Journal of Sexual Medicine* using U.S. hospital data found that **transgender individuals who had gender-affirming surgeries actually had higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation** in the two years after surgery compared to a matched group of transgender individuals who had not undergone surgery ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39996623/#:~:text=Results%3A%20From%20107%20583%20patients%2C,RR)). Notably, in that study, 25.4% of trans women (natal males) who had surgery were diagnosed with depression vs. 11.5% of those without surgery ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39996623/#:~:text=Results%3A%20From%20107%20583%20patients%2C,RR)). This counterintuitive finding does not necessarily mean surgery causes worse mental health – it may be that those with more severe dysphoria or mental health challenges were more likely to seek surgery, or that post-surgical patients still need strong ongoing mental health support. It does, however, reinforce that **medical transition is not an automatic “cure” for psychological distress** in every case. Even in the NEJM youth study mentioned earlier, two participants (out of 315) tragically died by suicide during the 2-year follow-up despite receiving hormones ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36652355/#:~:text=Increases%20in%20appearance%20congruence%20were,suicide%20occurred%20in%202%20participants)). These cases illustrate that while many trans youths feel better after gender-affirming treatment, a subset may continue to struggle and require comprehensive mental health care beyond just gender-focused interventions.

In summary, **there is evidence that gender-affirming care can lower suicidality in transgender youth, but this evidence comes with important caveats**. Multiple studies report that adolescents receiving puberty blockers and hormone therapy tend to experience *improvements* in mood, a decrease in suicidal ideation, and better overall mental health in the short term ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35212746//#:~:text=After%20adjustment%20for%20temporal%20trends,CI%2C%200.41%2C%202.51)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36652355/#:~:text=treatment,suicide%20occurred%20in%202%20participants)). This suggests that for many individuals, aligning their bodies with their gender identity relieves distress and may reduce the urge to self-harm. However, experts caution that these findings are not yet definitive. The research thus far largely shows correlations rather than proven causation, and it has important methodological limitations ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/11/transgender-care-pediatric-transition/#:~:text=research%20is%20inadequate%20to%20validate,significantly%20from%20the%20studied%20protocol)). Major medical reviews (in the UK, Sweden, and now the US) have all concluded that **robust evidence proving that gender-affirming medical treatments reduce youth suicide risk is lacking** ([www.gov.scot](https://www.gov.scot/publications/cass-review-implications-scotland/pages/4/#:~:text=The%20evidence%20found%20in%20the,suggestion%20that%20numbers%20are%20increasing)) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/11/transgender-care-pediatric-transition/#:~:text=The%20HHS%20document%20concurs%20with,Instead)). In practice, this means we should be careful about making sweeping promises; while gender-affirming care *can* be life-improving or even life-saving for some youth, it is not a guaranteed or standalone solution for suicide prevention in this vulnerable group. Ensuring the well-being of transgender youth likely requires a holistic approach – not only access to gender-affirming treatments when appropriate, but also strong mental health support, family acceptance, and interventions to address bullying and stigma. As the Washington Post’s editorial board noted, what’s needed going forward is **better-quality research** to guide care: rigorous, long-term studies that can clarify which interventions help most, for whom, and how to maximize benefits while minimizing risks ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/11/transgender-care-pediatric-transition/#:~:text=Clocking%20in%20at%20more%20than,policymakers%20need%20to%20wrestle%20with)) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/11/transgender-care-pediatric-transition/#:~:text=The%20HHS%20document%20concurs%20with,that%20were%20neither%20randomized%20nor)). Until then, the relationship between gender-affirming care and youth suicide risk will continue to be discussed with appropriate nuance. Existing evidence indicates meaningful mental health improvements for many treated youth [3], but definitive proof of reduced suicide mortality remains elusive – calling for both optimism about supportive care and honesty about the limits of our current knowledge [4].

Turban’s study supports the view that timely gender-affirming medical care may reduce suicidality in trans adolescents.

2. **Jesse Singal, 2023 – *Singal-Minded Substack***: *“Researchers Found Puberty Blockers and Hormones Didn’t Improve Trans Kids’ Mental Health… Then They Published a Study Claiming the Opposite.”* – *Viewpoint:* Highly skeptical. Singal critiques a 2022 study, arguing the data showed **no significant improvement** in trans youths’ depression or suicidality after puberty blockers/hormones, despite the original authors’ positive claims[ ([feministlegal.org](https://feministlegal.org/researchers-found-puberty-blockers-and-hormones-didnt-improve-trans-kids-mental-health-at-their-clinic-then-they-published-a-study-claiming-the-opposite-updated/#:~:text=,of%20the%20authors%2C%20is%20false))](https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/researchers-found-puberty-blockers). He suggests that evidence for mental health benefits was overstated and calls for more honest interpretation of results.

3. **Hilary Cass et al., 2022 – *Independent Review of Gender Identity Services (UK NHS)***: *Interim Report (Cass Review).* – *Viewpoint:* Cautious/critical. This official review found the evidence for pediatric gender-transition treatments to be **inadequate**. It noted a lack of reliable data that these interventions reduce suicide or improve long-term outcomes, and recommended limiting puberty blockers to research settings ([www.gov.scot](https://www.gov.scot/publications/cass-review-implications-scotland/pages/4/#:~:text=The%20evidence%20found%20in%20the,suggestion%20that%20numbers%20are%20increasing)). Cass emphasized that no firm conclusion could be drawn that hormone therapy lowers suicide risk in youth, highlighting the need for better research before expanding treatment access.

4. **HHS (Office of Population Affairs), 2025 – *“Treatment for Pediatric Gender Dysphoria: Review of Evidence and Best Practices.”*** – *Viewpoint:* Very cautious. This 409-page U.S. federal report, released under the Biden administration, reviewed global evidence and found **“very weak” evidence of benefit** from youth gender-affirming medical interventions, contrasted with substantial potential risks ([www.hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/gender-dysphoria-report-release.html#:~:text=The%20review%20highlights%20a%20growing,of%20evidence%20around%20the%20world)). The anonymous authors (a panel of medical experts) concluded current research does not conclusively show that puberty blockers or hormones reduce suicidality, aligning with other systematic reviews in calling for more rigorous studies. (See also the *Washington Post* coverage noting the report’s skeptical stance ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/11/transgender-care-pediatric-transition/#:~:text=The%20HHS%20document%20concurs%20with,Instead)).)

5. **Nik-Ahd et al., 2023 – *Journal of Sexual Medicine***: *“Examining Gender-Specific Mental Health Risks After Gender-Affirming Surgery: A National Database Study.”* – *Finding:* Neutral/complex. An analysis of medical records for trans adults (age ≥18) found that those who underwent gender-affirming surgeries had **higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation** in the two years post-surgery than similar trans individuals who hadn’t undergone surgery ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39996623/#:~:text=Results%3A%20From%20107%20583%20patients%2C,RR)). The authors suggest careful interpretation – the results may reflect pre-existing mental health disparities or unmet post-surgical support needs. This study underscores that surgery is not a guaranteed fix for mental health issues and that some trans individuals continue to face elevated suicide risk even after medical transition.

6. **Tordoff et al., 2022 – *JAMA Network Open***: *“Mental Health Outcomes in Transgender and Nonbinary Youths Receiving Gender-Affirming Care.”* – *Finding:* Supportive. A one-year prospective study at a U.S. gender clinic showed that adolescents who started puberty blockers or hormones had **significant improvements** in mental health. The proportion with moderate-to-severe depression and with recent suicidal thoughts dropped over 12 months, and youths who received treatment had 60% lower odds of depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality compared to those who did not ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35212746//#:~:text=After%20adjustment%20for%20temporal%20trends,CI%2C%200.41%2C%202.51)). This suggests gender-affirming hormones are associated with reduced depression and suicidal ideation in the short term. (Notably, the study was observational and about one-third of participants did not start treatment, partly due to delays or personal choice.)

7. **Chen et al., 2023 – *New England Journal of Medicine***: *“Psychosocial Functioning in Transgender Youth after 2 Years of Hormones.”* – *Finding:* Supportive. This NIH-funded study followed 315 transgender and nonbinary youths over two years of hormone therapy. It found **improved psychosocial outcomes** on average – as hormonal treatment progressed, participants reported greater life satisfaction and a decline in depression and anxiety symptoms ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36652355/#:~:text=treatment,suicide%20occurred%20in%202%20participants)). Higher “appearance congruence” (feeling that one’s body matches one’s gender) was linked to better mental health. However, the study also documented that 3.5% of participants experienced suicidal ideation during the study and tragically 2 youths died by suicide ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36652355/#:~:text=Increases%20in%20appearance%20congruence%20were,suicide%20occurred%20in%202%20participants)), indicating that while overall trends were positive, serious risks remained for some individuals. The authors conclude that hormone therapy benefitted most youths’ well-being, while urging continued monitoring of risks.

8. **Fenit Nirappil, 2025 – *The Washington Post (News & Opinion)***: Coverage of the HHS report and editorial response. – *Viewpoint:* Moderated/needs more evidence. *WaPo*’s reporting noted that the HHS review sharply criticized the evidence base for youth gender-affirming care, finding it lacking and highlighting known risks ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/01/trump-transition-care-trans-youth-hhs/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20evidence%20for%20benefit%20of,%E2%80%9D)). An accompanying editorial argued that hyperbolic political language on this issue is unhelpful, and instead “better evidence and reasoned discussion” are needed ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/11/transgender-care-pediatric-transition/#:~:text=This%20hyperbole%20is%20not%20helpful,children%20who%20experience%20gender%20dysphoria)). The editorial board acknowledged the HHS report made a “legitimate case for caution” and concurred with its finding (and the Cass Review’s) that current research is inadequate to prove that these interventions reliably prevent suicide in trans youth ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/11/transgender-care-pediatric-transition/#:~:text=The%20HHS%20document%20concurs%20with,that%20were%20neither%20randomized%20nor)). *Bottom line:* The Washington Post calls for more rigorous studies to guide policy, rather than banning care outright or uncritically affirming it, given the high stakes for young people’s lives.
