# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

Transgender and non-binary adolescents experience far higher rates of suicidal ideation and behavior than their cisgender peers.  A central claim made for gender-affirming medical care (puberty blockers and/or gender-affirming hormones) is that it lowers this risk.  The research base, however, is mixed and methodologically limited, so the answer depends on whether one looks only at associations or also at the certainty of the evidence.

1. Findings that suggest a reduction in suicidality

• Puberty blockers (PB).  In a U.S. survey of 20- to 36-year-olds who had wanted PB in adolescence, those who actually received them had markedly lower lifetime suicidal ideation than those who did not (adjusted OR 0.3) [1].

• Prospective clinic cohort.  In a 12-month follow-up of 104 youths (13-20 y) starting PB and/or hormones, the odds of suicidal thoughts decreased by 73 % after adjusting for baseline mental-health burden (aOR 0.27) [6].

• Two-year hormone cohort.  A larger multicenter study (n = 315) found significant improvements in depression and anxiety after 24 months of hormones; the proportion reporting serious suicidal ideation fell from 3.5 % to 2.3 %, but the change did not reach statistical significance [7].

These studies are consistently in the same direction (fewer suicidal thoughts after treatment), but they are all observational, use convenience samples, and have short time horizons.

2. Findings and reviews highlighting uncertainty or no clear benefit

• A re-analysis of the same clinic data cited above showed no statistically significant change in suicidality once missing data and loss to follow-up were handled differently, illustrating how fragile the results can be [2].

• The Cass Review, an independent evidence assessment for England’s National Health Service, concluded that “the strength of evidence for improved mental-health outcomes, including suicide prevention, is very low; most studies are uncontrolled and at serious risk of bias” [3].

• The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ 2022 systematic review likewise rated the evidence for an effect of PB or hormones on suicidal behavior in adolescents as “very low certainty,” citing inconsistent findings, confounding and short follow-up [4].

3. Limitations common to the literature

• No randomized trials (ethical and practical barriers).  
• Small samples and high attrition.  
• Short follow-up relative to the many-year course of adolescence.  
• Participants who obtain treatment often have more supportive families and better baseline mental health than those who do not, creating positive selection bias.  
• Suicidal behavior is multi-factorial; attributing changes solely to medical treatment is difficult.

4. Overall synthesis

• Association: Most individual cohort and cross-sectional studies report that youth who receive puberty blockers and/or hormones have lower odds of suicidal thoughts or attempts in the first 6–24 months after initiation.

• Causation and certainty: Because all available studies are observational and vulnerable to important biases, major independent reviews rate the certainty of a suicide-preventive effect as low or very low.

• Long-term outcomes: Little is known about suicidality five, ten or more years after starting gender-affirming medical care in adolescence.

Therefore, the best current reading is:

Gender-affirming medical care for minors is associated with decreased suicidal ideation in several short-term observational studies, but the evidence is of low quality, and it is still uncertain whether the care itself causally lowers suicide risk, especially in the long run.  More rigorous, long-term research is needed to resolve this critical question.
