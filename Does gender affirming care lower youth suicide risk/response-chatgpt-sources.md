# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

Does gender-affirming medical care (puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and related interventions) lower the risk of suicide among transgender youth?  The answer is uncertain.  Findings differ by study design and quality:

1. Evidence suggesting a benefit  
   •  A cross-sectional analysis of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (n≈ 20,000) reported that youth who had wanted puberty suppression and actually received it had markedly lower odds of past-year suicidal ideation than those who wanted it but did not receive it (adjusted odds ratio ≈ 0.3) [1].  The authors concluded that “access to pubertal suppression was associated with lower odds of suicidal ideation.”

   Limitations: The survey was retrospective, non-random, and could not rule out selection bias or establish causality (e.g., youths who received care may have had more supportive families, better mental-health care, etc.)—points acknowledged by the authors and by subsequent reviews [3], [4].

2. Evidence finding no clear improvement  
   •  A prospective study of patients at Seattle Children’s Hospital tracked depression, anxiety and suicidality after starting puberty blockers or hormones.  The raw data showed “no improvements” in suicidality or overall mental health over a one-year period, although the published article emphasized subgroup analyses that portrayed the results more favorably; an independent re-analysis argued the study does not demonstrate a suicide-prevention effect [2].

3. Independent systematic reviews  
   •  The Cass Review, commissioned by England’s National Health Service, examined all published pediatric studies and concluded that the evidence for mental-health benefit—including suicide prevention—is “weak,” “low quality,” and unable to demonstrate causation.  It therefore called for controlled, prospective research before firm claims can be made [3].  

   •  A 2022 evidence review prepared for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reached a similar conclusion: studies are “very low” to “low” certainty, often lack control groups, and do not allow confident statements about reductions in suicide or self-harm after gender-affirming treatment [4].

4. Evidence in older populations  
   •  A large U.S. database study of adults found mixed, sex-specific patterns of suicidal behavior after gender-affirming surgeries; these results do not directly answer the pediatric question but reinforce that outcomes are complex and may vary by treatment type and demographic group [5].

Overall assessment  

• One well-publicized cross-sectional survey reports an association between puberty suppression and lower suicidal ideation, but its design cannot prove that the treatment itself caused the difference.  

• At least one prospective clinic study and two comprehensive reviews find the current evidence too weak or inconsistent to conclude that gender-affirming care lowers youth suicide risk.  

• No high-quality randomized or well-controlled longitudinal studies yet demonstrate a clear, causal suicide-prevention effect.

Therefore, while some data are consistent with a protective effect, the best available assessments classify that evidence as low quality and insufficient for firm conclusions.  Larger, controlled, prospective studies are needed to determine whether gender-affirming interventions actually reduce suicide risk in transgender adolescents.
