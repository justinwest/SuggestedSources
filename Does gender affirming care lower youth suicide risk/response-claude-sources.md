# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

The relationship between gender-affirming care and youth suicide risk remains a subject of ongoing scientific debate, with studies showing mixed results and significant methodological limitations.

## Evidence Supporting Reduced Suicide Risk

Several studies suggest that gender-affirming care may reduce suicidal ideation and improve mental health outcomes in transgender youth. A study published in *Pediatrics* found that access to pubertal suppression during adolescence was associated with lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation among transgender adults [1]. Research published in *JAMA Network Open* reported that transgender and nonbinary youth receiving gender-affirming care showed decreased depression, anxiety, and suicidality over time [6].

Additionally, a study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* following transgender youth for two years after starting hormone therapy found improvements in psychosocial functioning and reduced anxiety and depression [7]. These findings suggest potential mental health benefits from gender-affirming interventions.

## Contradictory Evidence and Methodological Concerns

However, other research has challenged these conclusions. A critical analysis revealed that researchers at one clinic found that puberty blockers and hormones did not improve transgender youth's mental health outcomes, yet published findings that suggested the opposite [2]. This raises questions about publication bias and selective reporting in the field.

The Cass Review, an independent examination of gender identity services for children and young people commissioned by NHS England, highlighted the poor quality of evidence supporting gender-affirming treatments for minors [3]. The review noted that most studies lack proper control groups, have short follow-up periods, and suffer from high dropout rates, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about treatment efficacy.

## Official Reviews and Regulatory Positions

A comprehensive review by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services examined the evidence for pediatric gender dysphoria treatments and noted significant limitations in the existing research base [4]. The review emphasized the need for more rigorous, long-term studies to establish the safety and efficacy of these interventions.

Some research has also identified potential risks. A national database study published in *The Journal of Sexual Medicine* found increased mental health risks in certain populations after gender-affirming surgery, though this study focused on surgical rather than medical interventions and included adults [5].

## Current State of Evidence

The scientific literature presents a complex picture. While some studies suggest mental health benefits from gender-affirming care, the evidence base suffers from significant methodological limitations including small sample sizes, lack of control groups, short follow-up periods, and potential selection bias. The field would benefit from larger, longer-term randomized controlled trials to provide more definitive answers about the relationship between gender-affirming care and suicide risk in youth.

Healthcare providers and families must weigh the available evidence alongside individual circumstances, as the research does not yet provide clear, unambiguous guidance on this critical question affecting transgender youth.
