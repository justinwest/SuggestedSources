# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

The relationship between gender-affirming care and youth suicide risk is complex and remains an area of ongoing research and debate. Current evidence presents mixed findings, with studies showing both potential benefits and limitations in demonstrating clear causal relationships.

## Evidence Supporting Reduced Suicide Risk

Several studies suggest that gender-affirming care may reduce suicidal ideation and improve mental health outcomes in transgender youth. A 2020 study in *Pediatrics* found that access to pubertal suppression during adolescence was associated with lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation among transgender adults [1]. The research examined 20,619 transgender adults and found those who had wanted but not received pubertal suppression had higher rates of suicidal thoughts.

A 2022 study published in *JAMA Network Open* followed 104 transgender and nonbinary youth receiving gender-affirming care and found significant decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as reduced suicidality over a 12-month period [6]. Similarly, research published in the *New England Journal of Medicine* in 2023 tracked transgender youth for two years after beginning hormone therapy and found improvements in overall psychosocial functioning [7].

## Limitations and Contradictory Evidence

However, the evidence base faces significant methodological challenges. The Cass Review, an independent analysis commissioned by NHS England, noted that existing studies often lack adequate control groups and long-term follow-up data, making it difficult to establish causation rather than correlation [3]. The review emphasized that the quality of evidence supporting gender-affirming treatments remains low to very low.

Investigative reporting has also raised questions about data interpretation. Analysis of research practices has suggested that some studies may have initially found no significant mental health improvements but later published results emphasizing positive outcomes [2]. This highlights concerns about potential bias in how research findings are presented and interpreted.

A 2025 review by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services examined the existing evidence base and concluded that while some studies suggest benefits, the overall quality of evidence remains insufficient to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of gender-affirming treatments in reducing suicide risk [4].

## Adult Outcomes and Long-term Considerations

Research on adults who have undergone gender-affirming surgery presents additional complexity. A 2025 study examining national database records found that while gender-affirming surgery was associated with some mental health improvements, suicide risk remained elevated compared to the general population, particularly among transgender women [5].

## Current State of Evidence

The current evidence suggests that gender-affirming care may provide mental health benefits for some transgender youth, potentially including reduced suicide risk. However, the research faces significant methodological limitations, including small sample sizes, lack of randomized controlled trials, short follow-up periods, and difficulty accounting for confounding variables.

Many professional medical organizations continue to support gender-affirming care as potentially beneficial, while acknowledging the need for more robust research. The debate continues as researchers work to develop better study designs and gather longer-term outcome data.
