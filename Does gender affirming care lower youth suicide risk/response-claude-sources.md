# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

The relationship between gender-affirming care and youth suicide risk shows mixed evidence, with some studies suggesting benefits while others raise questions about the quality and interpretation of research in this area.

## Evidence Supporting Reduced Suicide Risk

Several studies have found associations between gender-affirming care and improved mental health outcomes. A study published in *Pediatrics* found that access to pubertal suppression was associated with lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation among transgender adults who desired such treatment in adolescence [1]. Research published in *JAMA Network Open* examined 104 transgender and nonbinary youth receiving gender-affirming care and found significant decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as suicidality, over a 12-month period [6].

A study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* following transgender youth for two years after starting hormone therapy found improvements in appearance congruence and positive affect, though it noted that depression and anxiety scores remained elevated compared to general population norms [7].

## Concerns About Research Quality and Interpretation

However, significant concerns have been raised about the quality and interpretation of research in this field. The Cass Review, an independent assessment commissioned by NHS England, found that the evidence base for gender-affirming treatments in children and young people is "remarkably weak" and noted that most studies are of poor quality with significant methodological limitations [3].

Investigative reporting has highlighted instances where researchers' internal findings differed from their published conclusions. One analysis documented a case where researchers found that puberty blockers and hormones didn't improve transgender youth's mental health at their clinic, yet published a study that appeared to claim the opposite [2].

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services review noted that while some studies show positive associations, the evidence is limited by small sample sizes, short follow-up periods, and methodological concerns that make it difficult to establish causal relationships [4].

## Complex Long-term Considerations

Research on post-surgical outcomes presents a more complex picture. A study examining national database records found that while gender-affirming surgery was associated with reduced mental health treatment utilization overall, there were concerning increases in specific areas, including a 12.12-fold increase in suicide attempts among those assigned female at birth after surgery [5].

## Current State of Evidence

The evidence regarding gender-affirming care and youth suicide risk remains contested and methodologically limited. While some studies suggest potential benefits, significant concerns exist about study quality, interpretation of results, and long-term outcomes. The field lacks robust randomized controlled trials, and existing observational studies often have important limitations that affect the reliability of their conclusions.
