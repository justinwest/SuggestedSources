# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

The relationship between gender-affirming care and youth suicide risk is complex and remains a subject of ongoing research and debate. The available evidence presents mixed findings, with some studies suggesting benefits while others raise questions about the quality and interpretation of research in this area.

Several studies have reported positive mental health outcomes associated with gender-affirming care. A study published in *Pediatrics* found that access to pubertal suppression during adolescence was associated with lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation among transgender adults [1]. Research published in *JAMA Network Open* followed transgender and nonbinary youth receiving gender-affirming care and found lower depression, anxiety, and suicidality scores over time [6]. Additionally, a study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* reported improvements in psychosocial functioning after two years of hormone therapy in transgender youth [7].

However, significant concerns have been raised about the quality and interpretation of some research in this field. Jesse Singal's investigation revealed that researchers at one clinic found that puberty blockers and hormones did not improve trans youth's mental health in their internal data, yet published findings that suggested the opposite [2]. This highlights potential issues with research methodology and reporting in this area.

The Cass Review, an independent assessment commissioned by NHS England, raised substantial concerns about the evidence base for gender-affirming treatments for youth. The review noted that the quality of evidence for these interventions is generally poor, with most studies being observational rather than randomized controlled trials, and warned against drawing strong conclusions about benefits or harms [3].

A comprehensive review by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services examined the evidence for pediatric gender dysphoria treatments and found that while some studies suggest benefits, the overall quality of evidence remains limited, with significant methodological concerns across much of the research [4].

Research on post-surgical outcomes has also produced concerning findings. A study in *The Journal of Sexual Medicine* examining mental health risks after gender-affirming surgery found increased rates of certain mental health conditions in some populations, though the interpretation of these findings remains debated [5].

The evidence regarding gender-affirming care and youth suicide risk is characterized by significant methodological limitations, including small sample sizes, lack of control groups, short follow-up periods, and potential selection bias. While some studies suggest potential benefits, the overall quality of evidence remains insufficient to draw definitive conclusions about the relationship between gender-affirming care and suicide risk reduction in youth.
