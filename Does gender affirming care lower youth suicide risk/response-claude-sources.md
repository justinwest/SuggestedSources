# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

The relationship between gender-affirming care and youth suicide risk is a complex and actively debated topic in medical literature, with studies showing mixed results and methodological limitations that make definitive conclusions challenging.

## Supporting Evidence

Several studies suggest potential benefits of gender-affirming care for reducing suicide risk in transgender youth. A study published in *Pediatrics* found that access to pubertal suppression during adolescence was associated with lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation among transgender adults who desired this treatment [1]. Research published in *JAMA Network Open* followed transgender and nonbinary youth receiving gender-affirming care and found improvements in depression and positive affect over time [6]. Additionally, a study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* reported improvements in psychosocial functioning after two years of hormone treatment [7].

## Conflicting Findings and Limitations

However, the evidence base faces significant methodological challenges. A critical analysis published in *Singal-Minded* highlighted discrepancies between researchers' findings and their published conclusions, suggesting that some studies may overstate benefits [2]. The Cass Review, an independent assessment commissioned by NHS England, concluded that the evidence base for gender-affirming treatments in children and adolescents is "built on shaky foundations" and noted that most studies are of poor quality with short follow-up periods [3].

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services conducted a comprehensive review and found that while some studies suggest benefits, the overall evidence remains limited by small sample sizes, lack of control groups, and insufficient long-term follow-up [4]. Notably, research examining outcomes after gender-affirming surgery has shown mixed results, with some studies indicating continued elevated mental health risks even after treatment [5].

## Current Understanding

The available evidence suggests that gender-affirming care may provide mental health benefits for some transgender youth, potentially including reduced suicide risk. However, the quality of existing research makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the magnitude of these effects or which specific interventions are most beneficial. Most studies are observational rather than randomized controlled trials, making it challenging to establish causality.

The scientific consensus appears to be that while gender-affirming care shows promise, more rigorous research with longer follow-up periods is needed to fully understand its impact on suicide risk and other mental health outcomes in transgender youth.
