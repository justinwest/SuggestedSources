# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

Based on the provided sources, the evidence regarding whether gender affirming care lowers youth suicide risk is mixed and contested, with significant methodological concerns raised about existing research.

## Supporting Evidence

The American Academy of Pediatrics published research suggesting that pubertal suppression may reduce suicidal ideation among transgender youth [1]. However, this finding has been subject to methodological scrutiny and reanalysis.

## Concerns and Contradictory Findings

Significant questions have been raised about the reliability of research in this area. One analysis revealed that researchers at a major clinic found that puberty blockers and hormones did not improve transgender youth's mental health outcomes, yet subsequently published findings that suggested the opposite conclusion [2]. This raises serious concerns about research integrity and potential bias in the published literature.

The Cass Review, an independent systematic review commissioned by NHS England, found substantial gaps in the evidence base for gender-affirming treatments for young people [3]. The review highlighted concerns about the quality of existing studies and noted insufficient evidence to support many current treatment approaches.

## Broader Mental Health Outcomes

Research examining post-treatment outcomes has found concerning patterns. A national database study revealed increased mental health risks, including elevated rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidality, following gender-affirming surgical procedures [5]. While this study focused on surgical rather than non-surgical interventions, it suggests that gender-affirming treatments may not consistently improve mental health outcomes.

## Current State of Evidence

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has conducted reviews of the evidence base for pediatric gender dysphoria treatments, though the specific conclusions are not detailed in the available abstract [4]. The overall picture suggests that while some studies report benefits, there are significant methodological limitations and contradictory findings that make definitive conclusions difficult.

**Conclusion**: The current evidence does not provide clear, reliable support for the claim that gender affirming care consistently lowers youth suicide risk. Significant methodological concerns, contradictory findings, and evidence gaps suggest that more rigorous research is needed to establish definitive conclusions about these interventions' effects on suicidal ideation and mental health outcomes in transgender youth.
