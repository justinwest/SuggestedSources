# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

The question of whether gender-affirming care lowers suicide risk for youth is a subject of significant debate, with conflicting findings across different studies and reviews. While some studies show a correlation between accessing medical interventions and reduced suicidal ideation, major systematic reviews and critiques highlight weaknesses in the evidence, concluding that a causal link has not been reliably established [3, 4].

Several studies have found an association between gender-affirming care and improved mental health outcomes. A 2020 study in *Pediatrics* analyzed survey data from transgender individuals aged 13-24 and found that those who had access to puberty blockers reported lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to those who wanted them but could not get them [1]. Another study published in *JAMA Network Open* in 2022 followed 104 transgender and nonbinary youths aged 13-20 for 12 months. It found that receiving gender-affirming medical care, including puberty blockers and hormones, was associated with 60% lower odds of moderate to severe depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality [6]. Similarly, a 2023 study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* tracked transgender youth for two years after starting hormones and found improvements in life satisfaction and a decrease in depression and anxiety scores, although their mental health indicators remained more concerning than those of their cisgender peers [7].

However, other comprehensive reviews and analyses have raised serious concerns about the quality and certainty of this evidence. The interim report of the Cass Review, an independent review commissioned by NHS England, concluded that the evidence base for gender-affirming care in youth is "remarkably weak" and that the existing studies are not sufficient to determine whether puberty blockers or hormones reduce suicide risk [3]. The review noted that studies are often small, lack control groups, and suffer from high rates of patients being lost to follow-up, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. It also pointed out that while some studies show improved mental health, others do not, and no single study provides a robust basis for clinical decisions [3].

This conclusion is echoed in an internal review conducted for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which was not publicly released but later reported on [4, 8]. This review systematically assessed the available literature and determined that the evidence for the benefits of hormonal treatment for adolescents was of "low quality" and that claims of reduced suicidality were not supported by the existing data. The review criticized studies for confounding variables and a lack of long-term follow-up [4].

Critiques have also been leveled at specific studies in the field. One analysis published in *Singal-Minded* examined the 2022 *JAMA Network Open* study and argued that the researchers' published conclusion—that care improved mental health—was not supported by their own data, which the critic claimed showed no statistically significant change in depression or suicidality when analyzed differently [2].

Further complicating the picture, research into outcomes after gender-affirming surgery (typically for adults) also presents mixed results. A 2024 study in *The Journal of Sexual Medicine* analyzed a national database in Denmark and found that while the need for mental health treatment for anxiety and depression decreased for transgender women after surgery, the risk for suicide attempts remained elevated compared to the general population [5]. This suggests that medical transition does not eliminate underlying mental health vulnerabilities.

In summary, while some observational studies suggest that gender-affirming care may be associated with a lower risk of suicide for youth, major systematic reviews from health authorities like NHS England and an internal HHS team have found the evidence to be of low quality and inconclusive [3, 4]. The debate is characterized by studies with significant methodological limitations and conflicting interpretations of the available data.
