# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

The question of whether gender-affirming care lowers suicide risk among youth is a subject of ongoing scientific and public debate. While some observational studies report a correlation between receiving care and improved mental health outcomes, including lower suicidality, major systematic reviews and other analyses point to significant methodological weaknesses in the evidence, making it difficult to establish a clear causal link.

### Evidence Associating Care with Reduced Suicide Risk

Several studies suggest a positive association between gender-affirming care and mental health. A 2022 study in *JAMA Network Open* of 104 transgender and nonbinary youths found that receiving gender-affirming medical interventions, such as puberty blockers and hormones, was associated with 60% lower odds of moderate to severe depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality over a 12-month period [6]. Similarly, a 2020 study in *Pediatrics* found that transgender youth who desired and received pubertal suppression had significantly lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to those who desired it but did not receive it [1]. Another study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* followed transgender youth for two years after starting hormone treatment and found that their appearance congruence improved, and scores for depression and anxiety decreased while life satisfaction scores increased [7].

### Evidence Highlighting Uncertainty and Weak Methodology

Despite these findings, multiple systematic reviews and critiques have concluded that the overall quality of evidence is low and insufficient to confirm that gender-affirming care causes a reduction in suicide risk.

The independent Cass Review, commissioned by NHS England, conducted a systematic review of evidence and concluded in its interim report that the research in this field is of "low quality" [3]. The review noted that studies are often small, lack control groups, and do not follow up with participants long-term, making it impossible to determine if positive changes in mental health are a direct result of the medical treatment or other factors like supportive clinical care [3].

An anonymously authored review, circulated within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) but not officially published by the agency, reached a similar conclusion [4, 8]. It assessed the available international studies and determined that the evidence was of low certainty and insufficient to support the claim that medical interventions for gender dysphoria reduce the risk of suicide [4].

Critiques of individual studies also highlight methodological issues. For instance, an article in *Singal-Minded* analyzes the study published in *JAMA Network Open* [6] and argues that its conclusions are not fully supported by its own data. The critique points out that the study lacked a control group and that improvements in depression and anxiety were not statistically significant when measured against the study's baseline, raising questions about whether the care itself was the driver of the reported positive outcomes [2].

### Nuances in Different Types of Care

The effects of different types of gender-affirming care may also vary. A 2024 study in *The Journal of Sexual Medicine* examined the impact of gender-affirming surgery on adults. It found that while transgender men who underwent surgery had a temporary decrease in the need for mental health treatment, this effect did not last. More notably, the study found that transgender women had a significantly *increased* risk of suicide attempts in the years following surgery compared to transgender women who had not undergone surgery [5]. This suggests that the relationship between medical interventions and mental health outcomes is complex and not uniformly positive across all types of care or populations.

In conclusion, while some studies show a correlation between receiving gender-affirming care and lower rates of suicidality among youth, this finding is contested. Major systematic reviews from sources like the Cass Review and critical analyses have identified significant limitations in the existing research, including a lack of control groups, confounding variables, and poor-quality evidence. They conclude that it is not currently possible to establish a definitive causal link between gender-affirming care and a reduction in suicide risk.
