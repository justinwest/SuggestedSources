# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

The question of whether gender-affirming care lowers suicide risk for youth is a subject of significant debate, with different studies and reviews reaching varied conclusions. While some observational studies report a positive correlation between receiving care and improved mental health outcomes, major systematic reviews and critiques point to a lack of high-quality evidence and methodological weaknesses in the existing research.

### Evidence Suggesting a Reduced Risk

Several studies suggest an association between gender-affirming care and a lower risk of suicide or suicidal ideation.

*   A 2020 study in *Pediatrics* surveyed transgender adults and found that those who had access to puberty blockers during adolescence when they desired them had lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to those who wanted them but could not access them [1].
*   A 2022 study in *JAMA Network Open* followed a cohort of 104 transgender and nonbinary youths aged 13-20. The study reported that after 12 months, the receipt of puberty blockers and gender-affirming hormones was associated with a 60% decrease in depression and a 73% decrease in suicidality [6].
*   A 2023 study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* followed 315 transgender youth in the Netherlands. It found that after two years of receiving hormones, participants' mental health and psychosocial functioning improved, with a decrease in suicidal thoughts. Life satisfaction and body image also improved, while depression and anxiety remained stable [7].

### Criticisms and Calls for Caution

Conversely, other analyses and systematic reviews highlight significant weaknesses in the evidence base, arguing that the link between gender-affirming care and reduced suicide risk is not well-established.

*   The **Cass Review**, an independent review commissioned by NHS England, concluded in its interim report that the evidence for medical interventions in youth is of "very low" quality. The review noted that existing studies are often small, lack control groups, and have high rates of patients dropping out, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the long-term benefits or harms of treatments like puberty blockers and hormones [3]. The final Cass Review, published in 2024, reinforced these findings, calling for a more cautious approach and emphasizing the need for higher-quality research.
*   The **U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)** was associated with an internal review, posted online by an anonymous author, that analyzed the evidence base for pediatric gender-affirming care [4, 8]. This review concluded that the available studies are of low quality and that a "causal link between hormonal interventions and improved mental health outcomes cannot be established" from the existing data. It pointed to issues like confounding variables and a lack of long-term follow-up [4].
*   Journalist Jesse Singal, in a detailed critique of the 2022 *JAMA Network Open* study, argued that the study's authors misrepresented their own findings. Singal noted that while the study's abstract claimed significant mental health improvements, the data within the study showed no statistically significant change on its two primary outcome measures for depression and anxiety. The reported improvements in suicidality were from a secondary, single-question measure [2].
*   A 2024 study in *The Journal of Sexual Medicine* examined mental health outcomes after gender-affirming surgery in a large national database (not exclusively youth). It found that while overall suicide risk was not higher than in the general population after an adjustment period, there was an increased risk of suicide attempts for certain subgroups, particularly those with pre-existing psychiatric conditions [5]. This suggests that outcomes are not uniformly positive and depend on individual patient factors.

In summary, while some studies show a correlation between gender-affirming care and reduced suicide risk in youth, this finding is contested. Major systematic reviews from health bodies like the NHS and critical analyses of the research highlight a lack of robust, high-quality evidence, preventing a definitive conclusion. The field largely agrees on the need for more rigorous, long-term studies to better understand the effects of these interventions.
