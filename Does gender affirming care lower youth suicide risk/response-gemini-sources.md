# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

Based on the provided sources, there is significant debate and conflicting evidence regarding whether gender-affirming care lowers suicide risk in youth. While some observational studies suggest a positive correlation between access to medical interventions and reduced suicidal ideation, major systematic reviews and other large-scale studies highlight serious methodological flaws in that research and have not found evidence of a reduced suicide risk.

Several U.S.-based studies report an association between gender-affirming care and improved mental health outcomes.
*   A 2022 study in *JAMA Network Open* followed 104 transgender and nonbinary youths aged 13-20. It found that receiving gender-affirming medical care, such as puberty blockers or hormones, was associated with 60% lower odds of moderate to severe depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality over a 12-month period [6].
*   A 2020 study in *Pediatrics* surveyed 20,619 transgender adults and found that those who had access to puberty blockers during adolescence reported lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to those who wanted them but could not get them [1].
*   A 2023 study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* followed 315 transgender and nonbinary youths for two years after they started hormones. It found that while participants' scores for depression and anxiety decreased, they remained higher than those of the general youth population. The study concluded that gender-affirming hormones were linked to improved appearance congruence and psychosocial functioning [7].

However, other comprehensive reviews and critical analyses raise significant questions about the quality and certainty of this evidence.
*   The independent Cass Review, commissioned by England's National Health Service (NHS), conducted a systematic review of evidence for puberty blockers and hormones. Its interim report concluded that the evidence base is of "poor quality," making it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the risks and benefits of these interventions. The review noted a lack of reliable long-term studies, small sample sizes, and failure to account for other mental health conditions or therapeutic support [3].
*   A critique by journalist Jesse Singal analyzes the study that formed the basis of the 2022 *JAMA Network Open* paper. Singal argues that the clinic's own internal data showed no statistically significant improvement in key mental health metrics for youths receiving puberty blockers and hormones. He contends that the positive published findings were the result of post-hoc statistical methods that may not accurately reflect the initial results [2].
*   A leaked internal review document, reportedly from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), reviewed existing studies and concluded that they were of "low quality" and did not provide "conclusive evidence" that medical interventions for gender dysphoria reduce the risk of suicide [4, 8]. The report cited issues like a lack of control groups, confounding variables, and short follow-up periods [4]. The authorship and official status of this document are contested [8].
*   A 2025 national database study published in *The Journal of Sexual Medicine* examined over 37,000 individuals, including those who had undergone gender-affirming surgery. It found that while transgender individuals had higher baseline risks for mental health conditions, gender-affirming surgery was not associated with a reduced risk of post-operative suicide attempts. The study did find an increased risk for anxiety and PTSD post-surgery for transgender men [5].

In summary, while some studies show a correlation between gender-affirming care and lower rates of reported suicidality, this finding is not consistently supported across all research. Major systematic reviews from health authorities like the NHS in England, along with other critical analyses and large-scale studies, have concluded that the evidence base is too weak and methodologically flawed to determine whether these interventions causally reduce suicide risk [3, 4, 5].
