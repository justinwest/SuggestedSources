# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

Based on the provided sources, the relationship between gender-affirming care and youth suicide risk is complex and debated. Some sources suggest a protective effect, while others highlight a weak evidence base, methodological concerns, and persistent risks.

### Evidence of Reduced Suicide Risk
A study in *Pediatrics* found an association between access to puberty blockers and a lower risk of suicidal ideation. The study surveyed transgender individuals aged 13–21 and reported that among those who desired and received pubertal suppression, the odds of lifetime suicidal ideation were lower compared to those who desired but did not receive them [1]. Similarly, a review document from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) states that gender-affirming care improves the mental health of gender-diverse youth and that a lack of such care is associated with higher rates of mental health issues, including suicidality [4].

### Criticism and Cautions Regarding the Evidence
Other sources express significant caution about the strength of this evidence. The interim report from the Cass Review, commissioned by NHS England, systematically reviewed the available literature and concluded that the evidence base for hormonal interventions for young people is of "very low quality" [3]. The report states that it is not possible to draw firm conclusions about the impact of puberty blockers on mental health and suicidal ideation due to the lack of controlled trials and the presence of confounding factors [3].

This concern over evidence quality is echoed in a critique by Jesse Singal, who argues that some prominent studies claiming mental health benefits from puberty blockers and hormones contain methodological flaws or present conclusions that are not supported by their own data [2].

Furthermore, a national database study published in *The Journal of Sexual Medicine* examined mental health outcomes after gender-affirming surgery. It found that while the overall risk for suicide attempts was significantly elevated for transgender individuals compared to the general population, this risk "did not differ significantly between patients who had undergone gender-affirming surgery and those who had not" [5]. This suggests that even after significant medical intervention, elevated suicide risk may persist and that surgery itself may not be the key determinant in reducing that risk [5].

### Conclusion
In summary, while some research [1] and U.S. governmental guidance [4] support the view that gender-affirming care lowers suicide risk in youth, other high-level reviews [3], critical analyses [2], and long-term studies on surgical interventions [5] point to a very weak evidence base, methodological concerns, and persistently high suicide risks even after medical treatment. The provided sources do not offer a consensus on the question.
