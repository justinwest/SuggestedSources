# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

The relationship between gender-affirming care and youth suicide risk is a subject of significant research and debate. While several studies suggest that this care is associated with a lower risk of suicide, other major reviews and critiques highlight weaknesses in the evidence, leading to a lack of clear scientific consensus [3, 4].

### Evidence Suggesting a Reduced Suicide Risk
Several observational studies report an association between receiving gender-affirming care and improved mental health outcomes, including reduced suicidality.

*   A 2022 study in *JAMA Network Open* followed 104 transgender and nonbinary youths aged 13-20. It found that those who received puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones had 60% lower odds of moderate to severe depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality over a 12-month period compared to those who did not [6].
*   A 2020 study in *Pediatrics* surveyed 20,619 transgender adults aged 18-36 about their adolescent experiences. The study found that individuals who had desired and received puberty blockers had lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to those who desired them but did not receive them [1].
*   A 2022 study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* followed 315 transgender youth in the Netherlands for two years after starting hormones. It found that while psychosocial functioning, happiness, and body image improved, suicidal ideation remained stable and did not significantly decrease from the already high baseline levels [7].

### Critiques and Methodological Concerns
Despite these findings, several systematic reviews and critiques argue that the quality of the available evidence is low and that conclusions about causality cannot be drawn.

*   The **Cass Review**, an independent review commissioned by England's National Health Service (NHS), concluded in its interim report that the evidence base for gender-affirming treatments is "remarkably weak" [3]. The review noted a lack of controlled trials and poor long-term follow-up data, making it difficult to assess the actual impact of medical interventions. It also pointed out that it is unclear whether co-occurring mental health issues are the cause of, or are caused by, gender distress [3].
*   A 2024 review, reportedly from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), similarly concluded that the studies supporting pediatric gender-affirming care are of "low quality" and suffer from major methodological flaws [4, 8]. The review argues that positive outcomes may be due to other factors, such as accompanying therapeutic support, rather than the medical interventions themselves. It also notes a lack of long-term data on suicide risk into adulthood [4].
*   Journalist Jesse Singal critiqued the 2022 *JAMA Network Open* study, arguing that the researchers' initial analysis found no statistically significant mental health improvement. He states that the published, positive findings were achieved only after changing the statistical model, a practice he questions. This critique highlights concerns about how study results are analyzed and presented [2].

### Long-Term Outcomes
Research into the long-term effects of gender-affirming care, particularly surgery, on mental health is also mixed. A 2024 study in *The Journal of Sexual Medicine* examined a national database of adults who underwent gender-affirming surgery. It found that while most groups did not see an increase in post-operative mental health treatment, transmasculine individuals (female-to-male) who underwent a hysterectomy had an increased rate of subsequent outpatient mental health visits. This suggests that the relationship between medical interventions and long-term mental health is complex and not universally positive [5].

In summary, while some observational studies correlate gender-affirming care with lower rates of suicidality in youth, major systemic reviews from health authorities like the NHS have found the evidence base to be weak and inconclusive [3, 4]. Critics point to methodological flaws in existing studies, such as the inability to separate the effects of medical treatment from those of psychological support and the lack of reliable long-term data [2, 4]. Therefore, it cannot be definitively concluded from the current evidence that gender-affirming care lowers youth suicide risk.
