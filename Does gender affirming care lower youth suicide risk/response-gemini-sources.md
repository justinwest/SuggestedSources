The question of whether gender-affirming care lowers suicide risk among youth is a subject of significant scientific and public debate. While several studies indicate an association between access to care and reduced suicidal ideation, major systematic reviews and other analyses highlight weaknesses in the evidence and call for more robust research.

### Evidence Suggesting Reduced Suicide Risk

Several observational studies have found a correlation between gender-affirming care and improved mental health outcomes, including reduced suicidality.

*   A 2022 study in *JAMA Network Open* followed 104 transgender and nonbinary youths (ages 13-20) for 12 months. It found that receiving gender-affirming medical interventions, such as puberty blockers and hormones, was associated with 60% lower odds of moderate to severe depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality [6].
*   A 2020 study in *Pediatrics* analyzed data from a large cross-sectional survey of transgender adults. It found that those who had received puberty blockers during adolescence had lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to those who desired but did not receive them [1].
*   A 2023 prospective study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* followed 315 transgender youth in the Netherlands for two years after starting hormone treatment. While its primary focus was not suicide, it found that after two years, participants' scores for depression and anxiety had not changed significantly, but their life satisfaction had improved and their gender dysphoria had lessened [7].

### Critiques of the Evidence and Calls for Caution

Despite these findings, several comprehensive reviews and critiques argue that the quality of the existing evidence is low and insufficient to establish a clear causal link between medical interventions and reduced suicide risk.

*   The **Cass Review**, an independent review commissioned by England's National Health Service (NHS), released an interim report in 2022 that described the evidence base for gender-affirming care in youth as "weak." The report noted a lack of long-term follow-up studies and the absence of randomized controlled trials. It concluded that it is "not possible to be sure" whether the observed positive changes in mental health are due to the medical treatments themselves or to other factors like the psychosocial support that accompanies them [3].
*   An unsigned paper attributed to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which has been criticized as a political document, reviewed existing studies and concluded they were of "low or very low quality" [4, 8]. The paper argued that the studies fail to provide a reliable evidence base to support the claim that medical interventions for gender dysphoria improve mental health outcomes [4]. Critics of this paper, however, point out its anonymous authorship and political context, questioning its objectivity [8, 9].
*   Journalist Jesse Singal published a critique of the 2022 *JAMA Network Open* study, arguing that its published conclusions did not align with the underlying data. Singal contended that the study's own results showed no statistically significant improvement in depression or suicidality when analyzed as intended by the researchers' pre-registered plan, and that the positive findings were the result of post-hoc statistical choices [2].

### Complex and Long-Term Outcomes

The long-term effects of gender-affirming care are still being studied, and some research points to complex outcomes. A 2024 study in *The Journal of Sexual Medicine* examined a national database of adults in Denmark who had undergone gender-affirming surgery. It found that while overall mortality was not higher, the group had a significantly elevated risk for suicide attempts compared to the general population, even years after surgery. The authors caution that this does not imply the surgery caused the increased risk; rather, it may reflect the high burden of psychiatric comorbidity that predates the intervention and persists afterward [5].

The debate is further complicated by the fact that it is not purely scientific but also deeply political and legal. Some, like Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, argue that the uncertainty in the evidence, as highlighted by sources like the Cass Review, justifies legal restrictions on gender-affirming care for minors [9].

In conclusion, while some observational studies suggest that gender-affirming care is associated with a lower risk of suicide for transgender youth, this conclusion is contested. Major systematic reviews have identified significant limitations in the existing research, citing a weak evidence base and a lack of high-quality, long-term data. Therefore, a definitive causal relationship has not been established, and the scientific and medical communities continue to debate the most effective and safe way to support transgender youth.
