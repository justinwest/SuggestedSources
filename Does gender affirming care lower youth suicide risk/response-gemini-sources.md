# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

The question of whether gender-affirming care lowers suicide risk for youth is a subject of significant scientific and public debate. While several studies suggest a positive association between receiving care and improved mental health outcomes, including reduced suicidality, systematic reviews and critiques of the research highlight major limitations in the evidence, making it difficult to establish a clear causal link.

### Studies Suggesting a Link to Reduced Suicide Risk

Several observational studies indicate a correlation between gender-affirming care and a lower risk of suicide or suicidal ideation.

*   A 2022 study in *JAMA Network Open* followed 104 transgender and nonbinary youths aged 13-20. The study found that after 12 months, the youths who received puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones had 60% lower odds of moderate to severe depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality compared to those who did not [6].
*   A 2020 study in *Pediatrics* surveyed over 20,000 transgender adults and found that those who had received puberty blockers during adolescence had lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to those who wanted but could not access them [1].
*   A 2022 study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* followed 315 transgender youth for two years after they started hormones. It reported that participants' scores for appearance congruence and life satisfaction improved, while scores for depression and anxiety, which were high at the start, did not significantly change but also did not worsen [7].

### Critiques of the Evidence and Calls for Caution

Despite these findings, several systematic reviews and critical analyses argue that the quality of the available evidence is too low to draw firm conclusions about causality. They point to methodological flaws in existing studies, such as the lack of control groups, small sample sizes, high rates of participants lost to follow-up, and the inability to distinguish the effects of medical treatments from the effects of accompanying psychosocial support.

*   **The Cass Review:** An independent review commissioned by England's National Health Service (NHS) concluded in its interim report that the evidence base for gender-affirming care for youth is of "poor quality." The review noted a lack of long-term follow-up studies and stated that it is "not possible to be sure about the long-term outcomes" of puberty suppression or hormone treatment. It also observed that for many of the existing studies, it is unclear whether observed improvements are due to the medical intervention itself or to the "psychosocial support that is provided" [3].
*   **Unofficial U.S. HHS Review:** An unofficial, anonymously authored review, reportedly originating from within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, conducted a systematic review of the evidence. It concluded that the studies claiming to show benefits from hormonal treatments for adolescents are "low-quality" and that "no conclusions can be drawn about the effect... on mental health" [4, 8]. The review noted that no randomized controlled trials—the gold standard of medical research—have been conducted on the topic [4].
*   **Critiques of Specific Studies:** The *JAMA Network Open* study has been subject to specific criticism. An analysis published in *Singal-Minded* by Jesse Singal alleged that the study’s authors did not find a statistically significant improvement in their primary mental health metrics but used a different statistical model to arrive at the positive conclusions published in the paper's abstract and promoted in press materials [2].
*   **Outcomes After Surgery in Adults:** Research on older populations undergoing more intensive interventions has also produced mixed results. A 2025 study in *The Journal of Sexual Medicine* analyzed a national U.S. database of adults who underwent gender-affirming surgery. It found "no significant protective effect of [gender-affirming surgery] against any-cause mortality or suicide mortality" and noted an increased risk for suicide attempts post-surgery in the transgender women cohort compared to the general population [5].

### Conclusion

In summary, the available evidence on whether gender-affirming care lowers youth suicide risk is contested and inconclusive. Some observational studies show a correlation between accessing medical interventions like puberty blockers and hormones and lower rates of depression and suicidality. However, systematic reviews and other expert analyses from sources like the Cass Review argue that the research is of low quality and cannot establish causation. These critiques emphasize that the observed benefits may be due to the supportive clinical environment rather than the medical treatments themselves. Therefore, while proponents point to positive associations in some studies, there is not a firm scientific consensus, and major health organizations are increasingly calling for higher-quality, long-term research to better understand the effects of these interventions [3, 10].
