# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

The question of whether gender-affirming care lowers suicide risk among youth is a subject of significant medical and scientific debate. While some observational studies report an association between access to care and reduced suicidal ideation, major systematic reviews and other analyses have described the evidence as weak and inconclusive, pointing to methodological limitations in the research.

**Evidence Suggesting a Reduction in Suicide Risk**

Several studies report that gender-affirming medical interventions are associated with improved mental health outcomes, including reduced suicidality.

*   A 2022 study in *JAMA Network Open* followed 104 transgender and nonbinary youths aged 13-20. It found that after 12 months, the group that received puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones had 60% lower odds of moderate to severe depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality compared to the group that had not [6].
*   A 2020 study in *Pediatrics* analyzed survey data from over 20,000 transgender adults, asking them to recall their adolescent experiences. It found that those who had access to pubertal suppression during adolescence had lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to those who desired but did not receive puberty blockers [1].
*   A 2023 study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* tracked 315 transgender youth for two years after they started hormones. The study found that their appearance congruence and life satisfaction increased, while their depression and anxiety scores remained stable rather than worsening, which some researchers view as a positive outcome in a high-risk population [7].

**Evidence Questioning the Link and Quality of Research**

In contrast, several systematic reviews and critical analyses argue that the evidence supporting a link between gender-affirming care and reduced suicide risk is not robust and that existing studies have significant methodological flaws.

*   The **Cass Review**, an independent review commissioned by England's National Health Service (NHS), conducted a systematic review of evidence for puberty blockers and hormones. It concluded that the research was of "very low quality" and therefore could not provide reliable conclusions about the impact of these treatments on mental health, including suicidality. The review noted that no study had been ableto disentangle the effects of the medical intervention from the effects of the accompanying clinical support and psychological care [3].
*   An internal review document from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), written by an anonymous author and later made public, heavily critiqued the evidence base. Citing European systematic reviews (including the Cass Review), the document states that the evidence for the benefits of hormonal interventions on youth mental health is weak and that the "claim that hormonal interventions prevent suicides is not supported by the evidence" [4, 8].
*   Journalist Jesse Singal critiqued the public presentation of a key U.S. study on puberty blockers and hormones (the same research group that published the *JAMA* and *NEJM* studies). He argued that while the study was framed as showing benefits, the researchers’ own data did not find statistically significant improvements in depression or anxiety over the study period, and that crucial context about methodology and results was often omitted in public summaries [2].
*   A 2024 study in *The Journal of Sexual Medicine* on adults who had undergone gender-affirming surgery in Sweden found a complex outcome. While the need for mental health treatment for depression and anxiety disorders decreased after surgery, the risk for suicide attempts was elevated post-surgery when compared to the general population [5]. While this study is on adults and surgery, it complicates the narrative that medical transition consistently resolves underlying mental health vulnerabilities.

In summary, while some U.S.-based observational studies suggest an association between receiving gender-affirming care and lower rates of suicidality, major systematic reviews from European health authorities have found the evidence base to be weak and unreliable. The core of the debate centers on whether the observed associations are causal or a result of other factors, such as the supportive clinical environment, and whether the methodological limitations of existing studies—such as the lack of control groups and high rates of participants lost to follow-up—allow for firm conclusions to be drawn [3, 4].
