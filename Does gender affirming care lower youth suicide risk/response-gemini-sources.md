Based on the provided sources, there is no scientific consensus on whether gender-affirming care lowers youth suicide risk. Some studies suggest a positive association between receiving care and improved mental health outcomes, including reduced suicidal ideation. However, other sources, including major systematic reviews, argue that the evidence base is weak, methodologically flawed, and insufficient to draw firm conclusions.

### Evidence Suggesting a Reduction in Suicide Risk

Several studies report a correlation between gender-affirming care and lower rates of suicidality.

*   A 2022 study in *JAMA Network Open* followed 104 transgender and nonbinary youths aged 13-20 for one year. The authors found that receiving puberty blockers and gender-affirming hormones was associated with 60% lower odds of moderate to severe depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality [6].
*   A 2020 study in *Pediatrics* analyzed a survey of over 20,000 transgender adults. It found that individuals who had received puberty blockers during adolescence had significantly lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to those who wanted them but could not access them [1].
*   A 2023 study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* tracked transgender youth for two years after starting hormones. It reported improvements in appearance congruence and life satisfaction. However, it also noted that anxiety and depression symptoms did not significantly change and remained higher than in the general population [7].

### Critiques and Evidence Pointing to Uncertainty

Conversely, several sources, including systematic reviews and critiques of existing studies, highlight significant weaknesses in the evidence.

*   The **Cass Review**, an independent review commissioned by England's National Health Service (NHS), conducted a systematic review of evidence. Its interim report concluded that the quality of studies on puberty blockers and hormones is "very low" [3]. The review stated that the "evidence is insufficient" to make recommendations and that it was not possible to determine if the care had a positive or negative effect on mental health, including suicidality, due to a lack of controlled trials and poor-quality data [3, 9].
*   A critique published in *Singal-Minded* by Jesse Singal closely examined the 2022 *JAMA Network Open* study [6]. Singal argues that the study's published conclusion—that care reduced depression and suicidality—is not supported by the data presented within the study itself, which he states showed no statistically significant improvements on its primary mental health metrics over the 12-month period [2].
*   A review authored by U.S. health officials, which became the subject of political debate, systematically evaluated the literature and concluded that the evidence for the benefits of hormonal treatment for adolescents is of "low quality" [4, 8, 9]. The review noted that no controlled trials exist and that existing observational studies suffer from major methodological flaws, such as small sample sizes, short follow-up periods, and a lack of adequate control groups, making it impossible to establish a causal link between treatment and improved mental health outcomes [4].
*   A 2024 study in *The Journal of Sexual Medicine* on the effects of gender-affirming surgery (a different intervention than puberty blockers or hormones for youth) found complex results. It reported that while transgender men had a reduced risk for subsequent mental health encounters compared to the general population, transgender women had an increased risk [5]. This highlights that the impact of different forms of gender-affirming care on mental health is not uniform.

In summary, while some researchers have published findings associating gender-affirming care with reduced suicidal ideation, major systematic evidence reviews from organizations like the NHS have concluded that the underlying studies are of very low quality. These reviews and other critiques assert that due to significant methodological flaws and a lack of reliable data, it is not currently possible to determine whether gender-affirming care reduces suicide risk in youth [2, 3, 4].
