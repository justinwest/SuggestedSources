# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

Based on the provided sources, there is significant debate and no scientific consensus on whether gender-affirming care lowers suicide risk in youth. While some observational studies suggest a correlation between receiving such care and reduced suicidality, systematic reviews and methodological critiques highlight a lack of high-quality evidence and point to major flaws in the research.

Several studies report a positive association between gender-affirming care and mental health outcomes. A 2022 study in *JAMA Network Open* followed transgender and nonbinary youths who received puberty blockers or hormones. It found that over 12 months, the recipients had 60% lower odds of moderate to severe depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality compared to their baseline [6]. Similarly, a 2020 study in *Pediatrics* found that transgender youth who desired and received pubertal suppression had significantly lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to those who desired it but did not receive it [1]. A 2023 study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* on hormonal treatment reported improvements in appearance congruence and life satisfaction after two years, though it did not find statistically significant changes in depression or anxiety scores [7].

However, these findings face significant criticism regarding their methodology and the overall quality of the evidence. The interim report of the Cass Review, an independent review commissioned by NHS England, concluded that the evidence base for gender-affirming care in youth is of "very low quality" [3]. The review noted that existing studies are often observational, lack control groups, and do not adequately account for confounding factors, making it impossible to determine whether positive changes are due to the medical interventions themselves or the associated psychological support. The report expressed caution, stating that a "clinical consensus" had emerged in the absence of a "firm evidence base" [3].

This critique is echoed in other sources. A journalistic analysis by Jesse Singal argues that the authors of the *JAMA Network Open* study initially found no statistically significant improvement in their pre-registered primary outcomes of depression and anxiety. He contends that the published paper highlighted secondary or post-hoc analyses to claim a positive effect on suicidality, a finding that was not part of the original research plan [2].

Furthermore, an unofficial, anonymously authored review of evidence, reportedly from a senior official at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, also concluded that the evidence for the benefits of pediatric gender-affirming care is of low quality [4, 8]. This review points out that no controlled trials—the gold standard of medical research—have been conducted. It suggests that any observed improvements in mental health could be attributable to the comprehensive therapeutic support that often accompanies medical interventions, rather than the interventions themselves [4].

Finally, research on long-term outcomes after surgical interventions complicates the narrative. A 2024 study in *The Journal of Sexual Medicine* using a national Swedish database found that while gender-affirming surgery was associated with a decreased need for anxiety and depression treatment, the risk for suicide-related diagnoses *increased* for transgender men post-surgery compared to the general population [5]. This suggests that even when medical transition is completed, elevated mental health risks, including for suicide, may persist or emerge.

In conclusion, while some studies propose a link between gender-affirming care and reduced suicide risk, major systematic reviews and critical analyses of the research highlight significant evidentiary weaknesses. They caution against drawing firm conclusions, pointing to poor study design, lack of control groups, and confounding variables. The scientific community remains divided on the issue, with influential reviews like the Cass Review calling for a more cautious approach grounded in higher-quality research [3].
