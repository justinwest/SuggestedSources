# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

The question of whether gender-affirming care lowers suicide risk for youth is a subject of significant scientific and public debate. While some studies suggest a positive correlation between receiving care and improved mental health outcomes, including reduced suicidality, major systematic reviews and other analyses point to a lack of high-quality evidence and methodological weaknesses in the existing research [3, 4].

### Evidence Suggesting Reduced Suicide Risk

Several studies have found an association between gender-affirming care and lower rates of depression and suicidal ideation among transgender youth.

*   A 2022 study in *JAMA Network Open* followed 104 transgender and nonbinary youths aged 13-20. The researchers found that after 12 months, the group that received gender-affirming medical care (puberty blockers or hormones) had 60% lower odds of moderate to severe depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality compared to youth who had not received such care [6].
*   A 2020 study in *Pediatrics* analyzed data from a large survey of transgender adults. It found that among those who had wanted puberty blockers as adolescents, those who received them reported lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to those who did not receive them [1].
*   A 2023 study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* on Dutch transgender youth found that after two years of receiving gender-affirming hormones, participants reported that their appearance was more aligned with their gender identity, their satisfaction with life increased, and symptoms of depression declined [7]. While not a direct measure of suicide risk, these improvements in psychosocial functioning are considered relevant protective factors.

### Critiques and Calls for More Robust Evidence

Despite these findings, several comprehensive reviews and critiques have highlighted significant limitations in the current body of evidence, arguing that it is not strong enough to establish a causal link between gender-affirming care and reduced suicide risk.

*   The **Cass Review**, an independent review commissioned by NHS England, published an interim report in 2022 that described the evidence base for gender-affirming interventions as "remarkably weak" [3]. The review noted that existing studies are often small, lack control groups, and have significant dropout rates. Specifically regarding suicide, the report stated there was "no clear evidence that puberty blockers reduce the risk of suicide" in the long term, and it called for a more cautious, research-driven approach to care [3].
*   The 2022 *JAMA Network Open* study has been subject to criticism. Journalist Jesse Singal, in a detailed analysis, pointed out that while the study's published abstract highlighted a statistically significant reduction in suicidality, this finding was from a secondary analysis. The study's primary, pre-registered analysis did not find a statistically significant change in its main mental health metrics, a fact not emphasized in the paper's conclusion [2].
*   A document titled "Treatment for Pediatric Gender Dysphoria: Review of Evidence and Best Practices," presented as an internal review for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) but written by an anonymous author and not formally published or peer-reviewed, concluded that the evidence for the benefits of medical interventions was of very low quality [4]. It argued that systematic reviews from several European health authorities had reached similar conclusions about the weak evidence base. However, this document has itself been heavily criticized. An opinion piece in *The Washington Post* by Dr. Leana S. Wen described the anonymous review as "fundamentally flawed" and unscientific for excluding studies that contradicted its conclusions [8].
*   Research on longer-term outcomes after interventions also presents a complex picture. A 2024 study in *The Journal of Sexual Medicine* on adults who had undergone gender-affirming surgery found that while the risk for some mental health conditions decreased post-surgery, the need for anxiety treatment did not, and the overall rate of suicide attempts remained significantly elevated compared to the general population. The authors note this does not mean the surgery caused the attempts, but it indicates that surgery does not resolve all underlying mental health vulnerabilities [5].

### Conclusion

There are studies that show a correlation between access to gender-affirming care and lower rates of depression and suicidality in transgender youth. Proponents of this care argue that this evidence, combined with clinical experience, is sufficient to justify providing treatment, given the high baseline rates of distress in this population.

However, major systematic reviews, most notably the Cass Review, have concluded that the evidence is not robust enough to draw firm conclusions about the long-term effects of medical interventions, including on suicide risk. Critics point to methodological flaws in existing research, such as the lack of control groups and potential for bias, and call for higher-quality, long-term studies. Therefore, there is no definitive scientific consensus on the matter; the evidence remains contested and is a key focus of ongoing research.
