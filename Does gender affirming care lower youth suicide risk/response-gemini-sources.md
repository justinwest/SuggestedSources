# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

The question of whether gender-affirming care lowers suicide risk among youth is a subject of significant medical and scientific debate. While some studies suggest an association between access to care and reduced suicidal ideation, major systematic reviews and other research have found the evidence to be of low quality and inconclusive.

### Evidence Suggesting a Link
Some observational studies report an association between gender-affirming medical interventions and improved mental health outcomes. A 2020 study in *Pediatrics* analyzed data from the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey and found that transgender adults who had wanted and received puberty blockers during adolescence had lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to those who wanted them but did not receive them [1]. Another study published in *JAMA Network Open* in 2022 followed 104 transgender and nonbinary youths for 12 months. The study's authors concluded that receiving puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones was associated with 60% lower odds of moderate to severe depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality [6].

### Evidence Showing No Link or Highlighting Uncertainty
Conversely, other researchers and major systematic evidence reviews have challenged these findings, pointing to methodological flaws and a lack of high-quality evidence.

The interim report of the Cass Review, an independent review commissioned by NHS England, concluded that the evidence base for medical interventions in this area is weak. The report noted that while proponents of early intervention argue it reduces suicide risk, "the evidence base is for all interventions is thin." Dr. Hilary Cass, the review's author, stated that the research was "a house of cards" and that it was not possible to know if medical treatments reduce suicide risk [3].

Similarly, an internal review of evidence conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 2022, which was not publicly released but later reported on, concluded that the available studies are of "low-quality" and that no firm conclusions can be drawn about the impact of gender-affirming care on mental health outcomes like suicide [4, 8]. The HHS review stated that "no conclusions can be drawn about the risk of suicide" due to the limitations of the existing research [4].

Specific studies have also been subject to criticism. Journalist Jesse Singal, in a detailed analysis of the data from the *JAMA Network Open* study, argued that the researchers' published conclusions were not supported by their own data. Singal noted that over the 12-month study period, there was no statistically significant improvement in the mental health metrics of the youth receiving treatment compared to baseline [2].

A 2023 study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* followed transgender youth in the Netherlands for two years after they started hormones. While it found improvements in life satisfaction and appearance congruence, it reported that psychosocial functioning (including emotional and behavioral problems) did not improve and that suicidality remained a "serious problem" in the cohort [7].

Furthermore, a 2024 study of Danish adults in *The Journal of Sexual Medicine* examined mental health outcomes after gender-affirming surgery. The study found that while trans women had lower rates of antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication use after surgery, trans men had higher rates. Crucially, the study found no change in the rate of suicide attempts following surgery for either group [5].

In summary, while some researchers report an association between gender-affirming care and lower suicide risk, these findings come primarily from observational studies that are subject to significant methodological critiques. In contrast, comprehensive systematic reviews from health authorities in both the UK and the US have concluded that the evidence is of low quality and insufficient to determine whether these medical interventions reduce the risk of suicide [3, 4]. Other high-quality prospective studies have not found improvements in overall psychosocial health or suicidality after medical intervention [7, 5].
