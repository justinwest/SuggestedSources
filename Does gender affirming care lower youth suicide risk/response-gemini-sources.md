# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

Based on the provided sources, the relationship between gender-affirming care and youth suicide risk is a subject of significant scientific debate. While some studies suggest a correlation between receiving care and lower rates of suicidal ideation, major reviews and other studies point to weak evidence, methodological flaws, and conflicting results, making it difficult to establish a clear causal link.

Several studies report a positive association between gender-affirming medical interventions and improved mental health outcomes. A 2022 study in *JAMA Network Open* followed a cohort of transgender and nonbinary youths and found that receiving puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones was associated with 60% lower odds of moderate to severe depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality over a 12-month period [6]. Similarly, a 2020 study in *Pediatrics* analyzed survey data and found that access to pubertal suppression was associated with lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation among transgender adults who had wanted such care as adolescents [1].

However, the quality and interpretation of this evidence are heavily contested. The interim report of the Cass Review, an independent review commissioned by NHS England, concluded that the evidence base for gender-affirming care in youth is "weak." The review noted that existing studies are often small, lack control groups, and have significant dropout rates, making it impossible to disentangle the effects of medical treatment from the psychosocial support provided alongside it [3]. It also pointed out that no single study has been able to show that puberty blockers "actually improve psychological wellbeing in the long-term" [3].

Further critiques challenge the findings of key studies. An article in *Singal-Minded* by Jesse Singal closely examines the 2022 *JAMA* study, alleging that the researchers' initial, non-statistically significant findings on depression and anxiety were altered through post-hoc changes to the statistical analysis to produce the positive results that were ultimately published [2].

Other recent, high-quality research has produced more ambiguous or null findings. A 2023 study in the *New England Journal of Medicine*, which followed Dutch transgender youth for two years after starting hormones, found that while they reported higher satisfaction with their physical appearance, their "psychosocial functioning did not show a clinically significant improvement" [7]. A systematic review commissioned by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Florida Surgeon General also concluded that the available evidence was of "very low certainty" and insufficient to establish a causal relationship between hormonal treatments and better mental health outcomes [4].

Furthermore, research into gender-affirming surgery—a later stage of care—complicates the picture. A 2024 national database study in *The Journal of Sexual Medicine* examined mental health service use after surgery. It found that while there was no change for transfeminine individuals, transmasculine individuals showed an increased risk of postoperative mental health visits for anxiety and depression, suggesting that outcomes are not uniformly positive across all interventions and populations [5].

In summary, while some observational studies report a link between gender-affirming care and lower suicide risk, this finding is not consistently supported across the scientific literature. Major systematic reviews and critiques highlight significant methodological weaknesses in the research, and some higher-quality studies have found no significant improvement in overall mental health or even identified increased risks for certain groups. Therefore, it cannot be definitively concluded from the available evidence that gender-affirming care causally lowers youth suicide risk.
