# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

## Elevated Suicide Risk in Transgender Youth  
Transgender and nonbinary youth face an alarmingly high risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Research consistently shows that transgender adolescents report far higher rates of suicidal ideation and attempts compared to their cisgender peers ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10027312/?fbclid=IwY2xjawEvsU1leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHWniVavms1fYucgB_2rQNbsQjBaXI5Lgfn7y4DULI_pZrLji0uMTvMOlQw_aem_WcmQtvHAV3BpvclzUi89RQ#:~:text=The%20literature%20to%20date%20reveals,highest%20risk%20of%20suicide%20is)). In some studies, **50–70% of trans youth** have seriously considered suicide, and around **30% or more have attempted suicide** – with the highest risk found among those under 18 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10027312/?fbclid=IwY2xjawEvsU1leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHWniVavms1fYucgB_2rQNbsQjBaXI5Lgfn7y4DULI_pZrLji0uMTvMOlQw_aem_WcmQtvHAV3BpvclzUi89RQ#:~:text=The%20literature%20to%20date%20reveals,highest%20risk%20of%20suicide%20is)). These elevated rates are linked to factors like gender dysphoria, stigma, discrimination, and lack of support, which can cause profound distress. Given this mental health crisis, a critical question is whether gender-affirming care can help reduce the risk of suicide in this vulnerable population.

## Gender-Affirming Care as a Protective Intervention  
**Gender-affirming care** refers to a range of medical, social, and psychological supports that affirm an individual’s gender identity. For youth, this care may include **social transition** (e.g. using name, pronouns, clothing that match their gender), **puberty blockers** to pause unwanted pubertal changes, **hormone therapy** (estrogen or testosterone in later adolescence), and access to affirming counseling. The goal is to **alleviate gender dysphoria** – the distress caused by a mismatch between one’s assigned birth sex and gender identity – and to create an environment where the young person feels seen and supported. By addressing the root causes of distress, gender-affirming care is *expected to improve mental health* outcomes for transgender youth. Major medical organizations (such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Endocrine Society) endorse gender-affirming care based on evidence that it can improve well-being. Importantly, this care does **not “cause” someone to be transgender**; rather, it provides relief and support to those who already are trans or gender-diverse. Improved mental health – including reductions in depression, anxiety, and self-harm – is a key aim, which in turn is hypothesized to lower the risk of suicide.

## Research Evidence for Reduced Suicide Risk  
A growing body of research indicates that gender-affirming care is **associated with lower suicide risk** among transgender and nonbinary youth. Many studies – spanning retrospective surveys, cross-sectional analyses, and prospective clinical research – **show significant mental health benefits** when young people receive treatments like puberty suppression or hormone therapy. For example, a 2020 study of transgender adults found that those who had accessed puberty blockers during adolescence had dramatically lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation than those who wanted puberty suppression but could not get it ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7073269/#:~:text=odds%20of%20lifetime%20suicidal%20ideation,confidence%20interval%20%3D%200.2%E2%80%930.6)). In that study, exposure to puberty blockers was associated with an **adjusted odds ratio of about 0.3 for lifetime suicidal ideation**, meaning roughly a 70% reduction in odds of serious thoughts of suicide compared to peers who did not receive this care ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7073269/#:~:text=odds%20of%20lifetime%20suicidal%20ideation,confidence%20interval%20%3D%200.2%E2%80%930.6)). This finding aligns with past literature suggesting that timely medical affirmation in adolescence has *favorable mental health outcomes* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7073269/#:~:text=odds%20of%20lifetime%20suicidal%20ideation,confidence%20interval%20%3D%200.2%E2%80%930.6)).

Large youth-focused studies have reported similar protective effects from gender-affirming hormone therapy. In a 2022 analysis of over 9,000 transgender and nonbinary youth (aged 13–24), researchers found that those receiving gender-affirming hormones had significantly **lower rates of depression and suicidality** than those who wanted treatment but were unable to access it ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920935/#:~:text=of%20GAHT%20was%20associated%20with,.05)). Specifically, youth on hormone therapy had about **25–30% lower odds of recent severe depression and of seriously considering suicide** in the past year, compared to trans youth not on hormones ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920935/#:~:text=of%20GAHT%20was%20associated%20with,.05)). Crucially, among adolescents under 18, access to hormones was linked to about a **39% lower odds of having attempted suicide in the last year** (adjusted odds ~0.61) relative to those who needed but did not receive hormone treatment ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920935/#:~:text=of%20GAHT%20was%20associated%20with,.05)). These statistics underscore a strong association between receiving gender-affirming medical care and reduced suicidal ideation and attempts.

Perhaps the most compelling evidence comes from **prospective studies** that track mental health over time as youth receive care. A 2022 longitudinal study published in *JAMA Network Open* followed a cohort of transgender and nonbinary adolescents receiving care at a gender clinic. After 12 months of gender-affirming treatment (puberty blockers or hormones), the youths showed marked improvements in mental health compared to baseline and to a subgroup who had not yet started treatment ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423/#:~:text=Our%20study%20provides%20quantitative%20evidence,Beyond%20the%20need%20to%20address)) ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1181%20odds%20of,aOR)). Notably, access to treatment was associated with a **73% lower odds of reporting suicidal thoughts or self-harm** by the 1-year follow-up, compared to those awaiting treatment ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1181%20odds%20of,aOR)). The treated group also had significantly lower rates of moderate-to-severe depression, while no increase in anxiety was observed ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423/#:~:text=lower%20odds%20of%20depression%20,CI%2C%200.41%2C%202.51)) ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1181%20odds%20of,aOR)). The authors concluded that gender-affirming medical care was linked to *quantifiable mental health benefits in a short time frame*, including **decreased suicidality**, for these youths ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423/#:~:text=Our%20study%20provides%20quantitative%20evidence,Beyond%20the%20need%20to%20address)). Such findings provide evidence that affirming interventions can directly contribute to better psychological outcomes, thereby likely reducing suicide risk.

The overall trend across studies is clear: **gender affirmation correlates with improved mental health and fewer suicide attempts**. A 2023 narrative review of the research literature noted that *the majority of studies* on gender-affirming treatments have found **reductions in suicidality** following care ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10027312/?fbclid=IwY2xjawEvsU1leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHWniVavms1fYucgB_2rQNbsQjBaXI5Lgfn7y4DULI_pZrLji0uMTvMOlQw_aem_WcmQtvHAV3BpvclzUi89RQ#:~:text=was%20undertaken%20evaluating%20suicide,systematic%20reviews%20given%20the%20inherent)). While each study has limitations, this review reinforces that the balance of evidence points toward positive mental health impacts. In short, when transgender youth receive appropriate gender-affirming care, they tend to experience *less severe depression and dysphoria*, and they are **less likely to harbor suicidal thoughts or engage in self-harm** compared to those denied such care.

## The Role of Support and Acceptance  
It’s important to recognize that gender-affirming care often occurs in the context of broader **social support**, which itself is a powerful protective factor against youth suicide. Acceptance from family, peers, and community goes hand-in-hand with affirming medical care to improve outcomes. Studies have shown that transgender youths who feel supported and affirmed in their gender identity are far less likely to attempt suicide than those who face rejection. For instance, one large survey found that having even a single accepting adult in a trans youth’s life was associated with about **one-third lower odds of a suicide attempt in the past year** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9991447/#:~:text=reported%20gender%20identity%20acceptance%20from,was%20particularly%20impactful%20for%20transgender)). Acceptance from peers (such as friends or classmates) likewise corresponded to significantly reduced suicide risk ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9991447/#:~:text=reported%20gender%20identity%20acceptance%20from,was%20particularly%20impactful%20for%20transgender)). In other research, transgender children who are **supported in socially transitioning** (living as their identified gender) exhibit **normal levels of depression** and only slight elevations in anxiety, comparable to their non-transgender peers ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4771131/#:~:text=Transgender%20children%20showed%20no%20elevations,only%20marginally%20higher%20anxiety%20symptoms)). This contrasts sharply with the high rates of depression and suicidality seen historically in gender-dysphoric youth who lack support. Together, such findings highlight that *affirmation and support* – whether through medical care, use of correct name/pronouns, or a loving home/school environment – can substantially improve a young person’s mental health. Gender-affirming care often facilitates this supportive environment (for example, by validating a youth’s identity and easing their distress), thereby **indirectly and directly protecting against suicidality**. In essence, when society and healthcare providers embrace a transgender young person’s identity, the relief from minority stress and dysphoria can literally be life-saving.

## Conclusion  
**Yes – the evidence strongly indicates that gender-affirming care lowers suicide risk among transgender youth.** Multiple studies from diverse samples have found that youths receiving puberty blockers or hormone therapy experience *significantly fewer suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts* than those who do not receive needed care ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920935/#:~:text=of%20GAHT%20was%20associated%20with,.05)) ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1181%20odds%20of,aOR)). Affirming interventions are associated with reduced depression and improved overall mental well-being, which are key factors in suicide prevention. While no intervention can eliminate all suicide risk and transgender youth may still face challenges, gender-affirming care provides critical relief from the acute distress of gender dysphoria and fosters a supportive context that protects mental health. Health experts emphasize that denying such care – or subjecting trans youth to “conversion” efforts – can **worsen dysphoria and heighten suicide risk**, whereas providing appropriate treatment and support has the opposite effect. It’s important to note that most studies are observational (for ethical reasons, we lack randomized trials), so ongoing research is needed to continue evaluating long-term outcomes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10027312/?fbclid=IwY2xjawEvsU1leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHWniVavms1fYucgB_2rQNbsQjBaXI5Lgfn7y4DULI_pZrLji0uMTvMOlQw_aem_WcmQtvHAV3BpvclzUi89RQ#:~:text=was%20undertaken%20evaluating%20suicide,systematic%20reviews%20given%20the%20inherent)). Nonetheless, the **consensus in the medical and mental health community** is that gender-affirming care is beneficial. By helping transgender youth live as their authentic selves, this care significantly *reduces their despair and suicidal ideation*, giving them a much better chance to thrive into adulthood ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423/#:~:text=Our%20study%20provides%20quantitative%20evidence,Beyond%20the%20need%20to%20address)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920935/#:~:text=of%20GAHT%20was%20associated%20with,.05)). In summary, gender-affirming care – combined with a loving, accepting environment – can be a life-saving intervention that **lowers the risk of suicide** for transgender and gender-diverse young people.
