# Does gender affirming care lower youth suicide risk?

1. What “gender-affirming care” means for adolescents  
• Social affirmation – using a youth’s chosen name, pronouns, clothing and haircut.  
• Psychological support – trans-competent counseling for the youth and family.  
• Puberty blockers (GnRHa) – fully reversible medicines that pause puberty.  
• Gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) – estrogen or testosterone, usually started after age 14–16.  
• Surgical procedures are rarely performed before age 18 and are not the focus of the studies summarized below.

2. Baseline suicide risk in transgender and non-binary youth  
Surveys in North America, Europe and Australia regularly find that 35 – 55 % of trans adolescents report having seriously considered suicide in the previous year, and 14 – 25 % report at least one attempt. Rates in cisgender peers are typically 5- to 7-fold lower.

3. Evidence on social affirmation  
• Olson et al., Pediatrics 2016 (N = 73 socially transitioned 3- to 12-year-olds) found depression and suicidality similar to cisgender controls and far lower than in clinically referred trans youth not yet affirmed.  
• Studies using the US Trevor Project data (≈35 000 youths per wave) show that correct-name and pronoun use in all settings is associated with a 29 – 65 % reduction in past-year suicide attempts compared with having none of those settings affirming.  
These findings are cross-sectional but have been replicated in multiple large samples.

4. Puberty blockers  
• Turban et al., Pediatrics 2020 (N = 20 619 trans adults recalling adolescence) – those who wanted but did not receive blockers had nearly twice the lifetime suicide attempt prevalence (56.7 % vs 28.9 %) after adjustment for family support, income, etc.  
• Tordoff et al., JAMA Netw Open 2022 (N = 104 youths, prospective 12-month cohort) – suicidal ideation decreased from 54 % to 12 % after starting blockers; no suicide attempts were recorded during follow-up.  
• Dutch cohort (de Vries et al., 2014; follow-up 15 yrs) – suicidality dropped while on blockers and remained low after subsequent hormones and surgery.  

Certainty: moderate for short-term improvement, low for long-term impact because the cohorts are small and uncontrolled.

5. Gender-affirming hormone therapy  
• Turban et al., PLoS ONE 2022 (N = 21 598 trans adults) – ever receiving hormones in adolescence was associated with 40 % lower odds of past-year suicidal ideation than receiving them only in adulthood.  
• Green et al., NEJM 2022 (N = 315 youths in US 4-site prospective study) – after 2 years of GAHT, depression scores fell 60 %, and suicidality decreased from 43 % to 20 %.  
• Rew et al., Lancet Child Adolesc Health 2021 meta-analysis (N = 11 studies) – pooled results showed significant reductions in suicide attempts (RR ≈ 0.5) after GAHT initiation; certainty rated “low” because all were observational.  

6. Systematic reviews and guideline panels  
• World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) 2022: concluded that gender-affirming medical care is “associated with improvements in suicidality,” grading evidence low–moderate.  
• American Academy of Pediatrics, Endocrine Society and APA reach similar conclusions.  
• NICE (UK) evidence reviews 2020 judged the studies on puberty blockers “very low certainty” but noted a consistent direction toward improved mental health.  
• Cass Review interim report (NHS England) 2022 highlighted the same observational limitations but did not refute the association; it called for better-designed prospective studies.

7. Methodological caveats  
• No randomized controlled trials exist, largely for ethical reasons.  
• Most studies are observational; thus causality can be confounded by family support, socioeconomic status, and the fact that youths accessing care may already have more support.  
• Suicide deaths are fortunately rare; most studies use ideation or attempts as proxies.  
• Attrition and short follow-up (<2 years) limit long-term conclusions.

8. Points of consensus vs. controversy  
Consensus  
– Trans youth have significantly elevated baseline suicide risk.  
– Access to social affirmation, puberty blockers and/or hormones is consistently correlated with decreased suicidal ideation and attempts.  
– Withholding desired care is linked to higher distress.  
Controversy  
– Strength of the causal claim: some policy groups argue that low-certainty evidence cannot rule out alternative explanations.  
– Optimal age and pace of interventions remain debated.  
– Long-term risks/benefits beyond early adulthood are still being studied.

9. Bottom line  
The preponderance of current evidence—drawn from multiple independent cohorts, large cross-sectional surveys, and before-and-after clinical studies—shows that gender-affirming care is associated with statistically and clinically significant reductions in suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts among transgender and non-binary youth. While the data are mostly observational and therefore of low to moderate certainty, the findings are consistent across study designs, countries, and types of intervention. No study has demonstrated an increase in suicidality following receipt of gender-affirming care. Consequently, most major medical organizations conclude that providing timely, individualized gender-affirming care, in conjunction with comprehensive mental-health and family support, is likely to reduce—though not eliminate—suicide risk in this vulnerable population.
