**High Suicide Risk in Transgender Youth:** Transgender and gender-diverse youth face disproportionately high rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Studies estimate that around 40% of transgender people have attempted suicide at least once, far above the rate in the general population ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7073269/#:~:text=This%20study%20is%20the%20first,receive%20it%20endorsed%20lifetime%20suicidal)). Lack of access to gender-affirming care has been linked to especially high suicidality – for example, about 90% of trans adolescents who wanted puberty blockers but did not receive them reported lifetime suicidal ideation in one survey ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7073269/#:~:text=This%20study%20is%20the%20first,receive%20it%20endorsed%20lifetime%20suicidal)). This heightened risk underscores the importance of interventions that can improve mental health outcomes in this vulnerable group.

**Evidence That Gender-Affirming Care Lowers Suicide Risk:** A growing body of research indicates that gender-affirming medical care (such as puberty suppression and hormone therapy) is associated with better mental health and reduced suicidal behavior among transgender youth. A 2023 narrative review of 23 studies on gender-affirming treatments found that **the majority of those studies reported a reduction in suicidality following treatment**, although the review noted many studies had methodological limitations ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10027312/?fbclid=IwY2xjawEvsU1leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHWniVavms1fYucgB_2rQNbsQjBaXI5Lgfn7y4DULI_pZrLji0uMTvMOlQw_aem_WcmQtvHAV3BpvclzUi89RQ#:~:text=was%20undertaken%20evaluating%20suicide,the%20presence%20of%20psychiatric%20comorbidity)). Likewise, multiple individual studies have reported significant drops in depression and suicidal ideation or attempts after trans youth receive gender-affirming care. For instance, a large 2022 survey of transgender and nonbinary youth (ages 13–24) found that those **receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy had markedly lower rates of recent depression and suicidal thoughts** compared to peers who wanted treatment but could not access it ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920935/#:~:text=of%20GAHT%20was%20associated%20with,.05)). Among transgender adolescents under 18, access to hormones was associated with about a 40% lower odds of recent depression and of a past-year suicide attempt relative to those not receiving treatment ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920935/#:~:text=of%20GAHT%20was%20associated%20with,.05)). Similarly, a prospective 12-month study published in 2022 tracked over 100 trans and nonbinary youth starting puberty blockers or hormones and observed **substantial mental health improvements** – the treated youth had roughly **60% lower odds of moderate-to-severe depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality** after one year, compared to youth who had not begun gender-affirming treatment ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423/#:~:text=Findings%C2%A0%20In%20this%20prospective%20cohort,up)). In other words, youth who received timely gender-affirming medical care were significantly less likely to suffer serious depression or consider self-harm than those who did not.

**Research Findings and Long-Term Outcomes:** Additional research bolsters the link between gender-affirming care and reduced suicide risk. One study of U.S. transgender adults found that those who had access to puberty suppression during adolescence were **much less likely to experience suicidal ideation** in adulthood than those who wanted puberty blockers but were denied treatment ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7073269/#:~:text=This%20study%20is%20the%20first,receive%20it%20endorsed%20lifetime%20suicidal)). This association held true even after accounting for factors like family support, suggesting a direct benefit of appropriate medical intervention. Furthermore, long-term studies from gender clinics indicate positive outcomes when transgender youth receive comprehensive gender-affirming care. For example, a Dutch study followed a cohort of transgender adolescents who underwent a multidisciplinary gender-affirming treatment protocol – **puberty blockers in early adolescence, followed by hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries in young adulthood**. The researchers reported that after completing treatment, the youths’ gender dysphoria was relieved and their overall psychological functioning **steadily improved to levels comparable to their non-transgender peers** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25201798/#:~:text=Results%3A%20After%20gender%20reassignment%2C%20in,being)). These young adults had well-being scores similar or even higher than the general population, and there were no reports of suicide in the group, suggesting that access to gender-affirming care can dramatically improve mental health trajectories for trans youth.

**Consensus and Considerations:** In light of this evidence, leading medical organizations and experts agree that gender-affirming care is a crucial component of supporting the health of transgender youth. Studies consistently show that such care is associated with *lower* rates of depression, self-harm, and suicidal behavior in this population ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920935/#:~:text=of%20GAHT%20was%20associated%20with,.05)) ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423/#:~:text=Findings%C2%A0%20In%20this%20prospective%20cohort,up)). While it’s important to acknowledge that most available studies are observational (and thus cannot prove absolute cause-and-effect), the overall trend across research strongly suggests that affirming a young person’s gender identity through appropriate medical and social support *helps* protect against suicidal ideation and attempts [1][2]. Experts emphasize that denying or delaying gender-affirming interventions can leave youth at higher risk, whereas providing this care as part of a comprehensive support network (including mental health care and family acceptance) can be life-saving. In summary, the best available evidence indicates that gender-affirming care is associated with **lower suicide risk among transgender youth**, contributing to improved mental health and quality of life for this high-risk group.
