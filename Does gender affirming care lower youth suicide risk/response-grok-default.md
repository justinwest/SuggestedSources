Gender-affirming care (GAC) refers to a range of medical, psychological, and social interventions designed to support transgender and gender-diverse individuals in aligning their physical appearance and social experiences with their gender identity. For youth, this can include social affirmation (e.g., using preferred names and pronouns), puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and in rare cases, surgical interventions [1]. The question of whether GAC lowers suicide risk among transgender youth is a topic of ongoing research and debate, particularly given the high rates of suicidality in this population. Transgender youth experience significantly elevated risks of suicidal ideation, attempts, and completion compared to their cisgender peers, often due to factors like discrimination, family rejection, and lack of support [2].

### Evidence Supporting a Reduction in Suicide Risk
Several studies have found associations between access to GAC and reduced mental health risks, including suicidality. For instance, a longitudinal study of 104 transgender youth in the United States tracked participants over 12 months and found that those receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) experienced a 60% reduction in depression and a 73% reduction in suicidality compared to those who wanted but did not receive treatment [3]. Similarly, a large survey-based study involving over 34,000 LGBTQ+ youth reported that access to GAHT was associated with lower odds of recent suicidal ideation (adjusted odds ratio of 0.6) and suicide attempts, especially when initiated during adolescence [4]. These findings align with guidelines from organizations like the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and the American Academy of Pediatrics, which endorse GAC as a means to alleviate gender dysphoria and improve mental health outcomes [1][2].

Cross-sectional data from The Trevor Project's national surveys further supports this. In a 2022 survey of nearly 34,000 LGBTQ+ youth aged 13-24, those who received hormone therapy reported 25% lower rates of suicide attempts in the past year compared to those who wanted but did not access it [5]. Proponents argue that GAC addresses the distress of gender dysphoria, which is a key driver of suicidality, and that delaying care can exacerbate risks [2].

### Evidence Questioning or Limiting the Benefits
However, not all research unequivocally supports these benefits, and some studies highlight methodological limitations or null findings. A comprehensive review commissioned by England's National Health Service (the Cass Review) analyzed over 100 studies on GAC for youth and concluded that the evidence base is "remarkably weak," with most studies being of low quality due to issues like small sample sizes, lack of control groups, and short follow-up periods [6]. The review did not find strong evidence that GAC directly reduces suicide risk and recommended restricting puberty blockers and hormones for minors outside of research settings, emphasizing the need for more holistic mental health support [6].

Additionally, a 2024 population-based study from Finland examined suicide rates among 2,083 gender-referred youth under age 23 who sought treatment between 1996 and 2019. It found no significant difference in suicide mortality between those who received GAC (including hormones and surgeries) and the general population after adjusting for psychiatric history, suggesting that medical interventions alone may not mitigate suicide risk without addressing co-occurring mental health issues [7]. Critics of GAC also point to potential risks, such as unknown long-term effects of puberty blockers on bone density and fertility, and argue that high suicidality rates may persist due to external factors like societal stigma rather than being directly alleviated by medical transition [6][8].

A 2023 systematic review in the Journal of Adolescent Health echoed these concerns, noting that while some studies show short-term improvements in mood and body satisfaction, evidence for long-term suicide prevention is inconsistent and often confounded by factors like family support [8].

### Overall Assessment and Considerations
The evidence is mixed but leans toward GAC being associated with reduced suicide risk in many observational studies, particularly when care is provided in supportive environments [3][4][5]. However, high-quality randomized controlled trials are lacking due to ethical challenges (e.g., withholding potentially life-saving care), leading to reliance on cohort and survey data that may not establish causality [6]. Factors like access to mental health services, family acceptance, and anti-discrimination protections appear to play significant roles in outcomes, suggesting GAC is most effective as part of a comprehensive approach [2]. Critics emphasize caution for youth, given the potential for regret or detransition (estimated at 1-8% in various studies) and the need for more rigorous research [6][7].

In summary, while multiple studies indicate that GAC can lower suicide risk for transgender youth, the evidence is not conclusive, and ongoing debates highlight the importance of individualized, evidence-based care. Policymakers and clinicians should weigh these findings alongside emerging research, and youth should receive multidisciplinary support to address all aspects of their well-being.
