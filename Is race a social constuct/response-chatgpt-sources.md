Race is a complex and debated concept, intersecting the biological, social, and political spheres, complicating straightforward definitions. The consensus among scholars and scientists reflects that race, while having a biological basis in genetic variations across populations, is predominantly a social construct shaped by historical, political, and socio-economic factors (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). This nuanced viewpoint reconciles the evidence of minor genetic differences across human populations with the overwhelming influence of sociopolitical constructs that define and give meaning to these differences.

The biological aspect of race is acknowledged through research demonstrating that genetic variations can indeed correlate with geographic ancestries (Global Genetic Differentiation of Complex Traits Shaped by Natural Selection in Humans). However, these differences are relatively minor and account for a small fraction of genetic variability among humans. The capacity of AI to recognize patient race in medical imaging (AI Recognition of Patient Race in Medical Imaging) hints at the presence of biological markers associated with race, yet this recognition also underscores the variability within racial groups and the dangers of conflating biological traits with socially constructed racial categories.

The social constructivist view posits that race has been utilized to categorize and divide people based on perceived physical differences, with little regard for the underlying genetic homogeneity among humans (Race: A Social Destruction of a Biological Concept). This perspective is supported by historical shifts in the concept of race, as influenced by UNESCO's interventions, highlighting the malleability of racial categories in response to changing social and political contexts (Changing the Concept of Race: On UNESCO and Cultural Internationalism).

Critical discourse challenges the rigidity of racial thinking, emphasizing conformity in discussions around race that often overlooks its constructed nature (Discourse on Race Has a Conformity Problem). Meanwhile, the field of genomics offers a dual lens: it reveals the fluid boundaries of genetic ancestry, complicating race as a biological category (Imputation of race and ethnicity categories using continental genetic ancestry from real-world genomic testing data), while also contributing to a more nuanced understanding of how genetics intersects with socially constructed notions of race (How Genetics Is Changing Our Understanding of "Race").

In essence, the intersection of genetics and social constructs of race underscores the complexity of the concept. Race emerges not from clear-cut biological imperatives but from the interplay between genetic variations and the significant weight of social, historical, and political meanings ascribed to these differences (Once again: are “races” social constructs without scientific or biological meaning?). Thus, while not devoid of a biological basis, race is primarily a flexible, socially constructed entity that reflects broader societal valuations and divisions.
