Based on the provided sources, the question of whether race is a social construct is addressed from multiple perspectives within academia, science, and public discourse. These sources collectively underscore the complexity of race, elucidating its sociocultural dimensions, genetic underpinnings, and the ongoing debate surrounding its definition and significance.

The notion that race is a social construct is supported by several pieces of scholarly work. For example, the article in "Ethnicities" focusing on UNESCO's efforts to change the concept of race highlights the organization's historical role in promoting the understanding of race as a sociopolitical, rather than a biological, construct (Changing the Concept of Race: On UNESCO and Cultural Internationalism, 2020). This effort underscores the influence of cultural and international perspectives on the conceptualization of race, advocating for an understanding of race that prioritizes social and cultural contexts over biological differences.

Similarly, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on race elaborates on the multifaceted definitions of race, detailing the arguments for considering race as primarily a social construct shaped by historical, economic, and political forces rather than strict biological distinctions (Race – Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). This source provides a philosophical and theoretical framework that supports the conception of race as constructed through social interactions and societal beliefs.

Furthermore, "Race: A Social Destruction of a Biological Concept" in "Biology & Philosophy" (2009) critiques the biological basis of race categorization, suggesting that the social implications and constructs of race have overshadowed and distorted any potential biological underpinnings, arguing for the understanding of race as a social construct that has significant biological consequences but is not itself rooted in biological differences.

On the other hand, discussions on the genetic differentiation among human populations bring nuance to the debate. For instance, the research article in "Nature Communications" on genetic ancestry and population structure within the "All of Us Research Program" cohort suggests that genetic variations can be observed among different populations, reflecting a complex interplay between genetic ancestry and socially constructed races (Genetic Ancestry and Population Structure in the All of Us Research Program Cohort, Nature Communications).

Moreover, "Lewontin’s Fallacy" critiqued by A.W.F. Edwards in "BioEssays" (2003) challenges the argument that race lacks a genetic basis, emphasizing statistical relevance in genetic differentiation among races (Lewontin’s Fallacy). Edwards argues that while genetic variation within populations is significant, there is still a measurable level of genetic differentiation that can be correlated with traditional racial groupings.

This evidence from the scientific community introduces a critical perspective: while racial categories do not align neatly with genetic markers, there is a complex relationship between genetic diversity and social definitions of race that cannot be entirely dismissed.

In synthesis, the compilation of these sources illustrates the intricate debate surrounding the concept of race. It is evident that race is a constructed entity, heavily influenced by social, cultural, and historical contexts. However, this does not entirely preclude the biological aspects that may intersect with socially defined racial categories. The dialogue between these perspectives highlights the ongoing evolution of our understanding of race, advocating for a nuanced approach that considers both the social constructions and the scientific investigations into human diversity.
