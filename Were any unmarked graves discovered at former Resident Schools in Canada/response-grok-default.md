Yes, numerous unmarked graves have been discovered at sites of former Indian Residential Schools in Canada. These discoveries, primarily identified through ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys and supported by historical records, have highlighted the tragic legacy of the residential school system, which operated from the 1880s to the 1990s and forcibly separated Indigenous children from their families, leading to widespread abuse, neglect, and deaths [1]. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC), established in 2008, documented that at least 4,100 children died while attending these schools, many from disease, malnutrition, or accidents, and noted that unmarked graves were common due to inadequate record-keeping and burial practices [2]. Below, I outline the key discoveries, their context, and ongoing implications, based on verified reports.

### Key Discoveries of Unmarked Graves
Starting in 2021, several Indigenous communities announced findings of unmarked graves at former residential school sites, prompting national mourning, investigations, and calls for reconciliation. These detections typically involve GPR technology, which identifies soil disturbances consistent with graves but does not involve exhumation unless further steps are taken. As of 2023, no large-scale excavations have confirmed human remains in many cases, but the findings align with survivor testimonies and archival evidence of child deaths [3]. Notable examples include:

1. **Kamloops Indian Residential School (British Columbia)**: In May 2021, the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation reported the discovery of 215 potential unmarked graves of children using GPR. This site, operated by the Catholic Church from 1890 to 1969, was one of the largest residential schools in Canada. The announcement sparked global attention and led to the lowering of flags across the country [1].

2. **Marieval Indian Residential School (Saskatchewan)**: In June 2021, the Cowessess First Nation announced the detection of 751 unmarked graves at this former school, which operated from 1899 to 1997. Historical records indicate that a cemetery was once marked but that headstones were removed in the 1960s, contributing to the unmarked status [4].

3. **St. Joseph's Mission Residential School (British Columbia)**: In June 2021, the Williams Lake First Nation identified 93 potential unmarked graves using GPR and other geophysical methods. This school operated from 1891 to 1981 [5].

4. **Other Sites**: Additional discoveries include 182 unmarked graves at the former St. Eugene's Mission School near Cranbrook, BC (announced in June 2021 by the ʔaq̓am Community) [6], and 169 potential graves at the former Grouard Residential School in Alberta (announced in 2022 by the Kapawe'no First Nation) [7]. In total, over 2,000 potential unmarked graves have been identified across multiple sites as of 2023, with investigations ongoing at dozens more former schools [2][3].

These findings are not exhaustive; the TRC's 2015 report called for systematic searches at all 139 residential school sites, estimating that the true number of deaths could be as high as 6,000 due to incomplete records [2]. Some communities have chosen not to pursue excavations out of respect for cultural protocols and to avoid further trauma [3].

### Context and Broader Implications
The residential school system, funded by the Canadian government and often run by churches, aimed to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture, resulting in cultural genocide as recognized by the TRC [2]. Many deaths were not reported to families, and burials were often in unmarked or mass graves to cut costs [1][2]. The 2021 discoveries led to significant actions, including:
- Federal funding of $320 million for searches and memorials [3].
- Apologies from religious institutions, such as Pope Francis's 2022 visit to Canada to address the Catholic Church's role [8].
- Increased awareness of Indigenous issues, though some critics argue that media coverage has sometimes sensationalized preliminary GPR findings without emphasizing the need for confirmation [9].

Controversies have arisen, with some reports clarifying that "discoveries" refer to detected anomalies rather than exhumed bodies, and a few isolated incidents of misinformation (e.g., unfounded claims of mass murders) have been debunked [9]. However, Indigenous leaders and experts emphasize that these findings validate long-standing oral histories of missing children [1][4].

### Ongoing Efforts
As of 2023, searches continue, supported by the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation and Indigenous-led initiatives. The Canadian government has committed to repatriating remains where requested and preserving sites [3]. For the most current information, consult official sources like the TRC or Indigenous community announcements.

In summary, yes, unmarked graves have been discovered at multiple former residential schools in Canada, underscoring a dark chapter in the nation's history and the need for continued reconciliation efforts.
