Yes, unmarked graves have been discovered at several former Residential Schools in Canada. These discoveries, primarily identified through ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys and other non-invasive methods, have brought renewed attention to the tragic legacy of the Indian Residential School system, which operated from the 1870s to the 1990s and forcibly separated Indigenous children from their families, often resulting in abuse, neglect, and high mortality rates [1]. Below, I provide a comprehensive overview of key discoveries, historical context, and ongoing implications, based on verified reports and investigations.

### Key Discoveries of Unmarked Graves
Since 2021, several Indigenous communities have announced findings of unmarked graves at or near former Residential School sites. These are typically burial sites that were not documented or marked, often containing the remains of children who died while attending the schools due to disease, malnutrition, abuse, or other causes. It's important to note that while GPR detects anomalies consistent with graves, full excavations are rare due to cultural sensitivities and the desire to avoid disturbing remains [2]. Here are some of the most significant announcements:

- **Kamloops Indian Residential School (British Columbia)**: In May 2021, the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation reported the discovery of 215 unmarked graves using GPR. This school, operated by the Catholic Church from 1890 to 1969, was one of the largest in Canada and is estimated to have had hundreds of student deaths, many undocumented [1][3].
  
- **Marieval Indian Residential School (Saskatchewan)**: In June 2021, the Cowessess First Nation announced the detection of 751 unmarked graves at this site, which operated from 1899 to 1997. The graves were found in a cemetery that had its markers removed in the 1960s, highlighting issues of historical erasure [2][4].

- **St. Joseph's Mission Residential School (British Columbia)**: In June 2021, the Williams Lake First Nation identified 93 potential unmarked graves near this former school, which ran from 1891 to 1981 [3].

- **Brandon Indian Residential School (Manitoba)**: In 2022, researchers from the Sioux Valley Dakota Nation and others reported finding 104 potential unmarked graves at this site, operational from 1895 to 1972 [5].

- **Other Sites**: Additional discoveries include 182 unmarked graves at the former St. Eugene's Mission School in Cranbrook, British Columbia (announced in June 2021 by the ʔaq'am community), and 169 potential graves at the former Alberni Indian Residential School in Port Alberni, British Columbia (announced in 2021 by the Tseshaht First Nation) [3][4]. As of 2023, investigations at over 100 former school sites are ongoing, with more findings expected [2].

These discoveries are not exhaustive; the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC) documented at least 4,100 child deaths at Residential Schools, but estimates suggest the true number could be as high as 15,000–20,000, with many burials unmarked or unrecorded [1][2].

### Historical Context
The Indian Residential School system was a government-funded, church-run network designed to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture, often described as cultural genocide by the TRC [1]. Over 150,000 Indigenous children attended these schools, where conditions were harsh, leading to widespread deaths from tuberculosis, influenza, and other preventable causes. Records were poorly kept, and families were rarely notified of deaths or burial locations [2]. The TRC's 2015 final report called for investigations into missing children and unmarked graves, which spurred the recent GPR surveys funded by the Canadian government [1][3].

Prior to 2021, some unmarked graves were known or suspected, but the Kamloops announcement triggered a national reckoning, including public apologies from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Pope Francis, as well as commitments to further searches [4][5].

### Ongoing Implications and Responses
These findings have led to calls for justice, including full implementation of the TRC's 94 Calls to Action, increased funding for mental health support in Indigenous communities, and demands for accountability from the Catholic Church and Canadian government [1][2]. As of 2023, the federal government has allocated over $200 million for searches, but critics argue progress is slow [3]. Importantly, not all detected sites have been confirmed as graves through excavation; some anomalies could be other disturbances, though Indigenous leaders emphasize the cultural and emotional significance of these findings [4].

In summary, yes, unmarked graves have been discovered at multiple former Residential Schools in Canada, underscoring the need for continued reconciliation efforts. These revelations highlight a dark chapter in Canadian history and the resilience of Indigenous peoples in seeking truth.
