Yes, numerous unmarked graves and burial sites have been discovered at former residential school locations across Canada, particularly following ground-penetrating radar surveys that began in earnest in 2021.

## Major Discoveries

The most significant discovery occurred at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia, where the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation announced in May 2021 that ground-penetrating radar had identified what are believed to be the remains of 215 children [1]. This announcement sparked a wave of similar investigations across Canada.

Shortly after, the Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan reported the discovery of 751 unmarked graves at the former Marieval Indian Residential School site [2]. Other significant findings include:

- 182 unmarked graves at the former St. Eugene's Mission School in Cranbrook, British Columbia [3]
- 93 potential burial sites at the Kamloops Indian Residential School following additional surveys [4]
- Multiple discoveries at former residential school sites in Manitoba, Alberta, and other provinces [5]

## Important Distinctions

It's crucial to note that these discoveries represent "potential burials" or "soil disturbances consistent with graves" rather than confirmed human remains in most cases. Ground-penetrating radar can identify anomalies in soil that suggest burial sites, but physical excavation is typically required for confirmation [6]. Many Indigenous communities have chosen not to disturb these sites out of respect for cultural protocols and the wishes of families.

## Historical Context

These discoveries align with historical records indicating that many children died at residential schools due to disease, malnutrition, and poor living conditions. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, which concluded its work in 2015, had previously documented that at least 3,200 children died at residential schools, though commissioners believed the actual number was likely much higher [7]. Many of these deaths were poorly documented, and families were often not informed when their children died.

## Ongoing Investigations

The discoveries have prompted increased funding from the federal government for Indigenous communities to conduct their own searches and investigations. The government committed over $320 million in 2021 to support community-led initiatives to locate and commemorate children who died at residential schools [8].
