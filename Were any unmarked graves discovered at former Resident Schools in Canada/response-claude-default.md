Yes, numerous unmarked graves and burial sites have been discovered at former residential school locations across Canada, particularly following the use of ground-penetrating radar technology beginning in 2021.

## Major Discoveries

The most significant discovery occurred at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia, where the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation announced in May 2021 that ground-penetrating radar had detected what are believed to be the remains of 215 children [1]. This discovery brought international attention to the legacy of Canada's residential school system and prompted searches at other former school sites across the country.

Following the Kamloops announcement, several other significant discoveries were made:

- At the former Marieval Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan, the Cowessess First Nation reported finding 751 unmarked graves in June 2021 [2]
- Near the former St. Eugene's Mission School in British Columbia, the Lower Kootenay Band identified 182 unmarked graves [3]
- At the former Kuper Island Industrial School in British Columbia, the Penelakut Tribe found over 160 unmarked graves [4]
- Multiple other sites across provinces including Alberta, Manitoba, and Ontario have reported similar findings [5]

## Technical and Investigative Approach

These discoveries have primarily relied on ground-penetrating radar technology, which can detect soil disturbances and anomalies consistent with burial sites without requiring excavation [6]. However, it's important to note that while these technologies can identify potential grave sites, physical excavation and forensic analysis would be required to definitively confirm the presence of human remains and determine causes of death.

## Historical Context

The residential school system operated in Canada from the 1870s to 1996, with the stated goal of assimilating Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, which released its final report in 2015, documented the deaths of at least 3,200 children at these institutions, though the actual number is believed to be much higher [7]. Many children who died at these schools were buried in unmarked graves on or near school grounds, often without their families being notified.

## Ongoing Impact and Response

These discoveries have had profound impacts on Indigenous communities and Canadian society more broadly. They have renewed calls for justice, accountability, and reconciliation, while also triggering a national reckoning with the legacy of the residential school system [8]. The federal government has committed funding to support Indigenous communities in their search efforts and to preserve and commemorate burial sites.
