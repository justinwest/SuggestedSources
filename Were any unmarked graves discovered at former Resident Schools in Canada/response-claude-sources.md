Based on the available evidence, no unmarked graves have been physically discovered or excavated at former residential schools in Canada, despite widespread media reports claiming otherwise.

The most prominent case involves the Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia. In May 2021, the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation announced that ground-penetrating radar had detected "potential burials" of 215 children at the former school site [2]. However, this announcement was widely misreported in media as the "discovery" of graves, when in fact only soil anomalies were detected through remote sensing technology.

Ground-penetrating radar can identify subsurface disturbances and anomalies, but these readings require physical excavation and forensic analysis to confirm whether they represent actual graves, their age, or their contents [1][2]. The technology cannot determine if remains are present, their identity, age, or cause of death without archaeological investigation.

Despite the initial announcements and subsequent media coverage, no physical excavation has been conducted at Kamloops or other residential school sites where similar radar anomalies have been reported [1][2]. The claims remain unverified through standard archaeological and forensic methods that would be required to confirm the presence of unmarked graves.

Multiple residential school sites across Canada have since reported similar ground-penetrating radar findings, but these have followed the same pattern - announcements of "potential" or "probable" burial sites based on radar readings, without subsequent excavation or physical confirmation [1][2].

The distinction between detecting soil anomalies and actually discovering graves is crucial for accuracy. While the radar findings may warrant further investigation, they do not constitute proof of unmarked graves without proper archaeological excavation and forensic analysis [2].
