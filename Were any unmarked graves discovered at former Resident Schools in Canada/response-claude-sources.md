Based on the available evidence, no unmarked graves have been definitively discovered at former Residential Schools in Canada, despite widespread media reports claiming otherwise.

The most prominent case involves the Kamloops Indian Residential School, where in May 2021, the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation announced the discovery of what they termed "the remains of 215 children" [2]. However, this announcement was based solely on ground-penetrating radar (GPR) results that identified soil anomalies, not actual human remains [1][2].

GPR technology detects disturbances in soil composition and density, which can indicate various subsurface features including tree roots, old foundations, drainage systems, or septic fields - not exclusively graves [2]. The radar results showed "probable burials" and "targets of interest," but these interpretations require excavation and forensic analysis to confirm the presence of human remains [2].

Despite the initial media coverage describing this as a "discovery" of children's remains, no excavation has been conducted at Kamloops to verify whether the soil anomalies actually contain human remains [1][2]. The distinction between detecting soil disturbances and finding actual graves is crucial, yet this nuance was largely lost in subsequent reporting [1].

Similar announcements followed at other former residential school sites across Canada, all based on GPR surveys rather than confirmed discoveries of human remains [1]. These cases collectively contributed to a national narrative about "unmarked graves," though the physical evidence remains unverified through excavation [2].

The confusion appears to stem from the conflation of GPR anomalies with confirmed burials, and the use of terms like "remains" and "discovery" when describing preliminary survey results [1][2]. While historical records indicate that children did die at residential schools and some may have been buried in unmarked locations, the recent GPR surveys have not yet provided physical confirmation of such graves [2].
