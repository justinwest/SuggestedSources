Yes, evidence of a significant number of potential unmarked graves has been identified at the sites of former residential schools in Canada. These findings primarily come from the use of ground-penetrating radar (GPR), which detects anomalies in the soil consistent with burials [2, 3]. However, there is significant debate surrounding the language used to describe these findings, specifically the distinction between a "potential grave" and a physically confirmed one [1, 2].

In May 2021, the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation announced the discovery of approximately 200 potential unmarked graves at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School, identified through a GPR survey [2, 5]. This announcement brought global attention to the issue. The GPR specialist who conducted the survey, Dr. Sarah Beaulieu, clarified that the radar signals showed "targets of interest" with characteristics of burials, but stated that "only excavation would confirm" the presence of human remains [2].

Critics, such as those writing in the *Dorchester Review* and on Chris Bray's Substack, argue that media outlets and politicians mischaracterized these findings as the discovery of "mass graves" or confirmed bodies, when no exhumation has taken place [1, 2]. These sources contend that the narrative created a "moral panic" based on unproven claims, highlighting that many of these sites were known, albeit neglected, cemeteries [1].

The GPR survey report from the former Mohawk Institute in Brantford, one of the provided sources, illustrates the scientific process. The investigation identified a known historic cemetery area and found numerous GPR anomalies "interpreted as potential unmarked graves" [3]. This report, like others, is cautious in its language, recommending further investigation rather than making definitive claims about discovered remains [3]. Since the 2021 Kamloops announcement, numerous other First Nations across Canada have undertaken similar investigations and reported finding thousands of additional potential unmarked graves [4, 6].

The existence of unmarked graves at residential schools is not a new revelation. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC), in its 2015 final report, dedicated an entire volume to "Missing Children and Unmarked Burials." The TRC identified over 3,200 deaths of children at residential schools and concluded that officials often failed to record the names of the deceased or the locations of their graves [4]. The TRC documented that children were commonly buried in school cemeteries and that these graves were often left unmarked, a fact long shared in the oral histories of Indigenous survivors and their communities [4, 5].

For many Indigenous communities, the GPR findings serve as a modern validation of this long-held knowledge and testimony. The decision to exhume remains is a sensitive and complex one for each community, which must weigh the desire for forensic confirmation against the spiritual and emotional trauma of disturbing ancestral burial sites [5, 6].

In summary, while physical exhumations have not been widely carried out to confirm the GPR findings, the radar surveys have identified thousands of probable unmarked graves. These discoveries align with and provide further evidence for the historical records and survivor testimonies documented by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which had already established that thousands of Indigenous children died and were buried in unmarked graves at residential schools in Canada [4].
