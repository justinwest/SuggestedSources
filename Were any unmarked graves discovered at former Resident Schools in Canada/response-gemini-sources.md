Based on the provided sources and additional research, the answer to whether unmarked graves were discovered at former residential schools in Canada is complex. The term "discovery" and the nature of the evidence are central to the public and scholarly debate on the issue.

Yes, there is significant evidence pointing to the existence of thousands of unmarked graves at former residential school sites, but the method of identification has been a point of contention. The "discoveries" that gained international attention in 2021 were primarily based on anomalies identified through ground-penetrating radar (GPR), not through the exhumation of human remains [1, 2, 3].

In May 2021, the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation announced the detection of 215 "potential burial sites" on the grounds of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School [3]. This was followed by similar announcements from numerous other First Nations across Canada who conducted their own GPR surveys, identifying thousands more potential unmarked graves [4].

The provided sources, from Chris Bray and the *Dorchester Review*, challenge the narrative that emerged from these announcements. They argue that what was "discovered" were soil disturbances or anomalies consistent with burials, but not confirmed graves containing human remains [1, 2]. Both authors criticize media outlets and public figures for using terms like "mass grave" and for stating that "bodies" were found, which they contend is an exaggeration not supported by physical evidence. They emphasize that GPR results are not definitive and require excavation for confirmation, and they suggest that many of these sites are likely known but poorly maintained cemeteries rather than clandestine mass burial grounds [1, 2].

However, the historical context provided by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC) is crucial. Long before the GPR surveys, the TRC's final report in 2015 identified 3,200 deaths of children at residential schools and stated that poor record-keeping and burial practices meant the true number was likely much higher [5]. The TRC’s “Missing Children and Unmarked Burials” volume detailed how children who died at the schools were often buried in school or church cemeteries that were frequently neglected, poorly marked, and eventually forgotten or built over [5].

While many First Nations have chosen not to disturb the potential grave sites for cultural and spiritual reasons, some excavations have taken place and have confirmed the presence of human remains. For example, forensic archaeological work at the former Brandon Residential School in Manitoba, which began before the 2021 announcements, has confirmed the presence of multiple unmarked graves containing the remains of children [6].

In summary, the situation is as follows:
*   The TRC historically confirmed that thousands of Indigenous children died at residential schools and were often buried in unmarked graves [5].
*   Since 2021, GPR surveys have identified thousands of *potential* unmarked graves at numerous former school sites [3, 4].
*   Critics, including the authors of the provided sources, argue that GPR anomalies are not proof of graves and that the language used by the media created a misleading narrative [1, 2].
*   Some excavations have confirmed human remains, but many communities have not excavated the sites identified by GPR, treating them as sacred burial grounds that should not be disturbed [6, 4].

Therefore, while the "discovery" of physical remains through mass excavation has not occurred in most cases, the convergence of GPR findings, survivor testimony, and the historical record from the TRC has led Indigenous communities and the Canadian government to operate on the basis that these sites do contain the unmarked graves of children who died at the schools [4, 5].
