Yes, numerous unmarked graves have been discovered at the sites of former residential schools in Canada. These discoveries, which began gaining significant international attention in 2021, have confirmed the oral testimonies of Indigenous Survivors and communities that have spoken for decades about the children who died at these institutions and were never returned to their families [1].

The process of locating these graves primarily uses non-invasive technologies like ground-penetrating radar (GPR), which detects anomalies or disturbances in the soil consistent with burials. This work is led by First Nations, often in collaboration with archaeologists and other technical experts.

### Context: The Truth and Reconciliation Commission

The groundwork for these discoveries was laid by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC), which operated from 2008 to 2015. In its final report, the TRC detailed the harsh conditions, abuse, and high death rates at the schools. The Commission identified 3,200 deaths of children in its records but stated that the true number was likely much higher due to poor record-keeping by both the churches that ran the schools and the federal government [2]. The TRC’s final report included six "Calls to Action" (numbers 71 through 76) specifically addressing missing children and burial information, urging the federal government to fund and support the work of locating and commemorating these children [2].

### Key Discoveries

While Indigenous communities have long held the knowledge of these burials, the use of GPR has provided preliminary physical evidence. Some of the most prominent discoveries include:

1.  **Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation (Kamloops, British Columbia):** In May 2021, the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc Nation announced the discovery of as many as 215 potential burial sites on the grounds of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School. This announcement was a pivotal moment that brought widespread public attention to the issue and prompted many other First Nations to initiate their own searches [3].

2.  **Cowessess First Nation (Marieval, Saskatchewan):** In June 2021, the Cowessess First Nation announced the discovery of an estimated 751 unmarked graves at the former Marieval Indian Residential School. Community knowledge holders stated that a cemetery had long existed there, but the headstones had been deliberately removed by Catholic Church representatives in the 1960s [4].

3.  **Kapawe'no First Nation (Grouard, Alberta):** In March 2022, a GPR search identified 169 potential graves at the site of the former St. Bernard Mission, also known as the Grouard Indian Residential School. The search was initiated based on the testimony of Survivors [5].

4.  **Williams Lake First Nation (Williams Lake, British Columbia):** In January 2022, this First Nation announced the discovery of 93 potential burial sites at the former St. Joseph’s Mission Residential School. Survivors had described horrific abuse at this institution, referring to it as a "torture chamber" [6].

These are just a few examples among dozens of other communities across Canada that have conducted or are in the process of conducting similar searches, with many also reporting the discovery of potential unmarked graves [1].

### The Nature of the Discoveries

It is important to be precise about the terminology used. Ground-penetrating radar identifies "anomalies" or "reflections" in the soil that are consistent with the presence of a grave shaft. While GPR is a highly reliable tool for this purpose, it does not confirm the presence of human remains. Forensic excavation is the only way to confirm this, but this step is complex and fraught with legal, cultural, and emotional challenges. Each First Nation is leading the decision-making process for its own territory, and many are prioritizing the gathering of information and commemoration before considering any exhumation [3, 4].

The discoveries have validated the long-ignored accounts of Survivors and have been a profound source of grief and trauma for Indigenous communities. They have also prompted a national reckoning in Canada, leading to a Papal apology for the Catholic Church's role in the residential school system and increased government funding for further searches and support for Survivors [7].
