Yes, potential unmarked graves have been discovered at numerous former residential school sites across Canada. Beginning in May 2021, First Nations using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and other remote-sensing technologies began announcing the identification of suspected gravesites, confirming the long-held testimonies of school survivors and community members who had spoken for decades about children who died or disappeared while at the schools and were buried in unmarked graves [1].

These announcements have brought renewed national and international attention to the devastating legacy of the Canadian Indian residential school system, which operated from the 1870s to the late 1990s.

### Key Discoveries

The recent findings are not isolated incidents but part of a widespread pattern. Some of the most significant announcements include:

*   **Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation (Kamloops, British Columbia):** In May 2021, the Nation announced the discovery of 215 potential graves on the grounds of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School, later revising the number to 200 "targets of interest" following more detailed analysis. This was the first major announcement that catalyzed a national reckoning and spurred many other First Nations to begin their own searches [1].
*   **Cowessess First Nation (Marieval, Saskatchewan):** In June 2021, the Cowessess First Nation announced the discovery of an estimated 751 unmarked graves at the former Marieval Indian Residential School. The community noted that headstones had once marked some of the graves but were deliberately removed by representatives of the Catholic Church in the 1960s. This site is believed to contain the remains of both children from the school and adult community members [2].
*   **ʔaq̓am (Cranbrook, British Columbia):** In June 2021, the Lower Kootenay Band, a member of the Ktunaxa Nation, announced the identification of 182 unmarked graves in a cemetery adjacent to the former St. Eugene’s Mission School [3].
*   **Penelakut Tribe (Kuper Island, British Columbia):** In July 2021, the Penelakut Tribe announced that more than 160 undocumented and unmarked graves had been found on the grounds of the former Kuper Island Industrial School, a site known for its particularly high death rate and history of abuse [4].

Numerous other First Nations across the country have since announced similar findings at the sites of former schools, including in Manitoba, Alberta, and Ontario. The number of potential graves identified continues to grow as more communities undertake searches of former school grounds.

### Context and Nuance

It is crucial to understand several key points regarding these discoveries:

1.  **Confirmation, Not Discovery:** For many Indigenous communities and survivors, these are not "discoveries" but rather confirmations of knowledge and oral histories passed down through generations. Survivors had long spoken of secret burials, neglected cemeteries, and children who vanished without a trace, but their accounts were often dismissed by government and church authorities [1].
2.  **The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC):** The TRC’s 2015 final report dedicated an entire volume to "Missing Children and Unmarked Burials." The commission identified high death rates in the schools due to disease (particularly tuberculosis), malnutrition, neglect, and abuse. The TRC officially documented the deaths of 3,201 children by name, but due to poor record-keeping, it estimated the actual number could be 6,000 or higher. The report included 6 Calls to Action (71-76) specifically related to finding and commemorating these children [5].
3.  **Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR):** The technology being used, GPR, does not "see" human remains. Instead, it detects anomalies or disturbances in the soil consistent with the digging of a grave shaft. While it provides strong evidence of potential gravesites, forensic investigation and excavation would be required for definitive confirmation. Many communities are carefully deliberating on whether to proceed with excavation due to the sacred and sensitive nature of these sites [6].
4.  **Unmarked vs. Mass Graves:** The sites are generally referred to as "unmarked graves" rather than "mass graves." A mass grave typically refers to a single pit containing multiple bodies, often from a single event. The residential school sites generally consist of numerous individual, unmarked burial plots, though the specific arrangement varies by location. In some cases, these were once part of known cemeteries where markers were lost to time, neglect, or deliberate removal [2].

In summary, the use of modern technology has confirmed the existence of a significant number of potential unmarked graves at former residential school sites across Canada. These findings validate the testimonies of survivors and expose the deadly reality of a system designed to forcibly assimilate Indigenous children, the full scale of which is still being uncovered.
