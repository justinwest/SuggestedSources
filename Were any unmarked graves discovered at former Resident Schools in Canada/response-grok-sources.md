The discovery of unmarked graves at former residential schools in Canada has been a significant and sensitive topic, particularly following announcements starting in 2021. These schools, operated primarily by the Canadian government and churches from the late 19th century until the late 20th century, were part of a system that forcibly assimilated Indigenous children, resulting in documented deaths from disease, abuse, neglect, and other causes [3]. The question of whether unmarked graves have been "discovered" depends on the definition of "discovery": it could refer to the identification of potential grave sites through non-invasive methods like ground-penetrating radar (GPR), or to the physical excavation and confirmation of human remains. Based on available evidence, suspected unmarked graves have been identified at multiple sites using GPR and other technologies, but physical excavations confirming human remains have been rare, often due to Indigenous communities' decisions not to disturb potential burial sites out of respect for cultural and spiritual protocols [4]. Below, I provide a detailed analysis, drawing on the provided sources and additional reliable ones for accuracy.

### Key Cases and Findings
The most prominent case began in May 2021, when the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation announced the detection of 215 "anomalies" consistent with unmarked graves at the site of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia, using GPR [1][2]. This was not a discovery of physical remains but rather soil disturbances that could indicate graves; however, no excavations have occurred at the site to date, and the anomalies could potentially be explained by other factors, such as tree roots, old building foundations, or septic fields [1][2]. Both provided sources emphasize that, two years later, no human remains have been confirmed at Kamloops, describing the initial media and public narrative as overstated or misleading [1][2]. The Dorchester Review fact-check notes that historical records already indicated the presence of a cemetery at the school, but markers had been lost or removed over time [2].

Similar GPR-based announcements followed at other former residential school sites across Canada:
- In June 2021, the Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan reported 751 potential unmarked graves at the former Marieval Indian Residential School. This was based on GPR surveys of a known community cemetery where grave markers (often wooden) had deteriorated or been removed [4][5]. No excavations were conducted, and the site was described as a historical cemetery rather than a new "mass grave" discovery [5].
- In July 2021, the Penelakut Tribe in British Columbia identified over 160 potential unmarked graves at the former Kuper Island Residential School using GPR [4].
- Other sites, such as the former Brandon Residential School in Manitoba (93 potential graves announced in 2022) and the former St. Joseph's Mission Residential School near Williams Lake, British Columbia (159 potential graves announced in 2022), also relied on GPR and geophysical surveys without excavation [4][6].

In most of these cases, the "discoveries" refer to the re-identification of forgotten or unmarked burial grounds that were already documented in historical records, such as those from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) of Canada, which estimated over 4,100 Indigenous children died at residential schools, many buried in school cemeteries [3]. The TRC's 2015 report highlighted that many graves were unmarked due to poor record-keeping, cemetery abandonment, or deliberate removal of markers [3].

### Have Physical Remains Been Discovered?
While GPR has identified hundreds of potential sites, physical excavations confirming unmarked graves with human remains have been limited and not widespread. One notable exception occurred in 2022 at the former Pine Creek Residential School site in Manitoba, where the Minegoziibe Anishinabe First Nation conducted limited excavations and confirmed human remains in at least 14 unmarked graves [7]. These were part of a known cemetery, and the excavation was done with community consent to verify GPR findings [7]. Another case involved the Star Blanket Cree Nation in Saskatchewan, which in 2023 announced the discovery of one child's remains during an excavation prompted by GPR anomalies at the former Lebret (Qu'Appelle) Residential School site [8]. However, these are outliers; many First Nations have chosen not to excavate, prioritizing healing, ceremony, and avoiding further trauma [4][6]. As a result, the total number of confirmed unmarked graves with exhumed remains remains small compared to the thousands of potential sites identified [3][4].

Critics, including the authors of the provided sources, argue that the narrative of "unmarked graves" has been sensationalized, with media often conflating GPR anomalies with confirmed bodies or implying clandestine "mass graves" without evidence [1][2]. They point out that no evidence of criminal concealment has been found, and many sites were simply neglected cemeteries [1][2]. Conversely, Indigenous leaders and the Canadian government have treated these findings as evidence of the residential school system's harms, leading to national mourning, funding for further searches, and calls for accountability [3][4].

### Broader Context and Ongoing Investigations
The residential school system is estimated to have involved over 150,000 Indigenous children, with the TRC documenting at least 3,200 deaths, though the true number may be higher due to incomplete records [3]. In response to the 2021 announcements, the Canadian government allocated $320 million for searches and memorials, and as of 2023, over 2,000 potential unmarked graves have been identified across dozens of sites via GPR [4][6]. Investigations continue, but they are community-led and proceed at a pace respectful of Indigenous protocols [4].

In summary, while no unmarked graves with confirmed human remains have been physically discovered at high-profile sites like Kamloops, suspected unmarked graves have been identified through GPR at numerous former residential schools. Limited excavations at a few other sites have confirmed some remains, supporting historical accounts of deaths and burials. The issue remains unresolved and deeply tied to Canada's reconciliation efforts with Indigenous peoples.
