The question of whether unmarked graves have been discovered at former residential schools in Canada (noting that "Resident Schools" appears to be a reference to the Canadian Indian residential school system) is complex and tied to both historical records and recent investigations. The residential school system, which operated from the 1870s to the 1990s, forcibly assimilated Indigenous children, resulting in documented deaths from disease, abuse, neglect, and other causes. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC), established in 2008, estimated that at least 4,100 children died while attending these schools, with many buried in unmarked or poorly documented graves on or near school grounds [4]. However, the term "discovered" in recent contexts often refers to announcements since 2021 about potential graves identified through ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and other non-invasive surveys, rather than physical excavations confirming human remains.

### Historical Context and Confirmed Unmarked Graves
Historically, unmarked graves associated with residential schools have indeed been documented and, in some cases, physically located or excavated prior to the recent wave of investigations. The TRC's 2015 report highlighted that many school cemeteries were abandoned, overgrown, or built over, leading to lost records and unmarked burials [4]. For example:
- At the Regina Indian Industrial School in Saskatchewan, historical records and excavations in the 20th century confirmed unmarked graves of students who died at the school [5].
- In other cases, such as the Muskowpetung First Nation's efforts in the early 2000s, community-led searches identified and marked previously unmarked graves linked to nearby residential schools [4].

These instances rely on archival evidence, oral histories, and some physical confirmations, but they predate the 2021 announcements and were not based on widespread GPR use.

### Recent Investigations (2021 Onward)
Starting in May 2021, several Indigenous communities announced findings of potential unmarked graves at former residential school sites using GPR, which detects soil disturbances that could indicate burials. These announcements sparked national and international attention, leading to mourning, calls for reconciliation, and debates over terminology. However, as of October 2023, no physical excavations have occurred at these sites to confirm the presence of human remains, and experts emphasize that GPR identifies anomalies (e.g., disrupted soil) rather than definitively proving graves or bodies [1][2][6].

Key examples include:
- **Kamloops Indian Residential School (British Columbia)**: The Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation reported 215 potential graves based on GPR surveys of an orchard near the school. Initial media reports described these as "unmarked graves" of children, but no excavations have been conducted, and the findings remain preliminary anomalies. Community leaders have stated that exhumation is not currently planned due to cultural sensitivities and the need for further consultation [2][6].
- **Marieval Indian Residential School (Saskatchewan)**: The Cowessess First Nation announced 751 potential unmarked graves in June 2021 via GPR at a cemetery site. Some graves were previously marked but had markers removed over time. Again, no excavations have confirmed human remains in recent discoveries [2][7].
- **St. Joseph's Mission Residential School (British Columbia)**: In 2022, the Williams Lake First Nation reported 93 potential graves via GPR, but these are unconfirmed without excavation [2].
- Other sites, such as those near the former Brandon Residential School (Manitoba) and Shubenacadie Residential School (Nova Scotia), have similar GPR-based announcements of anomalies, totaling over 2,000 potential sites across Canada [7]. No human remains have been exhumed in these cases.

Critics, including some historians and journalists, argue that the narrative of "discovered unmarked graves" has been overstated, as no bodies have been found, and some sites (e.g., Kamloops) may include known adult burials or non-grave disturbances [1][2]. Proponents, including Indigenous leaders and the Canadian government, view these as important steps in acknowledging historical truths, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau allocating $320 million in 2021 for searches and memorials [6][8].

### Other Relevant Discoveries
One provided source discusses a non-residential school context: a 2021 GPR survey of the Hamilton Municipal Cemeteries in Ontario identified potential unmarked graves in a historical cemetery, but this is unrelated to residential schools and pertains to general urban cemetery management [3]. It does not address the question directly.

In summary, while historical records and some pre-2021 efforts have confirmed the existence of unmarked graves at residential schools through documentation and limited excavations, the recent high-profile "discoveries" are based on GPR anomalies suggesting possible graves, without physical confirmation of human remains. Ongoing investigations may lead to future excavations, but cultural, ethical, and logistical considerations have delayed them [4][6]. The absence of exhumations means that, strictly speaking, no new unmarked graves with confirmed human remains have been "discovered" in the physical sense since 2021, though the potential sites represent a significant acknowledgment of residential school harms.
