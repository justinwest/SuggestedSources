There is no single, universally accepted definition of "race." The concept is complex and highly contested, with major perspectives framing it as either a social construct, a biological reality, or a combination of both [3, 4].

The dominant view in the social sciences for several decades has been that race is a social construct [1]. According to this perspective, racial categories are not based on distinct, naturally occurring biological divisions within the human species. Instead, they are ideas created by societies to categorize people, often to establish and maintain power hierarchies. These categories are fluid, changing across different times and cultures, and their meanings are shaped by social and political forces [1, 5]. From this viewpoint, it is racism that creates and gives meaning to race, not the other way around. The international effort by organizations like UNESCO after World War II to redefine race was a deliberate attempt to dismantle the scientific justifications for racism by emphasizing its social and political nature [5].

A contrasting perspective, often termed "race realism," argues that races are real, biological categories that correspond to major continental ancestry groups [3, 6]. Proponents of this view state that while human genetic variation is continuous, human populations that were geographically separated for long periods evolved average differences in traits and gene frequencies [6]. They argue that these differences are significant and can be used to reliably classify individuals into groups that align with common racial categories [3, 9]. A key argument supporting this view is the statistical critique of Richard Lewontin’s famous claim that race has no biological basis. While Lewontin correctly noted that most genetic variation exists *within* populations rather than *between* them, critics like A.W.F. Edwards point out this is a "fallacy" that ignores how the correlation of allele frequencies allows for highly accurate classification of an individual's continental ancestry [9]. Nicholas Wade extends this, arguing that these continental races are biological realities that have continued to evolve separately [6].

The modern scientific debate attempts to reconcile these views, acknowledging elements of truth in both. Many geneticists, like David Reich, agree that the old "folk" categories of race are scientifically imprecise and socially loaded, but they also argue that it is undeniable that there are real, average genetic differences among human populations that correlate with these old categories [2]. These geneticists often prefer the term "ancestry" to "race" to avoid the historical baggage, but they caution against denying the existence of these population-level biological differences, as they can have important implications, particularly in medicine [2, 4].

Recent technological advances have further complicated the debate. For example, a 2022 study in *The Lancet Digital Health* found that artificial intelligence models could predict a patient's self-reported race with over 90% accuracy from medical images like X-rays and CT scans alone, even when human radiologists could not [7]. The researchers could not identify the specific variables the AI was using, but the finding suggests a deep biological signal that correlates strongly with socially defined racial categories, challenging the idea that race is *purely* a social construct with no physical basis [7].

Historically, the concept of "race" is a product of the modern era, emerging in the 18th century as naturalists like Buffon sought to classify and explain human diversity based on physical characteristics and geographic origins [8]. This scientific origin was later co-opted for political and social purposes. Some scholars now argue that the intense social and political debate has led to a "social destruction of a biological concept," where the legitimate biological study of human population diversity has been unfairly conflated with outdated and harmful racist ideologies [10].

In summary, "race" can be understood as a social construct used to categorize people, but this social construct maps, albeit imperfectly, onto real patterns of human genetic diversity shaped by ancestral geography [2, 4]. The ongoing debate centers on the significance of this biological correlation and the language used to describe it.

    This source presents the social-psychological perspective, arguing that race is a social construct. It posits that racial categories are created by societies to organize people and often to create and enforce social hierarchies. The authors assert that it is racism that gives meaning to race, not the other way around.

    Geneticist David Reich argues that while "race" is a social construct, there are real, average genetic differences among human populations that we should not ignore. He advocates for using terms like "ancestry" to discuss these differences to avoid resurrecting old racist typologies while still acknowledging biological reality.
