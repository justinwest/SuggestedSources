The definition of race is complex and highly contested, with perspectives ranging from the view that it is a social construct to the view that it is a biological reality [4]. The contemporary understanding of race often involves a synthesis of these ideas, acknowledging both its social dimensions and its relationship to human biological variation [2].

### Race as a Social Construct

The most widely accepted view in the social sciences is that race is a social construct [1]. According to this perspective, race is a system of categorization created by societies to sort people into groups based on perceived physical traits, such as skin color, or shared ancestry. These categories are not natural or biologically fixed but are defined differently across various cultures and historical periods [1, 5].

Historically, the concept of race was developed to create and enforce social hierarchies. Racial classifications have been used to justify discrimination, colonialism, and violence by attributing inherent, often negative, qualities to different groups [1]. After World War II, international organizations like UNESCO actively worked to discredit the biological concept of race, promoting the view that it was a social myth responsible for profound harm [5]. Proponents of the social construct view argue that the changing definitions of race over time—for example, how groups like the Irish or Italians were once considered non-white in the U.S. but now are—demonstrate that it is a fluid social idea, not a rigid biological fact [1].

### The Debate on Biology and Genetics

While human genetic variation is continuous and most genetic differences exist within populations rather than between them, some scientists argue that there is a biological basis for the broad groupings commonly referred to as races [2, 6, 9].

A foundational argument against the biology of race came from geneticist Richard Lewontin in 1972. He found that approximately 85% of human genetic variation is found within any single population (e.g., within the French), about 9% is found between populations within a continent (e.g., between the French and the Italians), and only the remaining 6% is found between large, continental groups (e.g., between "Europeans" and "Asians") [9]. This was widely interpreted to mean that race has no biological or genetic reality [4].

However, other scientists later challenged this conclusion in what is known as "Lewontin's Fallacy" [9]. A.W.F. Edwards argued that while single genes show little differentiation between populations, the correlation between the frequencies of many different genes allows for highly accurate classification of individuals into their ancestral continental groups [6, 9]. Modern genomics confirms that populations that have been geographically separated for long periods, such as those from West Africa, Western Eurasia, and East Asia, are genetically distinguishable [2, 6]. Some who argue for "race realism" contend that these ancestral population clusters are what people commonly mean by "race" and that they are therefore biologically meaningful categories [3].

### Synthesizing Social and Biological Views

Many contemporary thinkers attempt to bridge the social and biological perspectives. They acknowledge that while race as a social hierarchy is a human invention, the categories themselves are often mapped onto real, observable patterns of human ancestry and genetic variation [2, 10].

*   **A Social Construct Based on Biological Cues**: Some scholars describe race as a "social destruction of a biological concept" [10]. This view suggests that the idea of distinct human populations with shared ancestry is biologically valid, but this concept was co-opted and distorted by social and political forces to create the rigid, hierarchical racial systems we know today [10].
*   **Medical and Scientific Relevance**: Geneticist David Reich argues that it is necessary to acknowledge average genetic differences between populations for medical research, such as understanding disease risk, while simultaneously rejecting racist beliefs [2]. A 2022 study in *The Lancet* found that artificial intelligence models could predict a patient's self-reported race from medical images like X-rays with high accuracy, even when human radiologists could not. This suggests that there are biological correlates to race beyond superficial traits like skin color, though the nature of these correlates remains unknown [7].
*   **Historical Origins**: The scientific term "race" emerged in the 18th century through the work of naturalists like Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, who sought to classify human diversity as a part of the natural world. This historical origin highlights the concept's roots in the scientific observation of human physical differences, which was later used to build social hierarchies [8].

In conclusion, race can be understood as a social construct that uses perceived biological and ancestral differences to categorize people into distinct groups. These social categories have been used to create and maintain power imbalances and inequality [1]. At the same time, modern genetics shows that there are average, statistically significant biological differences among ancestral population groups that roughly correspond to traditional racial classifications. The ongoing debate centers on how to understand the relationship between these biological patterns and the social realities of race and racism [2, 4].
