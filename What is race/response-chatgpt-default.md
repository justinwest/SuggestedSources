Race is a way societies classify people into broad groups based on perceived physical traits (such as skin color, hair texture, facial features) and presumed ancestry. Most contemporary scholarship agrees that, in humans, race is not a biologically discrete or natural subdivision of our species; rather, it is a social construct that varies across time and place but has powerful, material consequences because institutions and everyday practices allocate resources, rights, and risk along racial lines [1][2][5][12].

What modern biology and genetics say
- Human genetic variation is largely continuous (clinal) across geography, not neatly partitioned into distinct “races.” When sampling is geographically even, variation forms gradients rather than sharp boundaries [11]. Most genetic diversity is found within any given population rather than between populations [4].
- Statistical methods can detect population structure and often recover clusters roughly corresponding to geography or continental ancestry because of migration history and partial isolation [3]. This does not mean there are discrete biological races; rather, it reflects patterns of relatedness and gene flow among populations [2][3][11].
- Race categories are inconsistent across societies and are poor proxies for an individual’s genotype or specific biological traits. Where biological inference is needed, ancestry (inferred from genetic data or well-documented genealogies) or direct measurement of relevant environmental and social exposures is more appropriate than race labels [2][10].
- Major scientific bodies (biological anthropology, genetics, and medicine) explicitly reject the idea that human “races” are biologically fixed or essential categories, while recognizing that racism produces real biological and health effects through lived experience and structural conditions [1][2][5].

Social and historical dimensions
- Modern racial classification emerged alongside European colonialism and slavery, and was reinforced by now-discredited scientific typologies that treated social hierarchies as natural facts. In the mid-20th century, international scientific statements (e.g., UNESCO) repudiated biological racism and emphasized the shared humanity and overlapping variation among populations [7].
- Social scientists characterize race as a historically contingent set of categories maintained through law, policy, culture, and everyday practice; its meanings and boundaries shift over time (for example, how “White,” “Black,” or “Asian” have been defined in different countries/eras) [5][12].

Law, policy, and official statistics
- Governments use race (and ethnicity) categories for civil rights enforcement, monitoring inequality, and research. In the United States, the federal standards that guide how agencies collect race and ethnicity data were revised in 2024 to use a single combined question, to add a Middle Eastern or North African category, and to encourage more detailed reporting—illustrating that official categories are administrative tools, not biological truths [6].

Consequences and why race still matters
- Although biologically invalid as essential types, race categories shape exposure to opportunities and harms, including housing, education, employment, policing, environmental risk, and health care. Major health organizations and public-health agencies identify racism as a fundamental driver of health inequities [2][9].
- Medicine and public health increasingly avoid using race as a proxy for biology. For example, the U.S. kidney function equation removed a “race correction” and now estimates glomerular filtration rate without race, improving equity and accuracy [8]. Guidance from the National Academies recommends using precise descriptors (genetic ancestry, environmental exposures, structural factors) rather than race when studying biological mechanisms, and reserving race for analyzing racism and inequity [2].

How race differs from related terms
- Ethnicity: usually refers to cultural affiliation (language, customs, shared history). People who identify as the same race may belong to different ethnic groups, and vice versa [2][12].
- Ancestry: biogeographic origins inferred from genealogical or genetic data; more informative than race for biological questions, though it too is probabilistic and context-dependent [2][10].
- Nationality/citizenship: legal membership in a nation-state; not the same as race or ethnicity.

Key takeaways
- Humans do not sort into discrete biological races; human genetic variation is patterned but continuous and overlapping [1][3][4][11].
- Race is a socially constructed system of classification that changes across contexts yet has real effects because societies and institutions make it consequential [2][5][9][12].
- In research, policy, and care, use race thoughtfully: to study and address racism and inequality; avoid treating race as a biological cause. Use ancestry, specific exposures, and structural measures when investigating mechanisms [2][10].
