Short answer
Race is a social classification system that societies use to sort people into broad groups based on perceived ancestry and visible traits. It is socially real and consequential, but it is not a precise biological taxonomy. Human genetic variation is structured by geography and history, forming overlapping, fuzzy clusters and clines; these patterns only imperfectly align with everyday racial labels and are better described in terms of ancestry and populations than “races.” [1][2][9][10][12]

A fuller answer
- What race is (and isn’t)
  - Social category: In everyday life and law, race is a socially constructed label tied to history, power, and institutions. It shapes identity, opportunity, discrimination, and health via social mechanisms; in this sense race is very real in its effects. [1][5]
  - Not a biological subspecies: Humans do not sort into a few discrete, natural biological “races.” Most genetic variation is found within populations; between-population differences exist, but boundaries are gradual (clinal), overlapping, and depend on which groups and markers you sample. [9][10][12]

- How we got here (brief history)
  - Early naturalists such as Buffon helped forge the race concept in the 18th century, shifting from “types” to genealogies but still seeking broad, essentialized human groupings. [8]
  - After WWII, UNESCO-led statements emphasized that “race” lacked clear biological foundations and urged a shift toward culture, history, and shared humanity, shaping today’s social-science usage. [5]

- What genetics actually shows
  - Structure without sharp edges: Using many genetic markers, statistical methods can recover clusters that often mirror geography/continental ancestry; this is compatible with the fact that most variation is within groups and that clusters blur at edges. [2][9][12]
  - Labels vs ancestry: Self-identified race correlates only coarsely with genetic ancestry and can misclassify individuals in admixed populations; ancestry (fine-grained population histories) is the better scientific variable. [2][12]
  - Polygenic scores and portability: Genetic predictors trained in one ancestry often perform worse in others, underscoring that continental labels are too crude for many biomedical uses. [11]
  - Medical context: Race sometimes tracks risk because of social exposures (racism, environment, access) more than genes. Alarmingly, AI can infer patient “race” from medical images even when clinicians cannot, showing that social patterning leaves biological traces—and raising equity and misuse concerns. [1][7]

- Why the debate persists
  - Proponents of “race realism” argue that genetic clustering plus some average group differences vindicate biological races. Critics respond that while population structure is real, it does not map cleanly onto folk racial categories or justify treating races as natural kinds; social categories are historically contingent, internally diverse, and context-dependent. [3][6][9][10][4][5][12]
  - Mainstream view across social psychology, philosophy of biology, and much of genomics: keep the term race for its social reality and for monitoring inequality, but use genetic ancestry/populations for biological inference, and avoid treating race as a biological essence. [1][4][5][10][12]

Practical takeaways
- For science and medicine: Prefer ancestry (and specific populations) over race; attend to social determinants; validate tools across ancestries to avoid inequities. [1][4][7][11]
- For law and policy: Race remains necessary to track discrimination and disparities—because the category is socially powerful—even though it is not a biological taxon. [1][5]
- For public understanding: You can acknowledge real genetic population structure without reifying race as biology. Race is best seen as a sociohistorical category that loosely, and often unreliably, proxies aspects of ancestry. [2][9][10][12]
