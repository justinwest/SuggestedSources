### Overview of Immigration Under the Biden Presidency

The question of how many immigrants "entered" the United States under President Joe Biden's administration (which began on January 20, 2021, and continues as of this response in October 2024) requires careful clarification. "Immigrants" can refer to individuals entering legally (e.g., via visas, green cards, or refugee status) or those entering without authorization (often tracked through border encounters, apprehensions, or estimates of undetected crossings). Official data distinguishes between these categories, and not all border encounters result in entryâ€”many individuals are turned away, expelled, or processed for removal [1].

Data is typically reported by fiscal year (FY), running from October 1 to September 30, so Biden's term covers parts of FY 2021 (starting mid-year) through FY 2024 (ongoing). Estimates vary by source due to methodological differences: government agencies like U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provide raw data on encounters and legal admissions, while think tanks and analysts offer interpretations, including estimates of "got-aways" (those who evade detection) [2][3]. Total figures are not static, as immigration is ongoing, and numbers can include repeat attempts by the same individuals.

This response breaks down the data into legal and unauthorized immigration, providing cumulative estimates from January 2021 to August 2024 (the latest comprehensive data available). These are based on official statistics and analyses, with caveats for accuracy.

### Legal Immigration
Legal immigration includes individuals granted lawful permanent residence (green cards), temporary visas (e.g., work, student, or visitor), refugees, asylees, and other authorized entries. Under Biden, legal pathways have expanded somewhat, including humanitarian parole programs for certain nationalities (e.g., Afghans, Ukrainians, Venezuelans, Haitians, Cubans, and Nicaraguans) [4].

- **Green Cards (Lawful Permanent Residents):** Approximately 3.5 million green cards were issued from FY 2021 to FY 2023, with FY 2024 projections adding about 1 million more, for a total of around 4.5 million [1][4]. This averages about 1 million per year, consistent with pre-Biden levels but with backlogs reduced post-COVID.
  
- **Refugees and Asylees:** About 250,000 refugees were admitted from FY 2021 to FY 2023, with FY 2024 on track for 100,000 more, totaling roughly 350,000 [4]. Asylum grants (for those already in the U.S.) numbered around 150,000 over the same period [1].

- **Humanitarian Parole and Other Programs:** Over 1 million individuals entered via parole programs, including approximately 500,000 through the CHNV (Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela) program and 400,000 Ukrainians and Afghans [4][5].

- **Total Legal Entries:** Cumulatively, legal immigrants entering or adjusting status under Biden total an estimated 6-7 million, including green cards, refugees, parolees, and temporary visa holders who may later adjust status [4]. This figure excludes short-term visitors but includes those who "enter" via ports of entry or adjustments.

These numbers reflect a rebound from pandemic lows, with Biden administration policies emphasizing family reunification and humanitarian relief [4].

### Unauthorized Immigration and Border Encounters
Unauthorized immigration is harder to quantify precisely, as it relies on encounters (apprehensions or processing at borders) and estimates of undetected entries. CBP tracks "encounters" at the southwest border, which include apprehensions, inadmissibles at ports, and expulsions (e.g., under Title 42 public health authority, used until May 2023) [2]. Not all encounters lead to entry; many result in immediate removal, though some are released into the U.S. pending asylum claims or other proceedings [3].

- **Southwest Border Encounters:** From January 2021 to August 2024, there were approximately 10.1 million encounters nationwide (primarily southwest border), including:
  - FY 2021 (partial): 1.7 million
  - FY 2022: 2.4 million
  - FY 2023: 2.5 million
  - FY 2024 (through August): 2.2 million (with September estimates adding ~200,000) [2][3].
  This is a record high, driven by global migration trends, economic factors, and policy changes [3].

- **Entries from Encounters:** Of these, an estimated 4-5 million were processed and allowed entry (e.g., released with notices to appear in court or paroled), while about 4 million were expelled or removed [2][6]. Title 42 expulsions accounted for over 2.5 million rapid returns until its end [2].

- **Got-Aways (Undetected Entries):** CBP estimates about 1.8 million individuals evaded detection and entered unauthorized from FY 2021 to FY 2023, with FY 2024 adding roughly 500,000, for a total of around 2.3 million [3][6]. These are extrapolations based on camera footage, sensors, and agent observations, and are subject to debate [6].

- **Total Unauthorized Entries:** Combining processed encounters that resulted in release and got-aways, estimates range from 5-7 million unauthorized immigrants entering under Biden [3][6]. Conservative analyses often cite higher figures (e.g., 10 million+ including all encounters), but these overcount by including expulsions and repeats [6]. A more moderate estimate from nonpartisan sources is about 6 million net unauthorized entries [3].

Factors influencing these numbers include Biden's reversal of some Trump-era restrictions (e.g., ending the "Remain in Mexico" policy), increased asylum seekers from regions like Venezuela and Haiti, and global events like the COVID-19 recovery [3][5].

### Overall Total and Caveats
Adding legal and unauthorized categories, a broad estimate of total immigrants entering the U.S. under Biden is 11-14 million from January 2021 to August 2024 [3][4][6]. This includes:
- 6-7 million legal.
- 5-7 million unauthorized.

However, this is not a precise "entry" count:
- Many legal immigrants adjust status while already in the U.S., not necessarily "entering" anew.
- Unauthorized figures include estimates, not exact counts, and net migration accounts for outflows (e.g., deportations: over 1.5 million under Biden) [1][2].
- Comparisons to prior administrations: Encounters were lower under Trump (e.g., 400,000-800,000 annually pre-COVID), but legal immigration was similar [3].
- Recent trends: Encounters dropped sharply in mid-2024 after Biden's June 2024 executive order restricting asylum, with August 2024 at ~58,000, the lowest in years [2].

These figures are debated politically: Progressive sources emphasize humanitarian needs and legal pathways [5], while conservative ones highlight border security failures [6]. For the most current data, consult CBP's monthly updates.
