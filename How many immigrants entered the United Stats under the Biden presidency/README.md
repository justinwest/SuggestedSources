# ü§ñ Claude's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

The number of immigrants who entered the United States during the Biden presidency varies significantly depending on how "immigrants" is defined and which data sources are used. The Biden administration, which began in January 2021, has overseen a complex period of immigration marked by both increased border encounters and expanded legal pathways.

## Border Encounters and Apprehensions

According to official data, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded approximately 7.8 million encounters at the southern border from February 2021 through September 2024 [1]. However, it's important to note that encounters do not equal unique individuals, as the same person can be encountered multiple times. The actual number of unique individuals is lower, though precise figures are disputed.

## Legal Immigration Pathways

The Biden administration has significantly expanded the use of humanitarian parole programs. According to analysis from the Center for Immigration Studies, the administration paroled nearly 3 million foreign nationals into the United States through various programs between January 2021 and early 2024 [2]. This includes approximately:

- 1.45 million individuals paroled at the southwest border
- 530,000 through the CBP One app program
- 357,000 Ukrainians through Uniting for Ukraine
- 477,000 through the CHNV program (Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela) [2]

## Total Immigration Numbers

The Migration Policy Institute notes that the Biden administration has presided over both record-high unauthorized border crossings and the expansion of legal pathways [3]. When combining various forms of entry, including:
- Legal permanent residents (green card holders)
- Temporary visa holders
- Parolees
- Asylum seekers
- Those who entered without authorization

The total number of immigrants who entered during the Biden presidency likely exceeds 10 million people, though exact figures depend on definitions and data sources [4][5].

## Important Context

Several factors complicate precise counting:
1. Many encounters at the border result in immediate expulsion or removal
2. Some individuals are counted multiple times in encounter statistics
3. Not all who enter remain in the United States
4. Different agencies and organizations use varying methodologies for counting

The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Immigration Statistics reported that fiscal year 2023 saw approximately 3.1 million total encounters, with about 2.5 million at the Southwest border [1]. However, these figures include repeat crossers and those who were immediately expelled.

# ü§ñ ChatGPT's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

Short answer: There is no single official count for ‚Äúhow many immigrants entered‚Äù because it depends on what you include. Under President Biden (since January 2021), CBP recorded roughly 10‚Äì11 million border encounters. The number who were allowed into and remain in the U.S. is much lower but still in the millions: congressional testimony and independent analyses put releases/parole into the U.S. in the range of about 3‚Äì5 million, plus roughly 2 million ‚Äúknown gotaways.‚Äù If you count only formal humanitarian parole programs, one prominent estimate argues ‚Äúnearly 3 million‚Äù were paroled, though that methodology is contested and may overstate by mixing distinct categories of parole and releases [1][2][3][4].

What the data show (and how to interpret it)
- Border encounters (not the same as entries or admissions): CBP reports more than 10 million encounters nationwide since the start of 2021; this figure includes repeat crossers and many people who were expelled or removed and thus did not remain in the U.S. [1][3][4].
- Known gotaways: Roughly 1.9‚Äì2.0 million people are estimated to have entered unlawfully without being apprehended during this period, based on DHS/CBP tallies cited in congressional testimony [1].
- Released into the U.S. interior pending proceedings: Multiple oversight and analytic sources put this figure in the low-to-mid millions since 2021 (on the order of 3‚Äì5 million), reflecting a mix of notices to appear/report, parole, and alternatives to detention. Precise totals vary by methodology and cut-off date [1][3].
- Humanitarian parole: One analysis argues the administration has ‚Äúparoled in nearly 3 million‚Äù people by early 2025, counting both programmatic parolees (e.g., Afghans, Ukrainians, and the CHNV processes) and parole used operationally at the border. Other experts caution that conflating programmatic parole with case-by-case border processing inflates the impression of ‚Äúparole admissions‚Äù as a distinct pathway [2][3].
- Lawful permanent immigration (green cards): Separate from the border situation, the U.S. has continued to grant roughly 1 million lawful permanent resident statuses per year (many to people already inside the U.S. adjusting status). These are ‚Äúimmigrants‚Äù in the legal sense but are not typically what people mean when asking about border entries. Official DHS yearbooks provide the exact annual counts by fiscal year [3].

Why estimates differ
- ‚ÄúEncounter‚Äù does not equal ‚Äúentered‚Äù or ‚Äústayed.‚Äù Many encountered individuals were expelled under Title 42 (in 2021‚Äì2023) or removed; others tried multiple times, so totals include duplicates [3][4].
- Releases vs. parole: DHS uses several legal authorities (e.g., notices to appear/report, parole under INA 212(d)(5)). Some estimates combine these; others count only programmatic parole (e.g., Ukrainians, Afghans, CHNV) [2][3].
- Gotaways are estimates. They are tracked operationally and come with uncertainty; including or excluding them changes the ‚Äúentered‚Äù total materially [1].

Bottom line
- If by ‚Äúentered‚Äù you mean all border encounters, the number is about 10‚Äì11 million since January 2021 [1][3][4].
- If you mean people allowed into the country and not immediately removed (releases plus parole), a reasonable order-of-magnitude estimate is roughly 3‚Äì5 million through early 2025, with methodology-dependent uncertainty [1][3].
- If you add known gotaways to that, the total who entered and likely remained rises to roughly 5‚Äì7 million [1].
- If you mean just formal humanitarian parole programs, one analysis claims ‚Äúnearly 3 million,‚Äù but that figure is debated; narrower counts of programmatic parole alone would be lower [2][3].

# ü§ñ Gemini's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

It is not possible to provide a single, definitive number for how many immigrants entered the United States under the Biden presidency because different data points measure different aspects of immigration and border management. Key metrics include border encounters, individuals paroled into the country, and estimated "gotaways."

**1. Border and Nationwide Encounters**
The most frequently cited metric is "encounters," which refers to the number of times U.S. authorities stopped individuals attempting to enter the country without authorization. This figure includes people who may have been apprehended multiple times and those who were expelled under public health orders like Title 42.

*   From the beginning of Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 through April 2024, there were more than 10 million nationwide encounters of inadmissible individuals by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Office of Field Operations (OFO) [1].
*   The vast majority of these occurred at the Southwest border, which has seen over 8.7 million encounters during the same period [1].

**2. Individuals Paroled into the U.S.**
The Biden administration has made significant use of "humanitarian parole," a legal authority that allows certain individuals to temporarily enter and live in the U.S. for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. This has been a key component of the administration's strategy to create lawful pathways and discourage irregular border crossings [2, 3].

*   **Specific Parole Programs**: Millions have been admitted through various parole initiatives. This includes programs for Afghans, Ukrainians (Uniting for Ukraine), and a process for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (CHNV) [2].
*   **CBP One App**: A significant number of individuals have been paroled after scheduling appointments at ports of entry using the CBP One mobile app. From its expansion in January 2023 through February 2024, approximately 462,000 migrants were paroled into the U.S. after using the app [2].
*   **Overall Parole Numbers**: The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), analyzing government data, estimates that nearly 3 million foreign nationals were paroled into the United States between January 2021 and February 2024 through these various programs and authorities [2].

**3. Known "Gotaways"**
"Gotaways" are individuals who U.S. Border Patrol detects crossing the border unlawfully but is unable to apprehend. This figure is an estimate and represents a group that has entered the country without being processed by authorities.

*   Since the beginning of FY 2021, there have been an estimated 1.8 million known "gotaways" at the Southwest border [1].

**Summary of Figures**
The data shows historic levels of migration. The House Committee on Homeland Security combines the figures for nationwide encounters with known gotaways to state that over 11.8 million individuals have either been apprehended or have evaded capture since early 2021 [1]. The Migration Policy Institute notes that the administration has paired new enforcement measures with the creation of these new legal pathways, leading to a "mixed legacy" of both high border encounter numbers and an expansion of lawful entry options [3].

# ü§ñ Grok's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

Determining the exact number of immigrants who "entered" the United States under President Joe Biden's administration (from January 20, 2021, to the present) is complex, as it depends on definitions of "immigrants" and "entered." Official data from U.S. government agencies like Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) typically distinguish between several categories:

- **Legal permanent residents (LPRs or green card holders)**: Individuals granted lawful permanent residency through family, employment, diversity lottery, or other visas.
- **Temporary admissions**: Nonimmigrants on visas for work, study, tourism, etc., who are not considered permanent immigrants but may enter and stay temporarily.
- **Border encounters and releases**: Migrants encountered at the southwest border, including those apprehended, expelled, paroled, or released into the U.S. pending immigration proceedings (e.g., via asylum claims or parole programs). Not all encounters result in entry; some are turned away or expelled under Title 42 (used extensively until May 2023).
- **Humanitarian parole and other programs**: Special initiatives allowing temporary entry for specific groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians, and those under the Cuba-Haiti-Nicaragua-Venezuela (CHNV) program.

Comprehensive totals are not always aggregated in a single official figure, and estimates vary by source due to differing methodologies, time frames, and political perspectives. Conservative sources often emphasize higher numbers by including border releases and parolees as "immigrants," while neutral analyses focus on legal pathways and distinguish between entries and encounters. Based on available data up to fiscal year (FY) 2024 (ending September 30, 2024), here's a breakdown of key figures. Note that Biden's term is ongoing, so numbers will increase; these are estimates through late 2024.

### Legal Permanent Residents (Green Cards)
Approximately 3.3 million individuals obtained lawful permanent resident status from FY 2021 through FY 2023, with an additional ~1 million projected for FY 2024 based on trends [4]. This includes family-sponsored immigrants, employment-based visas, refugees/asylees, and diversity visa recipients. These figures represent adjustments of status or new arrivals but do not include all temporary entries.

### Temporary Nonimmigrant Admissions
Tens of millions enter annually on temporary visas (e.g., H-1B for skilled workers, B-1/B-2 for tourists/business, F-1 for students). From 2021 to 2023, nonimmigrant admissions totaled over 100 million, but this includes multiple entries by the same individuals and is not typically counted as "immigration" since most depart [5]. Excluding short-term visitors, key temporary worker and student visas issued numbered around 2-3 million per year under Biden, similar to pre-pandemic levels [4].

### Border Encounters and Entries
CBP reported over 10 million migrant encounters at the southwest border from FY 2021 through FY 2024 (specifically: 1.7 million in FY 2021, 2.4 million in FY 2022, 2.5 million in FY 2023, and ~2.5 million in FY 2024) [6]. However:
- Not all encounters lead to entry; about 4.5 million were expelled or removed under Title 42 or other measures [1][6].
- Approximately 5-6 million were processed and allowed entry or release into the U.S., including ~3 million released pending asylum hearings or under parole [2][6]. This includes "got-aways" (estimated at 1.8 million undetected crossings from FY 2021-2024) [1], though these are not officially "entered" via legal processes.
- Conservative estimates, such as from House Republicans, claim over 10 million "illegal immigrants" entered under Biden, including encounters, releases, and got-aways [1].

### Humanitarian Parole Programs
Biden expanded parole authority, allowing temporary entry for humanitarian reasons:
- The CHNV program (launched in 2023) has admitted ~530,000 individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela through October 2024 [2][3][7].
- Afghan evacuees: ~90,000 paroled in 2021-2022 [3].
- Ukrainians: ~170,000 under Uniting for Ukraine (2022-2024) [3][7].
- Total parole entries under Biden: Approximately 1.5-3 million, depending on inclusion of smaller programs and border parole [2][3]. One analysis questions the higher end of this range, noting that not all paroles result in permanent status and some figures may double-count [2].

### Overall Estimates
- **Conservative total**: Sources critical of Biden's policies estimate 10-12 million immigrants entered, combining legal pathways (~4 million LPRs), temporary admissions, border releases (~5-6 million), parolees (~3 million), and got-aways (~2 million) [1][2].
- **Neutral/moderate total**: Focusing on those who legally entered or were admitted (excluding expulsions and temporary visitors), estimates range from 7-9 million, including ~4 million LPRs, ~1-2 million key temporary visas, and ~2-3 million border/parole admissions [3][4][5].
- **Official DHS/CBP focus**: Emphasizes encounters (10+ million) rather than a single "entry" number, with ~3.5 million removals/expulsions offsetting some entries [6][7].

These figures reflect a surge in border encounters compared to prior administrations, driven by global migration trends, policy changes (e.g., ending Title 42), and expanded legal pathways [3]. However, legal immigration levels have returned to pre-COVID norms, and Biden has implemented restrictions like asylum limits in 2024 to reduce entries [3][7]. For the most current data, refer to official government reports, as partisan sources may inflate or understate based on perspective.

# ü§ñ Claude's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

Immigration numbers under the Biden presidency involve multiple categories of entry and different data collection methods. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the available data from January 2021 through 2024.

## Legal Immigration

During the Biden administration, legal immigration has partially recovered from pandemic-era lows. In fiscal year 2022, approximately 1.02 million people obtained lawful permanent resident status (green cards), up from 707,000 in 2021 [1]. For fiscal year 2023, about 1.18 million people became lawful permanent residents [2]. Additionally, the U.S. admitted approximately 25,000 refugees in FY 2022 and 60,000 in FY 2023, reflecting increases in the refugee admissions ceiling [3].

## Border Encounters and Releases

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded approximately 2.48 million encounters at the southern border in FY 2023 and 2.05 million through the first 11 months of FY 2024 [4]. However, encounters don't equal admissions, as many involve repeat crossers and immediate expulsions or removals.

Between January 2021 and March 2024, DHS reports releasing approximately 3.3 million migrants into the United States through various pathways, including:
- Notices to Appear (NTA) in immigration court
- Parole programs
- Release on recognizance [5]

## Special Parole Programs

The Biden administration created several humanitarian parole programs:
- Over 500,000 individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) have arrived through the CHNV parole program as of mid-2024 [6]
- Approximately 200,000 Afghans were evacuated and paroled into the U.S. following the 2021 withdrawal [7]
- Over 180,000 Ukrainians have entered through the Uniting for Ukraine program [8]

## Total Estimates

Combining all categories, estimates suggest approximately 6-8 million immigrants have entered the United States under various statuses during the Biden presidency through 2024, though exact figures vary depending on methodology and which categories are included [9]. This includes legal permanent residents, refugees, parolees, asylum seekers released pending hearings, and those who entered without inspection.

It's important to note that these numbers include people with varying legal statuses - from permanent residents to those in removal proceedings - and don't necessarily represent permanent additions to the U.S. population, as some may ultimately depart voluntarily or be removed.

# ü§ñ ChatGPT's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

Short answer: There isn‚Äôt a single, universally accepted number. ‚ÄúImmigrants‚Äù can mean different things (people granted green cards, refugees resettled, migrants encountered at the border, or people released into the U.S. pending proceedings). Depending on which measure you mean, here are the best-supported totals for the Biden period, with sources and important caveats.

How to interpret ‚Äúentered‚Äù
- Lawful permanent immigrants (LPRs/‚Äúgreen cards‚Äù): This is the formal, legal definition of ‚Äúimmigrant‚Äù in U.S. statistics. Many obtain LPR status from inside the U.S. (adjustment of status), so they did not necessarily ‚Äúenter‚Äù at a port of entry during this period.
- Refugees admitted: People formally resettled through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.
- Border ‚Äúencounters‚Äù: CBP‚Äôs count of people stopped at the border. Encounters ‚â† entries; some are immediately expelled/removed, and many people are counted more than once due to repeat attempts.
- Releases/‚Äúallowed into the U.S.‚Äù: DHS does not publish a single official cumulative total, but independent analyses estimate this number to be in the low-to-mid millions during the Biden years.

What the data show
1) Lawful permanent residents (LPRs, i.e., immigrants in the legal/statistical sense)
- FY2021: about 740,000
- FY2022: about 1,018,000
- FY2023: about 1.2 million (USCIS reported issuing ‚Äúover 1 million‚Äù green cards in FY2023; detailed totals round to about 1.2 million)
Total FY2021‚ÄìFY2023: roughly 3.0 million people obtained LPR status under Biden so far [3], [4].

Notes:
- FY2021 began Oct. 1, 2020 (before Biden took office), but these are the standard fiscal-year tallies DHS publishes.
- A large share of LPRs each year adjusted status from within the U.S., so not all ‚Äúentered‚Äù during this period in the everyday sense.

2) Refugees admitted (resettled through USRAP)
- FY2021: about 11,400
- FY2022: about 25,500
- FY2023: about 60,000
Total FY2021‚ÄìFY2023: about 96,900 refugees [5].

3) Border and ports of entry: Enforcement encounters (upper bound on attempted entries, not people who entered)
- Southwest land border encounters were historically high during FY2021‚ÄìFY2024, and total nationwide encounters exceeded 9 million over Biden‚Äôs term through FY2024, according to CBP‚Äôs official year-by-year statistics that media and fact-checkers have summed. Fact-checkers stress that encounters are not the same as ‚Äúentered,‚Äù because:
  - Many were expelled/removed (including under Title 42 through May 2023).
  - The same person can be encountered multiple times.
  - Some encounters lead to lawful admission (e.g., parole at ports of entry), and some to release pending immigration proceedings [1], [2], [6].

4) How many were ‚Äúlet in‚Äù or released into the U.S. pending proceedings?
- DHS does not publish a single running total. Independent analyses that piece together DHS court, release, and parole data estimate that the number of migrants released into the U.S. during the Biden years is in the low-to-mid millions (often cited around 2‚Äì3 million through early-to-mid 2024), including people processed at the border and those paroled through programs like the CHNV parole initiative and CBP One appointments [7]. These are estimates with methodological caveats, not an official DHS total.

Bottom line
- If by ‚Äúimmigrants‚Äù you mean people granted permanent resident status (the legal/statistical definition), approximately 3.0 million people obtained green cards in FY2021‚ÄìFY2023, with FY2024 data pending final publication [3], [4].
- If you mean refugees formally resettled, about 97,000 were admitted in FY2021‚ÄìFY2023, with FY2024 expected to be significantly higher than prior years [5].
- If you mean everyone who showed up at the border, CBP recorded more than 9 million encounters nationwide during FY2021‚ÄìFY2024, but that is not the same as the number who ‚Äúentered‚Äù or remained in the U.S. [1], [2], [6].
- The number of migrants released into the U.S. during the Biden presidency is not published as a single official figure; credible independent estimates place it in the low-to-mid millions through 2024, with important caveats [7].

If you tell me which definition you want (green cards issued, refugees admitted, CBP encounters, or estimated releases/admissions), I can give a single number and the precise calculation steps.

# ü§ñ Gemini's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

The question of how many immigrants entered the United States under the Biden presidency is complex, as there is no single, all-encompassing statistic. The total number depends on the definition of "immigrant," which can include individuals who gained permanent legal status, those who entered on a temporary or humanitarian basis, and those who entered without authorization.

To provide a comprehensive answer, the numbers are broken down into several key categories based on the most recent official data available. The Biden administration began on January 20, 2021. Most government data is tracked by fiscal year (FY), which runs from October 1 to September 30.

### 1. Lawful Permanent Residents (Green Card Holders)

This is the most traditional definition of an immigrant. These are individuals granted the legal right to live and work permanently in the U.S.

*   **FY 2021 (partial Biden administration):** 740,002 individuals became lawful permanent residents [1].
*   **FY 2022:** 1,018,349 individuals became lawful permanent residents [1].
*   **FY 2023:** Data is still being compiled, but the numbers are expected to be similar to or higher than FY 2022 as processing backlogs from the COVID-19 pandemic continue to clear [2].

It is important to note that many of these individuals were already living in the U.S. on other visas and adjusted their status to permanent resident.

### 2. Southwest Border Encounters

This is the most widely cited figure in discussions about immigration, but it requires careful interpretation. An "encounter" is an event where a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer apprehends a person trying to enter between official ports of entry or finds a person to be inadmissible at a port of entry. This number does not represent the number of unique individuals who entered the country, as one person can be counted multiple times if they attempt to cross more than once (a high recidivism rate). It also does not mean all these individuals were released into the U.S.; many are expelled or detained.

*   **FY 2021:** 1,734,686 encounters [3].
*   **FY 2022:** 2,378,944 encounters [3].
*   **FY 2023:** 2,475,669 encounters [3].
*   **FY 2024 (through April 2024):** 1,586,816 encounters [3].

These figures represent record highs in the number of encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border.

### 3. Humanitarian Parole Programs

The Biden administration has made significant use of humanitarian parole, a discretionary authority that allows individuals to enter and remain in the U.S. temporarily for urgent humanitarian reasons.

*   **Afghans:** Following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, approximately 76,000 Afghans were brought to the U.S. under parole through Operation Allies Welcome [4].
*   **Ukrainians:** Through the "Uniting for Ukraine" program launched in April 2022, more than 195,000 Ukrainians had been paroled into the U.S. as of May 2024 [5].
*   **Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (CHNV):** This parole process, established in late 2022 and early 2023, allows up to 30,000 individuals per month from these countries to enter. As of April 2024, more than 434,800 individuals from these nations had arrived lawfully under this program [6].

### 4. Refugee and Asylee Admissions

*   **Refugees:** These are individuals who are admitted from abroad after being vetted and determined to be unable to return to their home country. Refugee admissions were historically low at the start of the administration but have been increasing.
    *   **FY 2021:** 11,411 (The lowest number in the program's history) [7].
    *   **FY 2022:** 25,465 [7].
    *   **FY 2023:** 60,014 [7].
*   **Asylees:** These are individuals who arrive in the U.S. and are subsequently granted protection because they have a credible fear of persecution in their home country. This data is harder to track in real time due to immense backlogs in immigration courts. In **FY 2022**, 28,159 individuals were granted asylum, but this reflects cases that may have been pending for years [1]. The number of pending asylum cases has grown to over 1 million under the Biden administration [2].

### 5. Estimated "Gotaways"

This unofficial term refers to individuals who CBP believes entered the U.S. without authorization and were detected (e.g., by sensors or cameras) but were not apprehended. These are estimates based on available surveillance and are less precise than encounter data.

*   DHS estimates indicate there were approximately **391,000** gotaways in FY 2021, **606,000** in FY 2022, and **670,000** in FY 2023 [8].

### Summary

It is impossible to provide a single number for how many immigrants entered the U.S. under the Biden presidency. However, by combining the different categories, a clearer picture emerges:

*   **Legal Permanent Immigration:** Over 1.75 million people have received green cards (FY21-FY22).
*   **Humanitarian Parole:** Well over 700,000 individuals have entered through special parole programs for Afghans, Ukrainians, and CHNV nationals.
*   **Border Encounters:** There have been over 8 million encounters at the southwest border, though this is not a count of unique individuals or successful entries.
*   **Refugees:** Nearly 100,000 refugees were admitted (FY21-FY23).

The period has been characterized by a combination of rebuilding legal immigration pathways that slowed during the pandemic, while simultaneously facing an unprecedented number of arrivals at the southern border, which the administration has managed through a mix of enforcement, expulsion policies, and the creation of new parole programs.

# ü§ñ Grok's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

### Overview of Immigration Under the Biden Presidency

The question of how many immigrants "entered" the United States under President Joe Biden's administration (which began on January 20, 2021, and continues as of this response in October 2024) requires careful clarification. "Immigrants" can refer to individuals entering legally (e.g., via visas, green cards, or refugee status) or those entering without authorization (often tracked through border encounters, apprehensions, or estimates of undetected crossings). Official data distinguishes between these categories, and not all border encounters result in entry‚Äîmany individuals are turned away, expelled, or processed for removal [1].

Data is typically reported by fiscal year (FY), running from October 1 to September 30, so Biden's term covers parts of FY 2021 (starting mid-year) through FY 2024 (ongoing). Estimates vary by source due to methodological differences: government agencies like U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provide raw data on encounters and legal admissions, while think tanks and analysts offer interpretations, including estimates of "got-aways" (those who evade detection) [2][3]. Total figures are not static, as immigration is ongoing, and numbers can include repeat attempts by the same individuals.

This response breaks down the data into legal and unauthorized immigration, providing cumulative estimates from January 2021 to August 2024 (the latest comprehensive data available). These are based on official statistics and analyses, with caveats for accuracy.

### Legal Immigration
Legal immigration includes individuals granted lawful permanent residence (green cards), temporary visas (e.g., work, student, or visitor), refugees, asylees, and other authorized entries. Under Biden, legal pathways have expanded somewhat, including humanitarian parole programs for certain nationalities (e.g., Afghans, Ukrainians, Venezuelans, Haitians, Cubans, and Nicaraguans) [4].

- **Green Cards (Lawful Permanent Residents):** Approximately 3.5 million green cards were issued from FY 2021 to FY 2023, with FY 2024 projections adding about 1 million more, for a total of around 4.5 million [1][4]. This averages about 1 million per year, consistent with pre-Biden levels but with backlogs reduced post-COVID.
  
- **Refugees and Asylees:** About 250,000 refugees were admitted from FY 2021 to FY 2023, with FY 2024 on track for 100,000 more, totaling roughly 350,000 [4]. Asylum grants (for those already in the U.S.) numbered around 150,000 over the same period [1].

- **Humanitarian Parole and Other Programs:** Over 1 million individuals entered via parole programs, including approximately 500,000 through the CHNV (Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela) program and 400,000 Ukrainians and Afghans [4][5].

- **Total Legal Entries:** Cumulatively, legal immigrants entering or adjusting status under Biden total an estimated 6-7 million, including green cards, refugees, parolees, and temporary visa holders who may later adjust status [4]. This figure excludes short-term visitors but includes those who "enter" via ports of entry or adjustments.

These numbers reflect a rebound from pandemic lows, with Biden administration policies emphasizing family reunification and humanitarian relief [4].

### Unauthorized Immigration and Border Encounters
Unauthorized immigration is harder to quantify precisely, as it relies on encounters (apprehensions or processing at borders) and estimates of undetected entries. CBP tracks "encounters" at the southwest border, which include apprehensions, inadmissibles at ports, and expulsions (e.g., under Title 42 public health authority, used until May 2023) [2]. Not all encounters lead to entry; many result in immediate removal, though some are released into the U.S. pending asylum claims or other proceedings [3].

- **Southwest Border Encounters:** From January 2021 to August 2024, there were approximately 10.1 million encounters nationwide (primarily southwest border), including:
  - FY 2021 (partial): 1.7 million
  - FY 2022: 2.4 million
  - FY 2023: 2.5 million
  - FY 2024 (through August): 2.2 million (with September estimates adding ~200,000) [2][3].
  This is a record high, driven by global migration trends, economic factors, and policy changes [3].

- **Entries from Encounters:** Of these, an estimated 4-5 million were processed and allowed entry (e.g., released with notices to appear in court or paroled), while about 4 million were expelled or removed [2][6]. Title 42 expulsions accounted for over 2.5 million rapid returns until its end [2].

- **Got-Aways (Undetected Entries):** CBP estimates about 1.8 million individuals evaded detection and entered unauthorized from FY 2021 to FY 2023, with FY 2024 adding roughly 500,000, for a total of around 2.3 million [3][6]. These are extrapolations based on camera footage, sensors, and agent observations, and are subject to debate [6].

- **Total Unauthorized Entries:** Combining processed encounters that resulted in release and got-aways, estimates range from 5-7 million unauthorized immigrants entering under Biden [3][6]. Conservative analyses often cite higher figures (e.g., 10 million+ including all encounters), but these overcount by including expulsions and repeats [6]. A more moderate estimate from nonpartisan sources is about 6 million net unauthorized entries [3].

Factors influencing these numbers include Biden's reversal of some Trump-era restrictions (e.g., ending the "Remain in Mexico" policy), increased asylum seekers from regions like Venezuela and Haiti, and global events like the COVID-19 recovery [3][5].

### Overall Total and Caveats
Adding legal and unauthorized categories, a broad estimate of total immigrants entering the U.S. under Biden is 11-14 million from January 2021 to August 2024 [3][4][6]. This includes:
- 6-7 million legal.
- 5-7 million unauthorized.

However, this is not a precise "entry" count:
- Many legal immigrants adjust status while already in the U.S., not necessarily "entering" anew.
- Unauthorized figures include estimates, not exact counts, and net migration accounts for outflows (e.g., deportations: over 1.5 million under Biden) [1][2].
- Comparisons to prior administrations: Encounters were lower under Trump (e.g., 400,000-800,000 annually pre-COVID), but legal immigration was similar [3].
- Recent trends: Encounters dropped sharply in mid-2024 after Biden's June 2024 executive order restricting asylum, with August 2024 at ~58,000, the lowest in years [2].

These figures are debated politically: Progressive sources emphasize humanitarian needs and legal pathways [5], while conservative ones highlight border security failures [6]. For the most current data, consult CBP's monthly updates.
