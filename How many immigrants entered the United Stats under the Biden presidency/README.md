# 🤖 Claude's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

The number of immigrants who entered the United States under the Biden presidency varies significantly depending on how "immigrants" are defined and which data sources are used. The Biden administration, which began in January 2021, has overseen a complex period of immigration with multiple entry pathways and categories.

## Overall Immigration Numbers

According to Department of Homeland Security data, approximately 10 million encounters occurred at U.S. borders between fiscal years 2021-2024 under the Biden administration [1]. However, encounters do not equal unique individuals, as some people are encountered multiple times, and not all encounters result in entry into the United States.

The Migration Policy Institute reports that the Biden administration has presided over record-high immigration levels, with both legal and unauthorized immigration reaching historic numbers [2]. The total foreign-born population in the United States reached approximately 47.8 million by 2023, representing about 14.3% of the total U.S. population [3].

## Unauthorized Immigration

The Pew Research Center estimates that the unauthorized immigrant population living in the United States reached a record 14 million in 2023, up from approximately 10.5 million in 2019 [4]. This represents an increase of roughly 3.5 million during the Biden presidency, though not all of these individuals necessarily entered during this period.

## Legal Immigration and Parole Programs

The Biden administration has utilized various parole programs extensively. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, nearly 3 million individuals were paroled into the United States under Biden's presidency through various programs [5]. These include:

- The Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan (CHNV) parole program, which allowed up to 30,000 individuals per month
- Afghan evacuees following the withdrawal from Afghanistan (approximately 80,000)
- Ukrainian refugees under the Uniting for Ukraine program (over 200,000)

Legal permanent resident admissions have averaged approximately 1 million per year during the Biden administration, consistent with pre-pandemic levels [2].

## Border Encounters and Releases

House Committee on Homeland Security data indicates that millions of encounters at the southern border resulted in various outcomes, including removals, returns, and releases into the United States [1]. The exact number of individuals who successfully entered and remained in the country is difficult to determine due to factors such as:

- Multiple encounters of the same individuals
- "Gotaways" (individuals who evaded detection)
- Various legal statuses and pending immigration proceedings

## Total Estimate

Combining various categories, a conservative estimate suggests that between 5-7 million immigrants (including both authorized and unauthorized) have entered and remained in the United States during the Biden presidency. This includes legal permanent residents, parolees, asylum seekers, and unauthorized entries. However, precise figures remain contested due to data limitations and definitional differences.

# 🤖 ChatGPT's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

Short answer: There is no single official “immigrants who entered” number. It depends on what you mean. Under President Biden (January 2021 onward), the most commonly cited metrics are:

- Border encounters (nationwide). CBP recorded roughly 10–11 million migrant encounters across FY2021–FY2024, including a record 3.2 million in FY2023 alone. Congressional testimony in April 2025 characterizes the cumulative total since January 2021 as “more than 10 million.” Note that “encounters” are events, not people, and some individuals are encountered more than once [1][2][3].  
- Southwest land border encounters. About 8.6 million at the Southwest border across FY2021–FY2024 (approx. 1.73m in FY2021, 2.38m in FY2022, 2.48m in FY2023, and just over 2.0m in FY2024) [2].  
- Admitted or released into the U.S. via parole or similar processing. Estimates vary. A critical analysis places the number paroled under Biden at “nearly 3 million,” counting multiple parole programs and border releases; other researchers emphasize that methods differ and many people were also removed or returned at the border [4][5].  
- Change in the unauthorized immigrant population. The total unauthorized population living in the U.S. reached a record 14 million in 2023, indicating substantial net growth during Biden’s first years, but this is a stock (who resides here), not the same as total entrants or encounters [6].

How to interpret these numbers
- Encounters are not admissions. They reflect people stopped by Border Patrol or processed at ports of entry. Many were expelled or removed; others were released into the U.S. pending proceedings, sometimes on parole.  
- “Parole” counts are contested. Some analysts aggregate multiple programs and timeframes to reach “nearly 3 million,” while others caution that different programs (e.g., for Ukrainians, Cubans/Haitians/Nicaraguans/Venezuelans via sponsorship, CBP One scheduling) have different rules, durations, and outcomes [4][5].  
- The unauthorized population figure shows net change after accounting for entries, departures, deaths, and status adjustments; it does not equal the number who crossed in any given year [6].

Bottom line: If by “entered” you mean CBP-recorded border encounters during Biden’s tenure, the cumulative figure is on the order of 10–11 million through FY2024, with about 8.6 million at the Southwest land border alone. Of those, a few million were likely allowed into the U.S. to await proceedings (including via parole), while many others were removed or turned back; precise “admitted” counts depend on definitions and are debated among researchers [1][2][3][4][5][6].

# 🤖 Gemini's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

There is no single official number for how many immigrants entered the U.S. under the Biden presidency, as the total varies significantly depending on the category of immigration being measured. Different metrics track different populations, including unauthorized arrivals, individuals granted temporary permission to enter, and those who have obtained legal permanent residency.

A comprehensive answer requires looking at several key figures:

**1. Border Encounters and Unauthorized Immigration**
The most frequently cited statistic is "border encounters," which are apprehensions or expulsions of migrants by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). This number does not represent the total number of unique individuals who entered the country, as one person can be apprehended multiple times.

*   **Border Encounters:** From February 2021 to April 2024, CBP recorded over 8 million encounters with migrants at the U.S. Southwest border [5]. This figure includes individuals who were expelled under public health orders like Title 42 as well as those processed under standard immigration law [3].
*   **Growth in Unauthorized Population:** A more comprehensive measure of net change is the total unauthorized immigrant population. According to the Pew Research Center, this population reached a record 14 million in 2023. This represents a growth of 2.6 million people since 2019, with a significant increase occurring in 2022 and 2023 [4]. This figure accounts for people who entered without authorization and overstayed visas, minus those who left the country or gained legal status.

**2. Parole Programs**
The Biden administration has made extensive use of "humanitarian parole," a legal authority that allows the government to grant temporary permission for individuals to enter and live in the U.S.

*   The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), an organization that advocates for lower immigration, estimates that the administration has used parole and other programs to allow "nearly three million" individuals into the country who would not otherwise have a visa to enter [2].
*   These programs include a process for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV), as well as parole for Ukrainians and Afghans [3]. Many of these individuals are processed at official ports of entry after making an appointment through the CBP One mobile app [3].

**3. Lawful Immigration**
This category includes individuals who are granted lawful permanent residence (a green card) or are admitted on temporary nonimmigrant visas.

*   **Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs):** In fiscal year (FY) 2021, approximately 740,000 people became lawful permanent residents. In FY 2022, that number increased to over 1 million [6]. These figures include individuals who were already living in the U.S. on a temporary status and adjusted to LPR status, as well as new arrivals.
*   **Nonimmigrant Visas:** Millions of people also enter the U.S. each year on temporary visas for work, study, or tourism. For example, in FY 2022, there were 2.9 million admissions for temporary workers and their families and 1.1 million admissions for international students and their families [6].

In summary, millions of people have entered the United States through various channels during the Biden presidency. The most cited figures include over 8 million border encounters (which is not a count of unique individuals), a net increase of 2.6 million in the unauthorized population from 2019 to 2023, and millions more who entered legally through parole programs or with permanent or temporary visas [2, 4, 5, 6].

Immigration flows under the Biden presidency have been substantial and complex, involving multiple categories of migrants and various legal pathways. From January 2021 through fiscal year 2024, millions of people have entered the United States through different channels.

## Border Encounters and Releases

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported approximately 10 million encounters at U.S. borders from February 2021 through September 2024 [1]. However, encounters do not equal individual immigrants, as the same person can be encountered multiple times. The Department of Homeland Security estimates that roughly 2.5 million individuals were released into the United States after border encounters from January 2021 through September 2023 [2].

## Legal Immigration Pathways

During fiscal years 2021-2023, the United States admitted approximately:
- 2.2 million lawful permanent residents (green card holders) [3]
- Over 1 million temporary workers and their families through various visa programs [3]
- Approximately 500,000 international students annually [3]

## Humanitarian Programs

The Biden administration has implemented several humanitarian programs:
- Over 400,000 individuals from Ukraine, Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela have arrived through specific parole programs as of early 2024 [4]
- Approximately 150,000 Afghan evacuees were resettled following the 2021 withdrawal [5]
- The refugee admissions program admitted about 60,000 refugees in FY 2023, up from historic lows during the previous administration [3]

## Total Estimates

Combining all categories, credible estimates suggest that between 8-10 million foreign nationals have entered and remained in the United States under some form of legal status or pending immigration proceedings since January 2021 [2][4]. This includes those released pending immigration hearings, legal immigrants, temporary visa holders, and humanitarian parolees.

It's important to note that these numbers include various categories with different legal statuses, and not all individuals who enter ultimately remain permanently in the United States. Many temporary visa holders, for instance, are expected to depart when their visas expire.

# 🤖 ChatGPT's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

Short answer: There isn’t one single, universally accepted number. “Immigrants” can mean several different things in U.S. statistics. Below are the main ways experts and agencies count “people entering,” with the best available official totals during the Biden presidency.

What “immigrants entered” can mean, with counts

1) Lawful permanent residents (LPRs, “green card” holders) — the legal definition of “immigrant” in U.S. law
- FY2021: 740,002
- FY2022: 1,018,349
- FY2023: “more than 1 million” green cards issued
Total for FY2021–FY2023: about 2.76 million LPRs, with FY2024 data not fully consolidated publicly at the time of the latest releases. [1][2]

2) Refugees admitted (humanitarian admissions; not LPRs upon arrival)
- FY2021: 11,411
- FY2022: 25,465
- FY2023: 60,014
Total for FY2021–FY2023: 96,890 refugee arrivals. [3]

3) Asylum grants inside the U.S. (people granted asylum status after applying; separate from refugees)
- FY2022: 36,615 grants (latest consolidated DHS “flow” report as of the most recent publications). Annual totals vary; 2023 consolidated data were not yet in a DHS “flow report” at last publication. [4]

4) Large humanitarian parole programs (temporary permission to enter and stay)
- Cuba–Haiti–Nicaragua–Venezuela (CHNV) parole: more than 404,000 arrivals since launch in January 2023 (as of April 10, 2024). [5]
- Afghan evacuees (Operation Allies Welcome): more than 88,500 arrivals (parole) reported in DHS and interagency fact sheets. [6]
Note: Other parole initiatives (e.g., Uniting for Ukraine) also brought substantial numbers, but the most recent authoritative, consolidated counts vary over time and by program.

5) Southwest border “encounters” (attempts detected by CBP between or at ports of entry, not the same as people who entered and remained)
These are widely cited in public debate but are not a count of admissions, because many encounters result in removals/expulsions, and some people are counted more than once due to repeat attempts.
- FY2021: 1,734,686
- FY2022: 2,378,944
- FY2023: 2,475,669
Total encounters at the Southwest border for FY2021–FY2023: about 6.59 million. FY2024 also recorded high activity, but year-end totals should be taken from the latest CBP releases. [7]

How to interpret this

- If you mean “immigrants” in the technical legal sense (people who obtained lawful permanent residence), about 2.76 million became LPRs during FY2021–FY2023, with additional LPRs in FY2024 that will push the multi-year total higher once DHS/USCIS publish final FY2024 statistics. [1][2]

- If you mean people who came through humanitarian channels:
  - Refugees admitted in FY2021–FY2023 totaled about 96,890. [3]
  - Large parole programs brought several hundred thousand more (e.g., 404,000+ via CHNV since Jan 2023 and 88,500+ Afghans), plus additional arrivals via other parole pathways (e.g., Ukrainians). Totals across all parole programs change frequently and should be read program-by-program to avoid double-counting. [5][6]

- If you mean all “migrant encounters” at the southern border, CBP reported about 6.59 million encounters in FY2021–FY2023 alone. But that is not a count of people who entered and stayed; many were expelled or removed, and some individuals were encountered multiple times. CBP does not publish a single, definitive “entries and stayed” total for these encounters. [7]

Bottom line
- By the legal definition of “immigrant” (new LPRs), about 2.76 million people obtained green cards in FY2021–FY2023, with more in FY2024 once finalized. [1][2]
- Broader counts (refugees, asylees, and parolees) add substantial numbers, but they are distinct categories and should not be lumped together without careful caveats to avoid double-counting and misinterpretation.
- “Border encounters” are often misread as “entries”; they are not the same. [7]

Note on sources’ perspectives:
- DHS OIS, USCIS, CBP, and State/WRAPSNET are official U.S. government statistical sources; they describe categories precisely and do not conflate encounters with admissions.
- DHS press materials on parole programs report program-specific admissions; totals are program-scoped and time-bound, emphasizing lawful pathways.
- Because categories overlap (e.g., an asylee may later adjust to LPR), combining them into one “grand total” risks double-counting; the agencies themselves publish them separately for accuracy.

Answering the question of how many immigrants entered the United States under the Biden presidency requires examining several different categories of entry, as there is no single, all-encompassing statistic. The total number depends on whether one is counting lawful permanent residents, individuals apprehended at the border, those who entered without detection, or people admitted through special temporary programs.

Below is a breakdown of the most relevant figures based on available data from January 20, 2021, to the most recently available statistics.

### 1. Encounters at the U.S. Border

This is the most frequently cited metric, but it does not represent the number of unique individuals who successfully entered and stayed in the country. "Encounters" are events, not people, and include apprehensions of individuals crossing between ports of entry and those deemed inadmissible at legal ports of entry. The same person may be counted multiple times if they attempt to cross more than once.

*   **Southwest Border Encounters (Fiscal Years):**
    *   **FY 2021:** 1,734,686 (The fiscal year began under the Trump administration, but the majority of encounters occurred after January 2021) [1].
    *   **FY 2022:** 2,378,944 [1].
    *   **FY 2023:** 2,475,669 [1].
    *   **FY 2024 (October 2023 - April 2024):** 1,586,819 [1].

    **Total Southwest Border Encounters (Feb 2021 - April 2024): Over 7.8 million** [1].

It is critical to note that during much of this period (until May 2023), the Title 42 public health order was in effect. This policy allowed for the rapid expulsion of many migrants, which led to a higher rate of repeat crossing attempts, inflating the total encounter numbers [2]. After Title 42 ended, encounters initially dropped but then rose again, with consequences for illegal entry shifting from simple expulsion to more severe penalties like deportation and a five-year ban on reentry [3].

### 2. Known "Gotaways"

"Gotaways" is an unofficial term used by Border Patrol to describe individuals who are detected crossing the border illegally but are not apprehended. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provides official estimates for this group.

*   **Estimated "Gotaways" (Fiscal Years):**
    *   **FY 2021:** 389,155 [4].
    *   **FY 2022:** 606,131 [4].
    *   **FY 2023:** 670,674 [4].

    **Total Estimated "Gotaways" (FY 2021 - FY 2023): Over 1.6 million** [4].

These figures represent the best government estimate of individuals who entered the U.S. without authorization and without being processed by immigration officials.

### 3. Lawful Permanent Residents (Green Card Holders)

This category includes individuals who were granted lawful permanent residence. These are the people most traditionally defined as "immigrants." These numbers often reflect the processing of applications filed years earlier and include individuals already living in the U.S. on other visas.

*   **New Lawful Permanent Residents (Fiscal Years):**
    *   **FY 2021:** 740,002 [5].
    *   **FY 2022:** 1,018,349 [5].
    *   **FY 2023:** 1,089,836 (preliminary) [6].

    **Total New Green Card Holders (FY 2021 - FY 2023): Approximately 2.85 million** [5, 6].

### 4. Humanitarian Parole and Other Legal Pathways

The Biden administration created or expanded several humanitarian parole programs that allow individuals from specific countries to enter and remain in the U.S. temporarily. These individuals are legally present but do not have permanent resident status.

*   **Uniting for Ukraine:** As of May 2024, more than 201,000 Ukrainians have been granted parole to enter the U.S. under this program and other pathways since 2022 [7].
*   **CHNV Parole Process (Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans):** From the program's start in late 2022/early 2023 through April 2024, approximately 434,800 nationals from these four countries were granted parole and have arrived in the U.S. [8].
*   **CBP One App:** This mobile application allows migrants in Mexico to schedule appointments at ports of entry to be processed in an orderly fashion. From its introduction in January 2023 through April 2024, over 592,000 individuals have scheduled appointments using the app [8].

### Summary

To provide a comprehensive answer, it is best to separate the categories:

*   **Border Encounters:** Over **7.8 million** encounters have occurred at the Southwest border since February 2021, though this figure includes repeat crossers and those who were expelled.
*   **Irregular Immigration (Successful Entries):** An estimated **1.6 million+** "gotaways" have entered without being apprehended since FY 2021. This number, combined with those released into the country after being apprehended, represents the population of new undocumented immigrants.
*   **Lawful Permanent Immigration:** Approximately **2.85 million** people became lawful permanent residents (received green cards) in FY 2021, 2022, and 2023.
*   **Parole and Special Programs:** Over **1.2 million** individuals have been processed into the country through new legal pathways like the Uniting for Ukraine program, the CHNV parole process, and the CBP One app.

These figures illustrate that immigration under the Biden administration has been characterized by historically high levels of encounters at the border, a significant number of successful irregular entries, a steady flow of lawful permanent residents, and the creation of new, large-scale parole programs to manage migration flows.
