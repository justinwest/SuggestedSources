Short answer: There is no single official count for “how many immigrants entered” because it depends on what you include. Under President Biden (since January 2021), CBP recorded roughly 10–11 million border encounters. The number who were allowed into and remain in the U.S. is much lower but still in the millions: congressional testimony and independent analyses put releases/parole into the U.S. in the range of about 3–5 million, plus roughly 2 million “known gotaways.” If you count only formal humanitarian parole programs, one prominent estimate argues “nearly 3 million” were paroled, though that methodology is contested and may overstate by mixing distinct categories of parole and releases [1][2][3][4].

What the data show (and how to interpret it)
- Border encounters (not the same as entries or admissions): CBP reports more than 10 million encounters nationwide since the start of 2021; this figure includes repeat crossers and many people who were expelled or removed and thus did not remain in the U.S. [1][3][4].
- Known gotaways: Roughly 1.9–2.0 million people are estimated to have entered unlawfully without being apprehended during this period, based on DHS/CBP tallies cited in congressional testimony [1].
- Released into the U.S. interior pending proceedings: Multiple oversight and analytic sources put this figure in the low-to-mid millions since 2021 (on the order of 3–5 million), reflecting a mix of notices to appear/report, parole, and alternatives to detention. Precise totals vary by methodology and cut-off date [1][3].
- Humanitarian parole: One analysis argues the administration has “paroled in nearly 3 million” people by early 2025, counting both programmatic parolees (e.g., Afghans, Ukrainians, and the CHNV processes) and parole used operationally at the border. Other experts caution that conflating programmatic parole with case-by-case border processing inflates the impression of “parole admissions” as a distinct pathway [2][3].
- Lawful permanent immigration (green cards): Separate from the border situation, the U.S. has continued to grant roughly 1 million lawful permanent resident statuses per year (many to people already inside the U.S. adjusting status). These are “immigrants” in the legal sense but are not typically what people mean when asking about border entries. Official DHS yearbooks provide the exact annual counts by fiscal year [3].

Why estimates differ
- “Encounter” does not equal “entered” or “stayed.” Many encountered individuals were expelled under Title 42 (in 2021–2023) or removed; others tried multiple times, so totals include duplicates [3][4].
- Releases vs. parole: DHS uses several legal authorities (e.g., notices to appear/report, parole under INA 212(d)(5)). Some estimates combine these; others count only programmatic parole (e.g., Ukrainians, Afghans, CHNV) [2][3].
- Gotaways are estimates. They are tracked operationally and come with uncertainty; including or excluding them changes the “entered” total materially [1].

Bottom line
- If by “entered” you mean all border encounters, the number is about 10–11 million since January 2021 [1][3][4].
- If you mean people allowed into the country and not immediately removed (releases plus parole), a reasonable order-of-magnitude estimate is roughly 3–5 million through early 2025, with methodology-dependent uncertainty [1][3].
- If you add known gotaways to that, the total who entered and likely remained rises to roughly 5–7 million [1].
- If you mean just formal humanitarian parole programs, one analysis claims “nearly 3 million,” but that figure is debated; narrower counts of programmatic parole alone would be lower [2][3].
