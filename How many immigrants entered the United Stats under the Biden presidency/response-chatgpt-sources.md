Short answer: There is no single official “immigrants who entered” number. It depends on what you mean. Under President Biden (January 2021 onward), the most commonly cited metrics are:

- Border encounters (nationwide). CBP recorded roughly 10–11 million migrant encounters across FY2021–FY2024, including a record 3.2 million in FY2023 alone. Congressional testimony in April 2025 characterizes the cumulative total since January 2021 as “more than 10 million.” Note that “encounters” are events, not people, and some individuals are encountered more than once [1][2][3].  
- Southwest land border encounters. About 8.6 million at the Southwest border across FY2021–FY2024 (approx. 1.73m in FY2021, 2.38m in FY2022, 2.48m in FY2023, and just over 2.0m in FY2024) [2].  
- Admitted or released into the U.S. via parole or similar processing. Estimates vary. A critical analysis places the number paroled under Biden at “nearly 3 million,” counting multiple parole programs and border releases; other researchers emphasize that methods differ and many people were also removed or returned at the border [4][5].  
- Change in the unauthorized immigrant population. The total unauthorized population living in the U.S. reached a record 14 million in 2023, indicating substantial net growth during Biden’s first years, but this is a stock (who resides here), not the same as total entrants or encounters [6].

How to interpret these numbers
- Encounters are not admissions. They reflect people stopped by Border Patrol or processed at ports of entry. Many were expelled or removed; others were released into the U.S. pending proceedings, sometimes on parole.  
- “Parole” counts are contested. Some analysts aggregate multiple programs and timeframes to reach “nearly 3 million,” while others caution that different programs (e.g., for Ukrainians, Cubans/Haitians/Nicaraguans/Venezuelans via sponsorship, CBP One scheduling) have different rules, durations, and outcomes [4][5].  
- The unauthorized population figure shows net change after accounting for entries, departures, deaths, and status adjustments; it does not equal the number who crossed in any given year [6].

Bottom line: If by “entered” you mean CBP-recorded border encounters during Biden’s tenure, the cumulative figure is on the order of 10–11 million through FY2024, with about 8.6 million at the Southwest land border alone. Of those, a few million were likely allowed into the U.S. to await proceedings (including via parole), while many others were removed or turned back; precise “admitted” counts depend on definitions and are debated among researchers [1][2][3][4][5][6].
