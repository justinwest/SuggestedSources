It is not possible to provide a single, definitive number for how many immigrants entered the United States under the Biden presidency because different data points measure different aspects of immigration and border management. Key metrics include border encounters, individuals paroled into the country, and estimated "gotaways."

**1. Border and Nationwide Encounters**
The most frequently cited metric is "encounters," which refers to the number of times U.S. authorities stopped individuals attempting to enter the country without authorization. This figure includes people who may have been apprehended multiple times and those who were expelled under public health orders like Title 42.

*   From the beginning of Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 through April 2024, there were more than 10 million nationwide encounters of inadmissible individuals by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Office of Field Operations (OFO) [1].
*   The vast majority of these occurred at the Southwest border, which has seen over 8.7 million encounters during the same period [1].

**2. Individuals Paroled into the U.S.**
The Biden administration has made significant use of "humanitarian parole," a legal authority that allows certain individuals to temporarily enter and live in the U.S. for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. This has been a key component of the administration's strategy to create lawful pathways and discourage irregular border crossings [2, 3].

*   **Specific Parole Programs**: Millions have been admitted through various parole initiatives. This includes programs for Afghans, Ukrainians (Uniting for Ukraine), and a process for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (CHNV) [2].
*   **CBP One App**: A significant number of individuals have been paroled after scheduling appointments at ports of entry using the CBP One mobile app. From its expansion in January 2023 through February 2024, approximately 462,000 migrants were paroled into the U.S. after using the app [2].
*   **Overall Parole Numbers**: The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), analyzing government data, estimates that nearly 3 million foreign nationals were paroled into the United States between January 2021 and February 2024 through these various programs and authorities [2].

**3. Known "Gotaways"**
"Gotaways" are individuals who U.S. Border Patrol detects crossing the border unlawfully but is unable to apprehend. This figure is an estimate and represents a group that has entered the country without being processed by authorities.

*   Since the beginning of FY 2021, there have been an estimated 1.8 million known "gotaways" at the Southwest border [1].

**Summary of Figures**
The data shows historic levels of migration. The House Committee on Homeland Security combines the figures for nationwide encounters with known gotaways to state that over 11.8 million individuals have either been apprehended or have evaded capture since early 2021 [1]. The Migration Policy Institute notes that the administration has paired new enforcement measures with the creation of these new legal pathways, leading to a "mixed legacy" of both high border encounter numbers and an expansion of lawful entry options [3].
