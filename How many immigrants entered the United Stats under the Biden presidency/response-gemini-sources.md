There is no single official number for how many immigrants entered the U.S. under the Biden presidency, as the total varies significantly depending on the category of immigration being measured. Different metrics track different populations, including unauthorized arrivals, individuals granted temporary permission to enter, and those who have obtained legal permanent residency.

A comprehensive answer requires looking at several key figures:

**1. Border Encounters and Unauthorized Immigration**
The most frequently cited statistic is "border encounters," which are apprehensions or expulsions of migrants by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). This number does not represent the total number of unique individuals who entered the country, as one person can be apprehended multiple times.

*   **Border Encounters:** From February 2021 to April 2024, CBP recorded over 8 million encounters with migrants at the U.S. Southwest border [5]. This figure includes individuals who were expelled under public health orders like Title 42 as well as those processed under standard immigration law [3].
*   **Growth in Unauthorized Population:** A more comprehensive measure of net change is the total unauthorized immigrant population. According to the Pew Research Center, this population reached a record 14 million in 2023. This represents a growth of 2.6 million people since 2019, with a significant increase occurring in 2022 and 2023 [4]. This figure accounts for people who entered without authorization and overstayed visas, minus those who left the country or gained legal status.

**2. Parole Programs**
The Biden administration has made extensive use of "humanitarian parole," a legal authority that allows the government to grant temporary permission for individuals to enter and live in the U.S.

*   The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), an organization that advocates for lower immigration, estimates that the administration has used parole and other programs to allow "nearly three million" individuals into the country who would not otherwise have a visa to enter [2].
*   These programs include a process for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV), as well as parole for Ukrainians and Afghans [3]. Many of these individuals are processed at official ports of entry after making an appointment through the CBP One mobile app [3].

**3. Lawful Immigration**
This category includes individuals who are granted lawful permanent residence (a green card) or are admitted on temporary nonimmigrant visas.

*   **Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs):** In fiscal year (FY) 2021, approximately 740,000 people became lawful permanent residents. In FY 2022, that number increased to over 1 million [6]. These figures include individuals who were already living in the U.S. on a temporary status and adjusted to LPR status, as well as new arrivals.
*   **Nonimmigrant Visas:** Millions of people also enter the U.S. each year on temporary visas for work, study, or tourism. For example, in FY 2022, there were 2.9 million admissions for temporary workers and their families and 1.1 million admissions for international students and their families [6].

In summary, millions of people have entered the United States through various channels during the Biden presidency. The most cited figures include over 8 million border encounters (which is not a count of unique individuals), a net increase of 2.6 million in the unauthorized population from 2019 to 2023, and millions more who entered legally through parole programs or with permanent or temporary visas [2, 4, 5, 6].
