Short answer: There isn’t a single, universally accepted number. “Immigrants” can mean different things (people granted green cards, refugees resettled, migrants encountered at the border, or people released into the U.S. pending proceedings). Depending on which measure you mean, here are the best-supported totals for the Biden period, with sources and important caveats.

How to interpret “entered”
- Lawful permanent immigrants (LPRs/“green cards”): This is the formal, legal definition of “immigrant” in U.S. statistics. Many obtain LPR status from inside the U.S. (adjustment of status), so they did not necessarily “enter” at a port of entry during this period.
- Refugees admitted: People formally resettled through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.
- Border “encounters”: CBP’s count of people stopped at the border. Encounters ≠ entries; some are immediately expelled/removed, and many people are counted more than once due to repeat attempts.
- Releases/“allowed into the U.S.”: DHS does not publish a single official cumulative total, but independent analyses estimate this number to be in the low-to-mid millions during the Biden years.

What the data show
1) Lawful permanent residents (LPRs, i.e., immigrants in the legal/statistical sense)
- FY2021: about 740,000
- FY2022: about 1,018,000
- FY2023: about 1.2 million (USCIS reported issuing “over 1 million” green cards in FY2023; detailed totals round to about 1.2 million)
Total FY2021–FY2023: roughly 3.0 million people obtained LPR status under Biden so far [3], [4].

Notes:
- FY2021 began Oct. 1, 2020 (before Biden took office), but these are the standard fiscal-year tallies DHS publishes.
- A large share of LPRs each year adjusted status from within the U.S., so not all “entered” during this period in the everyday sense.

2) Refugees admitted (resettled through USRAP)
- FY2021: about 11,400
- FY2022: about 25,500
- FY2023: about 60,000
Total FY2021–FY2023: about 96,900 refugees [5].

3) Border and ports of entry: Enforcement encounters (upper bound on attempted entries, not people who entered)
- Southwest land border encounters were historically high during FY2021–FY2024, and total nationwide encounters exceeded 9 million over Biden’s term through FY2024, according to CBP’s official year-by-year statistics that media and fact-checkers have summed. Fact-checkers stress that encounters are not the same as “entered,” because:
  - Many were expelled/removed (including under Title 42 through May 2023).
  - The same person can be encountered multiple times.
  - Some encounters lead to lawful admission (e.g., parole at ports of entry), and some to release pending immigration proceedings [1], [2], [6].

4) How many were “let in” or released into the U.S. pending proceedings?
- DHS does not publish a single running total. Independent analyses that piece together DHS court, release, and parole data estimate that the number of migrants released into the U.S. during the Biden years is in the low-to-mid millions (often cited around 2–3 million through early-to-mid 2024), including people processed at the border and those paroled through programs like the CHNV parole initiative and CBP One appointments [7]. These are estimates with methodological caveats, not an official DHS total.

Bottom line
- If by “immigrants” you mean people granted permanent resident status (the legal/statistical definition), approximately 3.0 million people obtained green cards in FY2021–FY2023, with FY2024 data pending final publication [3], [4].
- If you mean refugees formally resettled, about 97,000 were admitted in FY2021–FY2023, with FY2024 expected to be significantly higher than prior years [5].
- If you mean everyone who showed up at the border, CBP recorded more than 9 million encounters nationwide during FY2021–FY2024, but that is not the same as the number who “entered” or remained in the U.S. [1], [2], [6].
- The number of migrants released into the U.S. during the Biden presidency is not published as a single official figure; credible independent estimates place it in the low-to-mid millions through 2024, with important caveats [7].

If you tell me which definition you want (green cards issued, refugees admitted, CBP encounters, or estimated releases/admissions), I can give a single number and the precise calculation steps.
