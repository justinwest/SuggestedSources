Short answer: There isn’t one single, universally accepted number. “Immigrants” can mean several different things in U.S. statistics. Below are the main ways experts and agencies count “people entering,” with the best available official totals during the Biden presidency.

What “immigrants entered” can mean, with counts

1) Lawful permanent residents (LPRs, “green card” holders) — the legal definition of “immigrant” in U.S. law
- FY2021: 740,002
- FY2022: 1,018,349
- FY2023: “more than 1 million” green cards issued
Total for FY2021–FY2023: about 2.76 million LPRs, with FY2024 data not fully consolidated publicly at the time of the latest releases. [1][2]

2) Refugees admitted (humanitarian admissions; not LPRs upon arrival)
- FY2021: 11,411
- FY2022: 25,465
- FY2023: 60,014
Total for FY2021–FY2023: 96,890 refugee arrivals. [3]

3) Asylum grants inside the U.S. (people granted asylum status after applying; separate from refugees)
- FY2022: 36,615 grants (latest consolidated DHS “flow” report as of the most recent publications). Annual totals vary; 2023 consolidated data were not yet in a DHS “flow report” at last publication. [4]

4) Large humanitarian parole programs (temporary permission to enter and stay)
- Cuba–Haiti–Nicaragua–Venezuela (CHNV) parole: more than 404,000 arrivals since launch in January 2023 (as of April 10, 2024). [5]
- Afghan evacuees (Operation Allies Welcome): more than 88,500 arrivals (parole) reported in DHS and interagency fact sheets. [6]
Note: Other parole initiatives (e.g., Uniting for Ukraine) also brought substantial numbers, but the most recent authoritative, consolidated counts vary over time and by program.

5) Southwest border “encounters” (attempts detected by CBP between or at ports of entry, not the same as people who entered and remained)
These are widely cited in public debate but are not a count of admissions, because many encounters result in removals/expulsions, and some people are counted more than once due to repeat attempts.
- FY2021: 1,734,686
- FY2022: 2,378,944
- FY2023: 2,475,669
Total encounters at the Southwest border for FY2021–FY2023: about 6.59 million. FY2024 also recorded high activity, but year-end totals should be taken from the latest CBP releases. [7]

How to interpret this

- If you mean “immigrants” in the technical legal sense (people who obtained lawful permanent residence), about 2.76 million became LPRs during FY2021–FY2023, with additional LPRs in FY2024 that will push the multi-year total higher once DHS/USCIS publish final FY2024 statistics. [1][2]

- If you mean people who came through humanitarian channels:
  - Refugees admitted in FY2021–FY2023 totaled about 96,890. [3]
  - Large parole programs brought several hundred thousand more (e.g., 404,000+ via CHNV since Jan 2023 and 88,500+ Afghans), plus additional arrivals via other parole pathways (e.g., Ukrainians). Totals across all parole programs change frequently and should be read program-by-program to avoid double-counting. [5][6]

- If you mean all “migrant encounters” at the southern border, CBP reported about 6.59 million encounters in FY2021–FY2023 alone. But that is not a count of people who entered and stayed; many were expelled or removed, and some individuals were encountered multiple times. CBP does not publish a single, definitive “entries and stayed” total for these encounters. [7]

Bottom line
- By the legal definition of “immigrant” (new LPRs), about 2.76 million people obtained green cards in FY2021–FY2023, with more in FY2024 once finalized. [1][2]
- Broader counts (refugees, asylees, and parolees) add substantial numbers, but they are distinct categories and should not be lumped together without careful caveats to avoid double-counting and misinterpretation.
- “Border encounters” are often misread as “entries”; they are not the same. [7]

Note on sources’ perspectives:
- DHS OIS, USCIS, CBP, and State/WRAPSNET are official U.S. government statistical sources; they describe categories precisely and do not conflate encounters with admissions.
- DHS press materials on parole programs report program-specific admissions; totals are program-scoped and time-bound, emphasizing lawful pathways.
- Because categories overlap (e.g., an asylee may later adjust to LPR), combining them into one “grand total” risks double-counting; the agencies themselves publish them separately for accuracy.
