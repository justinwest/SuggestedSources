Immigration numbers under the Biden presidency involve multiple categories of entry and different data collection methods. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the available data from January 2021 through 2024.

## Legal Immigration

During the Biden administration, legal immigration has partially recovered from pandemic-era lows. In fiscal year 2022, approximately 1.02 million people obtained lawful permanent resident status (green cards), up from 707,000 in 2021 [1]. For fiscal year 2023, about 1.18 million people became lawful permanent residents [2]. Additionally, the U.S. admitted approximately 25,000 refugees in FY 2022 and 60,000 in FY 2023, reflecting increases in the refugee admissions ceiling [3].

## Border Encounters and Releases

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded approximately 2.48 million encounters at the southern border in FY 2023 and 2.05 million through the first 11 months of FY 2024 [4]. However, encounters don't equal admissions, as many involve repeat crossers and immediate expulsions or removals.

Between January 2021 and March 2024, DHS reports releasing approximately 3.3 million migrants into the United States through various pathways, including:
- Notices to Appear (NTA) in immigration court
- Parole programs
- Release on recognizance [5]

## Special Parole Programs

The Biden administration created several humanitarian parole programs:
- Over 500,000 individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) have arrived through the CHNV parole program as of mid-2024 [6]
- Approximately 200,000 Afghans were evacuated and paroled into the U.S. following the 2021 withdrawal [7]
- Over 180,000 Ukrainians have entered through the Uniting for Ukraine program [8]

## Total Estimates

Combining all categories, estimates suggest approximately 6-8 million immigrants have entered the United States under various statuses during the Biden presidency through 2024, though exact figures vary depending on methodology and which categories are included [9]. This includes legal permanent residents, refugees, parolees, asylum seekers released pending hearings, and those who entered without inspection.

It's important to note that these numbers include people with varying legal statuses - from permanent residents to those in removal proceedings - and don't necessarily represent permanent additions to the U.S. population, as some may ultimately depart voluntarily or be removed.
