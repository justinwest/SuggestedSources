Immigration flows under the Biden presidency have been substantial and complex, involving multiple categories of migrants and various legal pathways. From January 2021 through fiscal year 2024, millions of people have entered the United States through different channels.

## Border Encounters and Releases

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported approximately 10 million encounters at U.S. borders from February 2021 through September 2024 [1]. However, encounters do not equal individual immigrants, as the same person can be encountered multiple times. The Department of Homeland Security estimates that roughly 2.5 million individuals were released into the United States after border encounters from January 2021 through September 2023 [2].

## Legal Immigration Pathways

During fiscal years 2021-2023, the United States admitted approximately:
- 2.2 million lawful permanent residents (green card holders) [3]
- Over 1 million temporary workers and their families through various visa programs [3]
- Approximately 500,000 international students annually [3]

## Humanitarian Programs

The Biden administration has implemented several humanitarian programs:
- Over 400,000 individuals from Ukraine, Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela have arrived through specific parole programs as of early 2024 [4]
- Approximately 150,000 Afghan evacuees were resettled following the 2021 withdrawal [5]
- The refugee admissions program admitted about 60,000 refugees in FY 2023, up from historic lows during the previous administration [3]

## Total Estimates

Combining all categories, credible estimates suggest that between 8-10 million foreign nationals have entered and remained in the United States under some form of legal status or pending immigration proceedings since January 2021 [2][4]. This includes those released pending immigration hearings, legal immigrants, temporary visa holders, and humanitarian parolees.

It's important to note that these numbers include various categories with different legal statuses, and not all individuals who enter ultimately remain permanently in the United States. Many temporary visa holders, for instance, are expected to depart when their visas expire.
