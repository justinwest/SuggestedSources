Determining the exact number of immigrants who "entered" the United States under President Joe Biden's administration (from January 20, 2021, to the present) is complex, as it depends on definitions of "immigrants" and "entered." Official data from U.S. government agencies like Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) typically distinguish between several categories:

- **Legal permanent residents (LPRs or green card holders)**: Individuals granted lawful permanent residency through family, employment, diversity lottery, or other visas.
- **Temporary admissions**: Nonimmigrants on visas for work, study, tourism, etc., who are not considered permanent immigrants but may enter and stay temporarily.
- **Border encounters and releases**: Migrants encountered at the southwest border, including those apprehended, expelled, paroled, or released into the U.S. pending immigration proceedings (e.g., via asylum claims or parole programs). Not all encounters result in entry; some are turned away or expelled under Title 42 (used extensively until May 2023).
- **Humanitarian parole and other programs**: Special initiatives allowing temporary entry for specific groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians, and those under the Cuba-Haiti-Nicaragua-Venezuela (CHNV) program.

Comprehensive totals are not always aggregated in a single official figure, and estimates vary by source due to differing methodologies, time frames, and political perspectives. Conservative sources often emphasize higher numbers by including border releases and parolees as "immigrants," while neutral analyses focus on legal pathways and distinguish between entries and encounters. Based on available data up to fiscal year (FY) 2024 (ending September 30, 2024), here's a breakdown of key figures. Note that Biden's term is ongoing, so numbers will increase; these are estimates through late 2024.

### Legal Permanent Residents (Green Cards)
Approximately 3.3 million individuals obtained lawful permanent resident status from FY 2021 through FY 2023, with an additional ~1 million projected for FY 2024 based on trends [4]. This includes family-sponsored immigrants, employment-based visas, refugees/asylees, and diversity visa recipients. These figures represent adjustments of status or new arrivals but do not include all temporary entries.

### Temporary Nonimmigrant Admissions
Tens of millions enter annually on temporary visas (e.g., H-1B for skilled workers, B-1/B-2 for tourists/business, F-1 for students). From 2021 to 2023, nonimmigrant admissions totaled over 100 million, but this includes multiple entries by the same individuals and is not typically counted as "immigration" since most depart [5]. Excluding short-term visitors, key temporary worker and student visas issued numbered around 2-3 million per year under Biden, similar to pre-pandemic levels [4].

### Border Encounters and Entries
CBP reported over 10 million migrant encounters at the southwest border from FY 2021 through FY 2024 (specifically: 1.7 million in FY 2021, 2.4 million in FY 2022, 2.5 million in FY 2023, and ~2.5 million in FY 2024) [6]. However:
- Not all encounters lead to entry; about 4.5 million were expelled or removed under Title 42 or other measures [1][6].
- Approximately 5-6 million were processed and allowed entry or release into the U.S., including ~3 million released pending asylum hearings or under parole [2][6]. This includes "got-aways" (estimated at 1.8 million undetected crossings from FY 2021-2024) [1], though these are not officially "entered" via legal processes.
- Conservative estimates, such as from House Republicans, claim over 10 million "illegal immigrants" entered under Biden, including encounters, releases, and got-aways [1].

### Humanitarian Parole Programs
Biden expanded parole authority, allowing temporary entry for humanitarian reasons:
- The CHNV program (launched in 2023) has admitted ~530,000 individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela through October 2024 [2][3][7].
- Afghan evacuees: ~90,000 paroled in 2021-2022 [3].
- Ukrainians: ~170,000 under Uniting for Ukraine (2022-2024) [3][7].
- Total parole entries under Biden: Approximately 1.5-3 million, depending on inclusion of smaller programs and border parole [2][3]. One analysis questions the higher end of this range, noting that not all paroles result in permanent status and some figures may double-count [2].

### Overall Estimates
- **Conservative total**: Sources critical of Biden's policies estimate 10-12 million immigrants entered, combining legal pathways (~4 million LPRs), temporary admissions, border releases (~5-6 million), parolees (~3 million), and got-aways (~2 million) [1][2].
- **Neutral/moderate total**: Focusing on those who legally entered or were admitted (excluding expulsions and temporary visitors), estimates range from 7-9 million, including ~4 million LPRs, ~1-2 million key temporary visas, and ~2-3 million border/parole admissions [3][4][5].
- **Official DHS/CBP focus**: Emphasizes encounters (10+ million) rather than a single "entry" number, with ~3.5 million removals/expulsions offsetting some entries [6][7].

These figures reflect a surge in border encounters compared to prior administrations, driven by global migration trends, policy changes (e.g., ending Title 42), and expanded legal pathways [3]. However, legal immigration levels have returned to pre-COVID norms, and Biden has implemented restrictions like asylum limits in 2024 to reduce entries [3][7]. For the most current data, refer to official government reports, as partisan sources may inflate or understate based on perspective.
