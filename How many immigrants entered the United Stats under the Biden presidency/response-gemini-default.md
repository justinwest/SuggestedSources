The question of how many immigrants entered the United States under the Biden presidency is complex, as there is no single, all-encompassing statistic. The total number depends on the definition of "immigrant," which can include individuals who gained permanent legal status, those who entered on a temporary or humanitarian basis, and those who entered without authorization.

To provide a comprehensive answer, the numbers are broken down into several key categories based on the most recent official data available. The Biden administration began on January 20, 2021. Most government data is tracked by fiscal year (FY), which runs from October 1 to September 30.

### 1. Lawful Permanent Residents (Green Card Holders)

This is the most traditional definition of an immigrant. These are individuals granted the legal right to live and work permanently in the U.S.

*   **FY 2021 (partial Biden administration):** 740,002 individuals became lawful permanent residents [1].
*   **FY 2022:** 1,018,349 individuals became lawful permanent residents [1].
*   **FY 2023:** Data is still being compiled, but the numbers are expected to be similar to or higher than FY 2022 as processing backlogs from the COVID-19 pandemic continue to clear [2].

It is important to note that many of these individuals were already living in the U.S. on other visas and adjusted their status to permanent resident.

### 2. Southwest Border Encounters

This is the most widely cited figure in discussions about immigration, but it requires careful interpretation. An "encounter" is an event where a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer apprehends a person trying to enter between official ports of entry or finds a person to be inadmissible at a port of entry. This number does not represent the number of unique individuals who entered the country, as one person can be counted multiple times if they attempt to cross more than once (a high recidivism rate). It also does not mean all these individuals were released into the U.S.; many are expelled or detained.

*   **FY 2021:** 1,734,686 encounters [3].
*   **FY 2022:** 2,378,944 encounters [3].
*   **FY 2023:** 2,475,669 encounters [3].
*   **FY 2024 (through April 2024):** 1,586,816 encounters [3].

These figures represent record highs in the number of encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border.

### 3. Humanitarian Parole Programs

The Biden administration has made significant use of humanitarian parole, a discretionary authority that allows individuals to enter and remain in the U.S. temporarily for urgent humanitarian reasons.

*   **Afghans:** Following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, approximately 76,000 Afghans were brought to the U.S. under parole through Operation Allies Welcome [4].
*   **Ukrainians:** Through the "Uniting for Ukraine" program launched in April 2022, more than 195,000 Ukrainians had been paroled into the U.S. as of May 2024 [5].
*   **Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (CHNV):** This parole process, established in late 2022 and early 2023, allows up to 30,000 individuals per month from these countries to enter. As of April 2024, more than 434,800 individuals from these nations had arrived lawfully under this program [6].

### 4. Refugee and Asylee Admissions

*   **Refugees:** These are individuals who are admitted from abroad after being vetted and determined to be unable to return to their home country. Refugee admissions were historically low at the start of the administration but have been increasing.
    *   **FY 2021:** 11,411 (The lowest number in the program's history) [7].
    *   **FY 2022:** 25,465 [7].
    *   **FY 2023:** 60,014 [7].
*   **Asylees:** These are individuals who arrive in the U.S. and are subsequently granted protection because they have a credible fear of persecution in their home country. This data is harder to track in real time due to immense backlogs in immigration courts. In **FY 2022**, 28,159 individuals were granted asylum, but this reflects cases that may have been pending for years [1]. The number of pending asylum cases has grown to over 1 million under the Biden administration [2].

### 5. Estimated "Gotaways"

This unofficial term refers to individuals who CBP believes entered the U.S. without authorization and were detected (e.g., by sensors or cameras) but were not apprehended. These are estimates based on available surveillance and are less precise than encounter data.

*   DHS estimates indicate there were approximately **391,000** gotaways in FY 2021, **606,000** in FY 2022, and **670,000** in FY 2023 [8].

### Summary

It is impossible to provide a single number for how many immigrants entered the U.S. under the Biden presidency. However, by combining the different categories, a clearer picture emerges:

*   **Legal Permanent Immigration:** Over 1.75 million people have received green cards (FY21-FY22).
*   **Humanitarian Parole:** Well over 700,000 individuals have entered through special parole programs for Afghans, Ukrainians, and CHNV nationals.
*   **Border Encounters:** There have been over 8 million encounters at the southwest border, though this is not a count of unique individuals or successful entries.
*   **Refugees:** Nearly 100,000 refugees were admitted (FY21-FY23).

The period has been characterized by a combination of rebuilding legal immigration pathways that slowed during the pandemic, while simultaneously facing an unprecedented number of arrivals at the southern border, which the administration has managed through a mix of enforcement, expulsion policies, and the creation of new parole programs.
