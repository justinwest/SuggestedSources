Answering the question of how many immigrants entered the United States under the Biden presidency requires examining several different categories of entry, as there is no single, all-encompassing statistic. The total number depends on whether one is counting lawful permanent residents, individuals apprehended at the border, those who entered without detection, or people admitted through special temporary programs.

Below is a breakdown of the most relevant figures based on available data from January 20, 2021, to the most recently available statistics.

### 1. Encounters at the U.S. Border

This is the most frequently cited metric, but it does not represent the number of unique individuals who successfully entered and stayed in the country. "Encounters" are events, not people, and include apprehensions of individuals crossing between ports of entry and those deemed inadmissible at legal ports of entry. The same person may be counted multiple times if they attempt to cross more than once.

*   **Southwest Border Encounters (Fiscal Years):**
    *   **FY 2021:** 1,734,686 (The fiscal year began under the Trump administration, but the majority of encounters occurred after January 2021) [1].
    *   **FY 2022:** 2,378,944 [1].
    *   **FY 2023:** 2,475,669 [1].
    *   **FY 2024 (October 2023 - April 2024):** 1,586,819 [1].

    **Total Southwest Border Encounters (Feb 2021 - April 2024): Over 7.8 million** [1].

It is critical to note that during much of this period (until May 2023), the Title 42 public health order was in effect. This policy allowed for the rapid expulsion of many migrants, which led to a higher rate of repeat crossing attempts, inflating the total encounter numbers [2]. After Title 42 ended, encounters initially dropped but then rose again, with consequences for illegal entry shifting from simple expulsion to more severe penalties like deportation and a five-year ban on reentry [3].

### 2. Known "Gotaways"

"Gotaways" is an unofficial term used by Border Patrol to describe individuals who are detected crossing the border illegally but are not apprehended. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provides official estimates for this group.

*   **Estimated "Gotaways" (Fiscal Years):**
    *   **FY 2021:** 389,155 [4].
    *   **FY 2022:** 606,131 [4].
    *   **FY 2023:** 670,674 [4].

    **Total Estimated "Gotaways" (FY 2021 - FY 2023): Over 1.6 million** [4].

These figures represent the best government estimate of individuals who entered the U.S. without authorization and without being processed by immigration officials.

### 3. Lawful Permanent Residents (Green Card Holders)

This category includes individuals who were granted lawful permanent residence. These are the people most traditionally defined as "immigrants." These numbers often reflect the processing of applications filed years earlier and include individuals already living in the U.S. on other visas.

*   **New Lawful Permanent Residents (Fiscal Years):**
    *   **FY 2021:** 740,002 [5].
    *   **FY 2022:** 1,018,349 [5].
    *   **FY 2023:** 1,089,836 (preliminary) [6].

    **Total New Green Card Holders (FY 2021 - FY 2023): Approximately 2.85 million** [5, 6].

### 4. Humanitarian Parole and Other Legal Pathways

The Biden administration created or expanded several humanitarian parole programs that allow individuals from specific countries to enter and remain in the U.S. temporarily. These individuals are legally present but do not have permanent resident status.

*   **Uniting for Ukraine:** As of May 2024, more than 201,000 Ukrainians have been granted parole to enter the U.S. under this program and other pathways since 2022 [7].
*   **CHNV Parole Process (Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans):** From the program's start in late 2022/early 2023 through April 2024, approximately 434,800 nationals from these four countries were granted parole and have arrived in the U.S. [8].
*   **CBP One App:** This mobile application allows migrants in Mexico to schedule appointments at ports of entry to be processed in an orderly fashion. From its introduction in January 2023 through April 2024, over 592,000 individuals have scheduled appointments using the app [8].

### Summary

To provide a comprehensive answer, it is best to separate the categories:

*   **Border Encounters:** Over **7.8 million** encounters have occurred at the Southwest border since February 2021, though this figure includes repeat crossers and those who were expelled.
*   **Irregular Immigration (Successful Entries):** An estimated **1.6 million+** "gotaways" have entered without being apprehended since FY 2021. This number, combined with those released into the country after being apprehended, represents the population of new undocumented immigrants.
*   **Lawful Permanent Immigration:** Approximately **2.85 million** people became lawful permanent residents (received green cards) in FY 2021, 2022, and 2023.
*   **Parole and Special Programs:** Over **1.2 million** individuals have been processed into the country through new legal pathways like the Uniting for Ukraine program, the CHNV parole process, and the CBP One app.

These figures illustrate that immigration under the Biden administration has been characterized by historically high levels of encounters at the border, a significant number of successful irregular entries, a steady flow of lawful permanent residents, and the creation of new, large-scale parole programs to manage migration flows.
