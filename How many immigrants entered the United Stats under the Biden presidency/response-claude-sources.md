The number of immigrants who entered the United States under the Biden presidency varies significantly depending on how "immigrants" are defined and which data sources are used. The Biden administration, which began in January 2021, has overseen a complex period of immigration with multiple entry pathways and categories.

## Overall Immigration Numbers

According to Department of Homeland Security data, approximately 10 million encounters occurred at U.S. borders between fiscal years 2021-2024 under the Biden administration [1]. However, encounters do not equal unique individuals, as some people are encountered multiple times, and not all encounters result in entry into the United States.

The Migration Policy Institute reports that the Biden administration has presided over record-high immigration levels, with both legal and unauthorized immigration reaching historic numbers [2]. The total foreign-born population in the United States reached approximately 47.8 million by 2023, representing about 14.3% of the total U.S. population [3].

## Unauthorized Immigration

The Pew Research Center estimates that the unauthorized immigrant population living in the United States reached a record 14 million in 2023, up from approximately 10.5 million in 2019 [4]. This represents an increase of roughly 3.5 million during the Biden presidency, though not all of these individuals necessarily entered during this period.

## Legal Immigration and Parole Programs

The Biden administration has utilized various parole programs extensively. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, nearly 3 million individuals were paroled into the United States under Biden's presidency through various programs [5]. These include:

- The Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan (CHNV) parole program, which allowed up to 30,000 individuals per month
- Afghan evacuees following the withdrawal from Afghanistan (approximately 80,000)
- Ukrainian refugees under the Uniting for Ukraine program (over 200,000)

Legal permanent resident admissions have averaged approximately 1 million per year during the Biden administration, consistent with pre-pandemic levels [2].

## Border Encounters and Releases

House Committee on Homeland Security data indicates that millions of encounters at the southern border resulted in various outcomes, including removals, returns, and releases into the United States [1]. The exact number of individuals who successfully entered and remained in the country is difficult to determine due to factors such as:

- Multiple encounters of the same individuals
- "Gotaways" (individuals who evaded detection)
- Various legal statuses and pending immigration proceedings

## Total Estimate

Combining various categories, a conservative estimate suggests that between 5-7 million immigrants (including both authorized and unauthorized) have entered and remained in the United States during the Biden presidency. This includes legal permanent residents, parolees, asylum seekers, and unauthorized entries. However, precise figures remain contested due to data limitations and definitional differences.
