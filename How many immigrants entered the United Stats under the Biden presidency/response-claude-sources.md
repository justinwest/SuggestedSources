The number of immigrants who entered the United States during the Biden presidency varies significantly depending on how "immigrants" is defined and which data sources are used. The Biden administration, which began in January 2021, has overseen a complex period of immigration marked by both increased border encounters and expanded legal pathways.

## Border Encounters and Apprehensions

According to official data, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded approximately 7.8 million encounters at the southern border from February 2021 through September 2024 [1]. However, it's important to note that encounters do not equal unique individuals, as the same person can be encountered multiple times. The actual number of unique individuals is lower, though precise figures are disputed.

## Legal Immigration Pathways

The Biden administration has significantly expanded the use of humanitarian parole programs. According to analysis from the Center for Immigration Studies, the administration paroled nearly 3 million foreign nationals into the United States through various programs between January 2021 and early 2024 [2]. This includes approximately:

- 1.45 million individuals paroled at the southwest border
- 530,000 through the CBP One app program
- 357,000 Ukrainians through Uniting for Ukraine
- 477,000 through the CHNV program (Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela) [2]

## Total Immigration Numbers

The Migration Policy Institute notes that the Biden administration has presided over both record-high unauthorized border crossings and the expansion of legal pathways [3]. When combining various forms of entry, including:
- Legal permanent residents (green card holders)
- Temporary visa holders
- Parolees
- Asylum seekers
- Those who entered without authorization

The total number of immigrants who entered during the Biden presidency likely exceeds 10 million people, though exact figures depend on definitions and data sources [4][5].

## Important Context

Several factors complicate precise counting:
1. Many encounters at the border result in immediate expulsion or removal
2. Some individuals are counted multiple times in encounter statistics
3. Not all who enter remain in the United States
4. Different agencies and organizations use varying methodologies for counting

The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Immigration Statistics reported that fiscal year 2023 saw approximately 3.1 million total encounters, with about 2.5 million at the Southwest border [1]. However, these figures include repeat crossers and those who were immediately expelled.
