# What are the externalities of immigration?

Immigration creates externalities, which are consequences that affect third parties not directly involved in the transaction between the immigrant and their employer or the state. These effects are often difficult to measure and are not captured by direct economic indicators like wages or GDP. The externalities of immigration can be both negative and positive, and their net impact often depends on the skill level of the immigrants, the scale of the inflow, and the policies of the host country [3].

### Negative Externalities
The provided sources primarily focus on the negative externalities, particularly those associated with low-skilled or large-scale immigration.

*   **Fiscal Costs and Strain on Public Services**: Low-skilled immigrants may contribute less in taxes than they consume in public services such as healthcare, education, and social welfare benefits. This can create a net fiscal burden on the native population, especially at local and state levels [3]. Furthermore, a rapid increase in population can strain the capacity of public infrastructure like schools, hospitals, and transportation systems, leading to a decline in service quality or a need for costly public investment [1, 3].
*   **Congestion and Housing Costs**: Immigration increases the demand for housing, which can drive up property prices and rents, particularly in urban areas where immigrants tend to settle. This makes housing less affordable for the existing population. Similarly, increased population density can lead to greater congestion on roads and public transport [1, 3].
*   **Reduced Social Cohesion and Trust**: Large-scale immigration, especially from culturally distant countries, can lead to a reduction in social trust and cohesion. Research, notably by political scientist Robert Putnam, has suggested that in the short-to-medium term, ethnic diversity can be associated with lower levels of trust both between and within ethnic groups [3]. This can weaken civic engagement and community bonds.
*   **Political Shifts**: Immigrant groups often have different political preferences and voting patterns than the native population. Over time, this can shift the political landscape of the host country in ways that may not align with the preferences of the existing citizenry, representing a political externality [3].
*   **Crime Rates**: Some research suggests that certain immigrant groups have higher rates of crime than the native-born population, creating a significant social cost for victims and for the justice system. However, this is a highly contentious area of study, with data varying significantly by country, immigrant group, and methodology [3].
*   **Importation of Institutional Norms**: There is a concern that immigrants from countries with high levels of corruption and low levels of social trust may bring these institutional norms with them. This could potentially degrade the quality of institutions in the host country over the long term [3].

### Positive Externalities
While the provided sources emphasize negative externalities, a comprehensive view includes positive ones, which are often cited in economic and sociological literature.

*   **Innovation and Entrepreneurship**: Immigrants, particularly those who are high-skilled, contribute significantly to innovation. Studies have shown they are disproportionately likely to file patents and contribute to scientific and technological advancements [4]. Immigrants across the skill spectrum also have high rates of entrepreneurship, starting businesses that create jobs and offer new goods and services, from tech startups to restaurants and retail shops [5].
*   **Demographic Rejuvenation**: In many developed countries with aging populations and low birth rates, immigration provides a demographic boost. Younger immigrants and their children expand the labor force and tax base, which helps fund public services and social security systems for a growing elderly population [6].
*   **Cultural Enrichment**: Immigrants introduce new foods, music, traditions, and perspectives that can enrich the cultural life of the host society. This diversity can increase the "amenity value" of cities and neighborhoods, making them more vibrant and attractive places to live [5].
*   **Economic Dynamism and Labor Market Flexibility**: Immigrants often fill labor shortages at both the high and low ends of the skill spectrum, making the economy more efficient and flexible. They take on jobs that may be difficult to fill with native workers, such as in agriculture or elder care, allowing the economy to produce goods and services that might otherwise be unfeasible [4, 6].

The author Lorenzo from Oz argues that mainstream social science often fails to account for these broader externalities, focusing instead on narrow, measurable effects like wages. He contends that these unmeasured costs—such as impacts on social trust, congestion, and public services—are substantial and likely outweigh the small economic benefits often cited in conventional studies, especially in the case of low-skilled immigration [1, 2].

    *   This source expresses the view that immigration boosts economic growth by contributing to human capital and innovation. It argues that immigrants typically have a neutral to positive fiscal impact and contribute positively by filling labor market needs and fostering entrepreneurship.
