# What are the externalities of immigration?

Immigration creates a range of externalities – spillover effects on economies and societies that go beyond the direct benefits to migrants and employers. **Economic externalities:** An influx of workers can affect wages and employment for natives. Low-skilled immigration tends to increase competition for low-wage jobs, which benefits businesses and consumers but can depress earnings for comparable native workers ([www.thesocialcontract.com](https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_27_3/tsc-27-3-elbel.shtml#:~:text=Borjas%20understands%20that%20there%20are,at%20lower%20wages)) ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=The%20non,like%20a%20particularly%20strong%20point)). In other words, immigration produces winners (employers, and often high-skill natives) and losers (primarily low-skill natives in competition) ([www.thesocialcontract.com](https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_27_3/tsc-27-3-elbel.shtml#:~:text=Borjas%20understands%20that%20there%20are,at%20lower%20wages)). These distributional impacts mean the overall net economic gain from immigration may be modest, as much of the “gain” is a transfer from labor to owners of capital ([www.thesocialcontract.com](https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_27_3/tsc-27-3-elbel.shtml#:~:text=Borjas%20understands%20that%20there%20are,at%20lower%20wages)). On the other hand, high-skilled immigrants often have positive external effects: they spur innovation, entrepreneurship, and productivity. For example, studies in the U.S. find that skilled immigrants contributed significantly to increases in patenting and technological innovation over recent decades ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/03/skilled-immigration-innovation-firms/#:~:text=Recent%20contributions%20focus%20on%20the,among%20immigrants%20than%20among%20natives)). A larger population through immigration can also expand consumer demand and specialization. However, simply adding people doesn’t guarantee higher living standards – countries with bigger populations aren’t automatically richer per capita ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=The%20first%20reason%20is%20that,slightly%20negative%2C%20in%20fact)) ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=Which%20raises%20the%20question%3A%20if,will%20quote%20in%20its%20entirety)). As one analyst quips, “additional people” are not inherently an economic boon unless they bring skills or fill specific needs ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=The%20first%20reason%20is%20that,slightly%20negative%2C%20in%20fact)). Immigration’s effect thus depends on who the immigrants are (their skill levels, education, etc.) and how they fit into the host economy ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=,be%20bad%20for%20the%20economy)) ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=I%20want%20to%20reiterate%20that,it%20involves%20permanent%20settlement%20etc)).  

Another economic externality concerns public finances. Lower-skilled immigrants often pay less in taxes than they consume in government services, especially in generous welfare states. This can impose fiscal burdens on taxpayers over time ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=the%20negative%20fiscal%20effect%20%E2%80%93,the%20rate%20of%20native%20Danes)) ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=What%E2%80%99s%20more%2C%20even%20if%20low,net%20recipients%20of%20public%20money)). For instance, long-term studies in some European countries show certain refugee or low-skill immigrant groups with persistently low employment rates, resulting in significant net costs per person in social benefits ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=the%20negative%20fiscal%20effect%20%E2%80%93,the%20rate%20of%20native%20Danes)). By contrast, highly skilled immigrants tend to be net fiscal contributors. The net fiscal impact thus varies widely by immigrant group and host-country policies. Immigration also affects housing, infrastructure, and local prices. Rapid population growth without adequate housing supply drives up rents and home prices – a classic side-effect seen when governments densely regulate land use yet admit many newcomers ([www.lorenzofromoz.net](https://www.lorenzofromoz.net/p/marx-was-neither-an-economist-nor#:~:text=The%20use%20of%20regulation%20to,production%20nor%20of%20private%20property)). Congested public transit or schools in fast-growing cities are other local externalities. Some economists note that readily available cheap immigrant labor can even slow productivity growth in certain sectors by reducing the incentive to invest in automation or training ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=What%E2%80%99s%20more%2C%20specialisation%20and%20trade,say%2C%20the%20robot%20vacuum%20cleaner)) ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=,from%20Africa%20and%20the%20Middle)). For example, a Dutch analysis found that an abundance of inexpensive foreign farm workers delayed innovation in agriculture, and that population increase itself carries costs (e.g. congestion or environmental strain) in a small, densely populated country ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=,from%20Africa%20and%20the%20Middle)). In short, the economic externalities of immigration include a complex mix of gains in efficiency and innovation alongside redistributive effects, fiscal pressures, and adjustment costs in local markets. 

**Social externalities:** Immigration – especially when it leads to greater ethnic diversity – can affect social cohesion, civic engagement, and trust within communities. In the short run, higher diversity has been linked to lower social capital. People in more heterogeneous neighborhoods tend to trust each other (even their own neighbors) less and participate less in community life ([www.scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-diversity-create-distrust/#:~:text=living%20in%20a%20racially%20diverse,diversity%20with%20each%20passing%20decade)) ([www.worldsupporter.org](https://www.worldsupporter.org/en/summary/e-pluribus-unum-diversity-and-community-twenty-first-century-putnam-2007-article-84876#:~:text=There%20are%20several%20scientific%20confirmations,others%2C%20regardless%20of%20their%20ethnicity)). The political scientist Robert Putnam famously found that Americans “hunker down” in response to diversity: they become more socially isolated, reducing inter-personal trust and even reticence toward civic endeavors like voting, volunteering, or charity ([www.scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-diversity-create-distrust/#:~:text=living%20in%20a%20racially%20diverse,diversity%20with%20each%20passing%20decade)) ([www.worldsupporter.org](https://www.worldsupporter.org/en/summary/e-pluribus-unum-diversity-and-community-twenty-first-century-putnam-2007-article-84876#:~:text=There%20are%20several%20scientific%20confirmations,others%2C%20regardless%20of%20their%20ethnicity)). Notably, this effect applied both toward outsiders and within groups – in very diverse settings, people were less likely to trust even those of their own ethnicity ([www.worldsupporter.org](https://www.worldsupporter.org/en/summary/e-pluribus-unum-diversity-and-community-twenty-first-century-putnam-2007-article-84876#:~:text=the%20degree%20of%20confidence%2C%20the,is%20called%20the%20%27constrict%27%20hypothesis)) ([www.worldsupporter.org](https://www.worldsupporter.org/en/summary/e-pluribus-unum-diversity-and-community-twenty-first-century-putnam-2007-article-84876#:~:text=There%20are%20several%20scientific%20confirmations,that%20people%20withdraw%20from%20the)). Putnam characterized this as a downside of diversity in the near term ([www.worldsupporter.org](https://www.worldsupporter.org/en/summary/e-pluribus-unum-diversity-and-community-twenty-first-century-putnam-2007-article-84876#:~:text=discussed,the%20negative%20effects%20of%20diversity)). Other research confirms that measures of social cohesion (confidence in local institutions, rates of community cooperation, friendship networks, etc.) tend to be lower in highly diverse communities ([www.worldsupporter.org](https://www.worldsupporter.org/en/summary/e-pluribus-unum-diversity-and-community-twenty-first-century-putnam-2007-article-84876#:~:text=There%20are%20several%20scientific%20confirmations,others%2C%20regardless%20of%20their%20ethnicity)). One interpretation is that rapid demographic change can “constrict” social networks, at least until new forms of solidarity are built ([www.worldsupporter.org](https://www.worldsupporter.org/en/summary/e-pluribus-unum-diversity-and-community-twenty-first-century-putnam-2007-article-84876#:~:text=the%20degree%20of%20confidence%2C%20the,is%20called%20the%20%27constrict%27%20hypothesis)) ([www.worldsupporter.org](https://www.worldsupporter.org/en/summary/e-pluribus-unum-diversity-and-community-twenty-first-century-putnam-2007-article-84876#:~:text=discussed,the%20negative%20effects%20of%20diversity)). People may withdraw socially when they feel they have little in common with their neighbors. Cultural and language barriers can impede the casual interactions that build trust. These social externalities are not necessarily permanent – over the long run, integration and interaction can gradually create new shared identities (a “bridging” social capital) that counteract the initial dip in cohesion ([www.worldsupporter.org](https://www.worldsupporter.org/en/summary/e-pluribus-unum-diversity-and-community-twenty-first-century-putnam-2007-article-84876#:~:text=discussed,the%20negative%20effects%20of%20diversity)). Indeed, multi-ethnic nations often eventually develop broader identities and norms that encompass newcomers. But the interim period can involve real frictions in community life.

Importantly, some analysts argue that the observed decline in social trust amid diversity is driven less by *immigrants’* behavior than by natives’ reactions. For example, one re-analysis of Putnam’s data suggested the trust deficit in mixed neighborhoods was largely due to majority-group individuals feeling uneasy or “culturally distant,” rather than minorities self-segregating ([www.scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-diversity-create-distrust/#:~:text=Sociologists%20Maria%20Abascal%2C%20of%20Princeton,how%20Whites%20feel%20when%20living)). Lorenzo Warby similarly posits that what might appear as “racism” in hiring or neighborly attitudes can often be explained by **cultural distance** – differences in language, customs or social norms that make people uncertain about others’ behavior ([www.lorenzofromoz.net](https://www.lorenzofromoz.net/p/there-is-significant-discrimination#:~:text=The%20patterns%20of%20discrimination%20identified,is%20patterns%20of%20cultural%20distance)) ([www.lorenzofromoz.net](https://www.lorenzofromoz.net/p/there-is-significant-discrimination#:~:text=The%20study%20provides%20other%20evidence,the%20issue%20is%20cultural%20distance)). In his view, people tend to be more comfortable and civic-minded among those with similar cultural habits, and sudden diversity can reduce that comfort level without any ill intent ([www.lorenzofromoz.net](https://www.lorenzofromoz.net/p/there-is-significant-discrimination#:~:text=be%20the%20main%20factor,the%20issue%20is%20cultural%20distance)) ([www.lorenzofromoz.net](https://www.lorenzofromoz.net/p/there-is-significant-discrimination#:~:text=Racism%20is%20a%20pattern%20of,information%20to%20form%20robust%20expectations)). This can manifest in subtle externalities like natives self-sorting out of diverse areas. Studies in Western countries have noted “compositional amenity” effects – essentially, some long-time residents move away from neighborhoods that receive large inflows of immigrants, preferring more familiar surroundings ([www.lorenzofromoz.net](https://www.lorenzofromoz.net/p/there-is-significant-discrimination#:~:text=As%20I%20have%20previously%20noted%2C,by%20cultural%20incomprehension%20and%20contempt)). Warby interprets this as a loss of local social capital: tight-knit communities loosen when demographic turnover is high ([www.lorenzofromoz.net](https://www.lorenzofromoz.net/p/there-is-significant-discrimination#:~:text=As%20I%20have%20previously%20noted%2C,by%20cultural%20incomprehension%20and%20contempt)). The departure of established residents (sometimes termed “white flight” in the U.S. context) can strain the remaining community’s institutions and erode cross-group interactions. In short, even absent overt prejudice, diversity can introduce coordination challenges and fray social bonds in the short term. These are classic externalities: individual families choose where to live or whom to befriend, but collectively those choices can alter the social fabric of a town or school. Over time, increased inter-ethnic contact *can* also produce positive externalities like greater cultural literacy, tolerance, and cosmopolitan networks – the upside of immigration that enriches a society – but the transition may be bumpy ([www.worldsupporter.org](https://www.worldsupporter.org/en/summary/e-pluribus-unum-diversity-and-community-twenty-first-century-putnam-2007-article-84876#:~:text=discussed,the%20negative%20effects%20of%20diversity)).

**Cultural and political externalities:** Beyond economics and local community life, immigration can have broad cultural and institutional impacts. Migrants bring their languages, religions, and social norms with them, transforming the cultural landscape of the host country. This can be enriching (e.g. new cuisines, arts, and perspectives) but also a source of tension if newcomers’ values clash with natives’. In moderate doses, societies often absorb and adapt to cultural changes. However, at very large scales, immigration may fundamentally change a nation’s character, which is precisely the concern of some skeptics. For instance, economist Paul Collier noted that migrants “bring their culture with them,” and if *enough* people relocate from societies with very different institutions, they might inadvertently import the same dysfunctions that plagued their home countries ([www.thesocialcontract.com](https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_27_3/tsc-27-3-elbel.shtml#:~:text=,of%20billions%20of%20new%20persons)) ([www.thesocialcontract.com](https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_27_3/tsc-27-3-elbel.shtml#:~:text=Collier%20frankly%20summarizes%20the%20dilemma%3A,%E2%80%9D)). George Borjas makes a similar point: open borders on a massive scale could “turn upside down” the social and political fabric of receiving countries by sheer force of numbers ([www.thesocialcontract.com](https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_27_3/tsc-27-3-elbel.shtml#:~:text=Borjas%20contends%20that%20economic%20models,entire%20cultural%2C%20social%2C%20and%20political)) ([www.thesocialcontract.com](https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_27_3/tsc-27-3-elbel.shtml#:~:text=,of%20billions%20of%20new%20persons)). Essentially, host institutions – from schools and laws to norms of trust – might not be static in the face of demographic transformation. There is historical precedent: large immigrant diasporas can form parallel communities with their own customs (Chinatowns, Little Italys, etc.), which gradually integrate but in the interim alter the host society’s cultural makeup. High concentrations of newcomers can slow their assimilation as well, an externality that prolongs cultural gaps. Borjas emphasizes that immigrants are *people*, not just economic units, and “those choices [about how to live]…have repercussions and unintended consequences” for society at large ([www.thesocialcontract.com](https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_27_3/tsc-27-3-elbel.shtml#:~:text=Swiss%20novelist%20and%20playwright%20Max,%E2%80%9D%20Borjas%20writes%20that)). For example, if a critical mass of immigrants have illiberal views on, say, free speech or gender roles, this could influence local politics or norms over time ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=Yet%20another%20effect%20of%20low,on%20issues%20like%20free%20speech%E2%80%9D)). Surveys in Europe have found some immigrant groups (particularly low-skilled immigrants from conservative societies) hold different views on social issues and tend to support political parties that promise more generous welfare or intervention ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20not%20just%20free%20speech,in%20a%20more%20socialist%20direction)). Such voting patterns can shift a country’s policy landscape – an external effect not always anticipated by natives. In France, for instance, a large majority of Muslim immigrants and their descendants have voted for left-wing candidates, pushing politics in a more statist direction ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20not%20just%20free%20speech,in%20a%20more%20socialist%20direction)). At the same time, these demographic changes can provoke a native backlash in the opposite direction. Many voters react to rapid immigration by supporting anti-immigration or nationalist parties, which has been a notable trend across Europe ([www.lorenzofromoz.net](https://www.lorenzofromoz.net/p/there-is-significant-discrimination#:~:text=Commentary%20on%20the%20UK%E2%80%99s%202016,cultural%20condescension)) ([www.lorenzofromoz.net](https://www.lorenzofromoz.net/p/there-is-significant-discrimination#:~:text=Ironically%2C%20Brexit%20has%20deprived%20organised,populism%20sweep%20across%20the%20continent)). The rise of “populist” movements in Western democracies over the past decade is widely seen as partly a response to immigration and its perceived cultural impacts. Natives who feel their community identity is threatened may mobilize to restrict immigration – Brexit and the election of Donald Trump being two prominent examples where immigration was a central issue ([www.lorenzofromoz.net](https://www.lorenzofromoz.net/p/there-is-significant-discrimination#:~:text=behaviour%20on%20the%20basis%20of,for%20control%20of%20public%20discourse)) ([www.lorenzofromoz.net](https://www.lorenzofromoz.net/p/there-is-significant-discrimination#:~:text=Analysis%20of%20Trump%E2%80%99s%202016%20Electoral,and%20that%20mattered)). This feedback loop is itself an externality of immigration: it can alter host countries’ political equilibrium and policy priorities, sometimes in destabilizing ways.

Perhaps the most extreme cultural externality argument is the “**Great Replacement**” thesis espoused by French writer Renaud Camus and others ([demokracija.eu](https://demokracija.eu/focus/renaud-camus-global-replacism-is-not-only-an-ethnocide-or-genocide-by-substitution-it-is-also-ecocide/#:~:text=I%20recently%20learned%20the%20word,a%20massive%20change%20in%20civilization)). Camus argues that large-scale immigration, particularly from non-Western countries, amounts to an ethnic and civilizational takeover of Europe – essentially, the native population being replaced by newcomers. He describes it in dire terms as “not only an ethnocide, or genocide by substitution, but also an ecocide” – suggesting that the incoming populations will irrevocably destroy the heritage and even environment of the West ([demokracija.eu](https://demokracija.eu/focus/renaud-camus-global-replacism-is-not-only-an-ethnocide-or-genocide-by-substitution-it-is-also-ecocide/#:~:text=Renaud%20Camus%3A%20%E2%80%9CGlobal%20replacism%20is,%E2%80%9D)). Mainstream analysts consider this a conspiracy theory and an exaggeration, but its popularity in some circles underscores the perceived *cultural* externalities of immigration. Even if one rejects Camus’s framing, it’s true that immigration can change a country’s demographic makeup (for example, turning previously homogeneous nations multi-ethnic within a generation). Such change can be unsettling to those who fear the dilution of their national identity, language, or traditions. These fears, in turn, can influence social cohesion and politics – for instance, through stricter immigration laws or even hostility toward immigrant communities. Thus, whether real or imagined, the “externality” of cultural change looms large in debates about immigration.

**Externalities for origin countries:** While much focus is on host nations, immigration also produces spillovers for the countries migrants come from. A positive effect is **remittances** – money sent back home by immigrants. These cross-border transfers, amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars annually, have been shown to reduce poverty and spur development in many low-income nations. Families use remittances to pay for education, start businesses, and improve living standards, creating economic multipliers in the origin country. There are also knowledge transfers when expatriates bring new skills or start businesses back home. However, emigration can also entail **brain drain**. When many young, educated people leave a developing country, it may deprive the society of talent (like doctors, engineers, entrepreneurs), hindering growth. For smaller or struggling states, the loss of human capital is an unintended external cost of emigration. Additionally, some countries become reliant on emigration as a “safety valve” for unemployment, which can delay needed reforms at home. These externalities illustrate that migration’s impacts are a two-way street: the departure of people has ripple effects on those left behind, both beneficial and problematic. 

In sum, the externalities of immigration are diverse and significant. They include economic spillovers (from wage redistribution and innovation to fiscal and housing impacts), social consequences (shifts in trust, cohesion, and local networks), and cultural-political changes (evolving national identity and new voting dynamics). Many of these effects – positive or negative – are not borne by the immigrants themselves or the employers who hire them, but by the broader community. This is what makes them externalities: they are unintended side-effects of the movement of people across borders. Whether immigration’s externalities are viewed as on balance good or bad depends on one’s perspective and which effects are given most weight. Proponents emphasize the dynamism, growth, and enrichment that immigrants bring, while skeptics point to the strains on social fabric, public resources, and national coherence. The reality is a complex mixture of both. As one scholar put it, “we wanted workers, but we got people instead” ([www.thesocialcontract.com](https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_27_3/tsc-27-3-elbel.shtml#:~:text=Swiss%20novelist%20and%20playwright%20Max,%E2%80%9D%20Borjas%20writes%20that)) – immigrants arrive as full members of society, with all the associated influences on communities. Sound immigration policy, therefore, must grapple with these broader external impacts. By acknowledging externalities – from boosting innovation to taxing the welfare system or testing social trust – policymakers and citizens can more honestly evaluate how to maximize the benefits of immigration while mitigating its unintended costs ([www.thesocialcontract.com](https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_27_3/tsc-27-3-elbel.shtml#:~:text=,economic%20fabric%20of%20receiving%20countries)) ([www.thesocialcontract.com](https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_27_3/tsc-27-3-elbel.shtml#:~:text=We%20are%20now%20witnessing%20the,have%20been%20foisted%20upon%20America)). Only through such a balanced approach can societies harness immigration’s opportunities and address its challenges in a sustainable way.

1. **Lorenzo Warby – *“The Limits of Social Science” I & II (2023, Lorenzo from Oz blog*)** – Warby argues that social scientists often misinterpret the effects of immigration due to ideological biases. He contends that what is labeled “racism” in native populations is frequently a reaction to *cultural distance* – differences in language or norms between immigrants and natives. Warby points out that discrimination patterns in the West map more closely to cultural barriers than to skin color, implying that integration difficulties (not just prejudice) are a key externality of immigration ([www.lorenzofromoz.net](https://www.lorenzofromoz.net/p/there-is-significant-discrimination#:~:text=The%20patterns%20of%20discrimination%20identified,is%20patterns%20of%20cultural%20distance)) ([www.lorenzofromoz.net](https://www.lorenzofromoz.net/p/there-is-significant-discrimination#:~:text=The%20study%20provides%20other%20evidence,the%20issue%20is%20cultural%20distance)).

Overall, Warby’s view is that immigration can strain social capital and community trust, especially if policymakers ignore local cultural dynamics ([www.lorenzofromoz.net](https://www.lorenzofromoz.net/p/there-is-significant-discrimination#:~:text=As%20I%20have%20previously%20noted%2C,by%20cultural%20incomprehension%20and%20contempt)).

2. **Noah Carl – *“Externalities from Low-Skilled Migration” (2023, Aporia Magazine)*:** Carl maintains that low-skilled immigration tends to have *negative* long-run externalities on host countries. In his analysis, an influx of less-educated migrants may benefit the overall economy only slightly, while imposing costs on public finances and low-income natives ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=The%20non,like%20a%20particularly%20strong%20point)) ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=the%20negative%20fiscal%20effect%20%E2%80%93,the%20rate%20of%20native%20Danes)).

Carl also argues that a larger low-skilled population can slow technological adoption (by keeping labor cheap) and even influence institutions – for example, if immigrants from illiberal societies vote for policies that hinder economic freedom ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=What%E2%80%99s%20more%2C%20specialisation%20and%20trade,say%2C%20the%20robot%20vacuum%20cleaner)) ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=Yet%20another%20effect%20of%20low,on%20issues%20like%20free%20speech%E2%80%9D)). He contrasts this with high-skilled immigration, which he agrees is economically beneficial. In sum, Carl’s view is that not all immigration is equal: low-skilled migration can create significant negative externalities (fiscal, social, and political) that outweigh its modest economic gains ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=increase%20in%20support%20for%20the,they%E2%80%99re%20voting%20for%20Donald%20Trump)) ([www.aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/was-i-wrong-about-low-skilled-immigration#:~:text=more%20like%20North%20Africa%20will,good%20for%20the%20French%20economy)).

3. **George J. Borjas – *We Wanted Workers (2016)*:** Borjas, a Harvard labor economist, provides a nuanced view that immigration produces winners and losers in the host economy. He demonstrates that the net economic benefit (“immigration surplus”) is relatively small, because immigrants increase total output but also drive down wages for some natives ([www.thesocialcontract.com](https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_27_3/tsc-27-3-elbel.shtml#:~:text=,the%20greater%20the%20economic%20gain)). Employers and consumers gain from cheaper labor, while low-skill natives lose – a redistribution that often goes unacknowledged ([www.thesocialcontract.com](https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_27_3/tsc-27-3-elbel.shtml#:~:text=Borjas%20understands%20that%20there%20are,at%20lower%20wages)). Borjas emphasizes that immigrants are “not just workers, but people” with families, behaviors, and needs that create spillover effects ([www.thesocialcontract.com](https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_27_3/tsc-27-3-elbel.shtml#:~:text=Swiss%20novelist%20and%20playwright%20Max,%E2%80%9D%20Borjas%20writes%20that)). For example, large immigrant inflows can stress schools, welfare programs, and other institutions in ways economic models didn’t initially count ([www.thesocialcontract.com](https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_27_3/tsc-27-3-elbel.shtml#:~:text=,economic%20fabric%20of%20receiving%20countries)). He also warns of *social* externalities: if too many people enter a country too quickly, they may import cultural norms or political preferences that alter the host society’s fabric ([www.thesocialcontract.com](https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_27_3/tsc-27-3-elbel.shtml#:~:text=,of%20billions%20of%20new%20persons)). In Borjas’s view, past research overly focused on efficiency gains while downplaying these broader consequences. His famous line – “We wanted workers, but we got people instead” – encapsulates the idea that immigration’s impact extends well beyond the labor market ([www.thesocialcontract.com](https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_27_3/tsc-27-3-elbel.shtml#:~:text=Swiss%20novelist%20and%20playwright%20Max,%E2%80%9D%20Borjas%20writes%20that)).

4. **Green (2025) on Renaud Camus – *Analysis of the “Great Replacement”*:** This source examines French writer Renaud Camus’s argument that mass immigration constitutes a “Great Replacement” of native Europeans. Camus’s view is radically pessimistic: he describes ongoing immigration as an existential threat to French and European civilization, tantamount to “ethnocide or genocide by substitution” ([demokracija.eu](https://demokracija.eu/focus/renaud-camus-global-replacism-is-not-only-an-ethnocide-or-genocide-by-substitution-it-is-also-ecocide/#:~:text=Renaud%20Camus%3A%20%E2%80%9CGlobal%20replacism%20is,%E2%80%9D)). He asserts that the *most important phenomenon* of our era is the “massive change of population” in Western Europe leading to a “massive change in civilization” ([demokracija.eu](https://demokracija.eu/focus/renaud-camus-global-replacism-is-not-only-an-ethnocide-or-genocide-by-substitution-it-is-also-ecocide/#:~:text=I%20recently%20learned%20the%20word,a%20massive%20change%20in%20civilization)). Green’s analysis likely contextualizes Camus’s claims as a conspiracy theory and critiques its empirical basis. The “Great Replacement” narrative is presented as an extreme interpretation of immigration’s cultural externalities – one that sees virtually any demographic change as catastrophic. While mainstream researchers do not endorse Camus’s alarmist conclusions, this view has influenced far-right political movements, illustrating how cultural externalities (like fears of identity loss) can drive public discourse on immigration.

5. **Robert D. Putnam – *“E Pluribus Unum: Diversity and Community in the Twenty‐First Century” (2007)*:** Putnam’s landmark study examines how ethnic diversity affects social capital. Surveying approximately 30,000 Americans, he found that higher diversity in a community correlates with lower interpersonal trust and civic engagement ([www.scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-diversity-create-distrust/#:~:text=living%20in%20a%20racially%20diverse,diversity%20with%20each%20passing%20decade)). In more mixed neighborhoods, residents (including members of all ethnic groups) reported trusting their neighbors less, participating less in local groups, and volunteering less often ([www.scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-diversity-create-distrust/#:~:text=living%20in%20a%20racially%20diverse,diversity%20with%20each%20passing%20decade)) ([www.worldsupporter.org](https://www.worldsupporter.org/en/summary/e-pluribus-unum-diversity-and-community-twenty-first-century-putnam-2007-article-84876#:~:text=There%20are%20several%20scientific%20confirmations,others%2C%20regardless%20of%20their%20ethnicity)). Putnam termed this short-term effect the “constrict hypothesis”: in the face of diversity, people tend to hunker down and withdraw socially. He stressed that *both* in-group and out-group trust were reduced in highly diverse settings ([www.worldsupporter.org](https://www.worldsupporter.org/en/summary/e-pluribus-unum-diversity-and-community-twenty-first-century-putnam-2007-article-84876#:~:text=the%20degree%20of%20confidence%2C%20the,is%20called%20the%20%27constrict%27%20hypothesis)) ([www.worldsupporter.org](https://www.worldsupporter.org/en/summary/e-pluribus-unum-diversity-and-community-twenty-first-century-putnam-2007-article-84876#:~:text=There%20are%20several%20scientific%20confirmations,that%20people%20withdraw%20from%20the)) – meaning it wasn’t just inter-ethnic mistrust, but an overall collapse of social connectedness. However, Putnam also noted the *long-term* benefits of diversity and immigration. He argued that societies eventually find ways to bridge differences, creating new, more inclusive forms of social solidarity ([www.worldsupporter.org](https://www.worldsupporter.org/en/summary/e-pluribus-unum-diversity-and-community-twenty-first-century-putnam-2007-article-84876#:~:text=discussed,the%20negative%20effects%20of%20diversity)). His paper concludes that immigration is a net positive in the long run (bringing creativity, growth, and global ties), but it does pose a short-run challenge for community cohesion ([www.worldsupporter.org](https://www.worldsupporter.org/en/summary/e-pluribus-unum-diversity-and-community-twenty-first-century-putnam-2007-article-84876#:~:text=discussed,the%20negative%20effects%20of%20diversity)) ([www.worldsupporter.org](https://www.worldsupporter.org/en/summary/e-pluribus-unum-diversity-and-community-twenty-first-century-putnam-2007-article-84876#:~:text=It%20is%20important%20to%20realize,and%20spreading%20knowledge%20and%20technology)). This nuanced view – acknowledging negative externalities for social capital in the short term, but emphasizing integration over time – has been highly influential (and sometimes controversially received) in debates about diversity. 

6. **Additional Source – *World Economic Forum (2023) report on skilled immigration and innovation***: This analysis (by economists Mayda, Orefice, and colleagues) highlights the positive externalities of high-skilled immigration. It reports evidence that inflows of skilled foreign workers significantly boost innovation in host countries. For example, one cited study found that immigration to the U.S. from 1965–2010 led to about an **8% increase in patents per capita**, as immigrants contributed disproportionately to science and engineering breakthroughs ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/03/skilled-immigration-innovation-firms/#:~:text=Recent%20contributions%20focus%20on%20the,among%20immigrants%20than%20among%20natives)). Similarly, increases in H-1B visas (for skilled workers) were associated with higher rates of patenting and tech entrepreneurship, with no evidence of displacing native inventors ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/03/skilled-immigration-innovation-firms/#:~:text=greatly%20contributed%20to%20innovation%20and,on%20the%20number%20of%20patents)). The WEF piece also notes that skilled migrants help address labor shortages in cutting-edge industries and can offset the effects of aging populations in developed countries. This perspective underscores that the externalities of immigration can be highly beneficial when the immigrants bring scarce skills: they drive innovation, productivity, and even create jobs for others. The authors suggest that recognizing these positive spillovers could inform more proactive policies to attract talent globally.
