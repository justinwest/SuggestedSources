# What are the externalities of immigration?

An externality is a cost or benefit of an economic activity experienced by an unrelated third party. In the context of immigration, the primary parties are the immigrant and their employer (or the country as an abstract entity granting entry). The externalities are the spillover effects, both positive and negative, that impact the broader resident population, including native-born citizens and previous immigrants. These effects are complex, widely debated, and depend heavily on the skill level of immigrants, the economic conditions of the host country, and the integration policies in place.

### Positive Externalities of Immigration

1.  **Economic Growth and Innovation:** Immigrants contribute to economic growth by increasing the labor supply and consumer demand. High-skilled immigrants, in particular, are disproportionately associated with innovation. They have higher rates of patenting, publishing, and starting businesses compared to the native-born population [1]. This entrepreneurial activity creates jobs for everyone and introduces new products and services to the market, generating a positive ripple effect throughout the economy. For example, studies have shown that immigrants are responsible for a significant share of new businesses and patents in the United States, contributing to technological advancement and productivity growth [2].

2.  **Labor Market Complementarity:** Rather than simply competing for the same jobs, immigrants often have skills and educational backgrounds that complement those of the native workforce. They may fill labor shortages in both high-skill sectors (like technology and medicine) and low-skill sectors (like agriculture and hospitality) that native-born workers are less willing to enter [3]. This complementarity can make the economy more efficient, allowing native-born workers to specialize in tasks that require better language and communication skills, ultimately raising their productivity and wages [4].

3.  **Demographic Rejuvenation:** Many developed nations face aging populations and declining birth rates, which threaten the solvency of social security and pension systems. Immigration provides a key demographic boost by bringing in younger workers who contribute taxes that support public services and social safety nets for an aging population [5]. This influx of a younger, working-age population helps to stabilize the dependency ratio (the ratio of non-workers to workers), ensuring the long-term fiscal health of the nation.

4.  **Fiscal Contributions:** Over their lifetimes, immigrants—especially those who are high-skilled and arrive at a young working age—are often net fiscal contributors. They pay more in taxes (income, property, consumption) than they consume in public services like schools, healthcare, and welfare benefits [5]. While there can be initial costs, particularly for educating the children of immigrants, the long-term fiscal impact is generally found to be positive, especially at the federal level where income and payroll taxes are collected.

5.  **Cultural Enrichment and Diversity:** Immigrants introduce new foods, music, traditions, art, and perspectives that enrich the cultural landscape of the host society. This diversity can foster creativity and tolerance. Exposure to different cultures can also enhance the skill set of the native population, creating a more dynamic and globally connected society. While harder to quantify than economic impacts, these cultural benefits are a significant positive externality for many communities.

### Negative Externalities of Immigration

1.  **Wage Depression for Specific Groups:** While the overall effect on wages is debated, some of the most robust evidence for a negative externality concerns the wages of a specific subgroup: low-skilled, native-born workers who are in direct competition with low-skilled immigrants. Economist George Borjas argues that an influx of immigrants with similar skill levels increases the labor supply in that segment, which can drive down wages for the native-born workers who perform the same jobs [6]. This effect is concentrated among those without a high school diploma and does not typically apply to middle- or high-skilled native workers, whose wages may even rise due to complementarity [4].

2.  **Strain on Public Services and Infrastructure:** A rapid increase in population, regardless of its source, places greater demand on public services and infrastructure. This can lead to overcrowded schools, longer wait times for healthcare, increased traffic congestion, and a strain on social housing [7]. These costs are often concentrated at the state and local levels, which are primarily responsible for funding education and healthcare. If tax revenues from new immigrants do not keep pace with this increased demand, native-born residents may experience a decline in the quality of public services or face higher local taxes [5].

3.  **Fiscal Costs at the Local Level:** While immigrants may be net contributors at the federal level, they can represent a net fiscal cost at the state and local levels, at least in the short term. This is largely because the cost of educating the children of immigrants falls on local and state governments, while the primary taxes paid by immigrants (income and payroll taxes) flow mainly to the federal government [5]. This fiscal imbalance can create significant budgetary challenges for communities with large immigrant populations.

4.  **Social Cohesion and Integration Challenges:** In the short term, high levels of immigration can create challenges for social cohesion. Research by political scientist Robert Putnam found that in ethnically diverse communities, residents of all backgrounds may tend to "hunker down," exhibiting less trust in their neighbors, lower participation in community life, and a weaker sense of shared identity [8]. This is not an argument against diversity itself, but an observation of a short-term externality that can arise if integration processes are not managed well. Overcoming these challenges requires investment in language training, civic education, and community-building initiatives.

5.  **Environmental Impact:** Population growth from immigration contributes to an increased environmental footprint. More people lead to greater consumption of resources like water and energy, increased waste production, and a larger carbon footprint from transportation and housing. It can also fuel urban sprawl, leading to the loss of green spaces and natural habitats [9]. While this externality is a function of population growth in general, immigration is a significant driver of population change in many developed countries.

    *   **Author's View:** The authors provide evidence that high-skilled immigration, specifically through the H-1B visa program, directly boosts innovation. They show that a significant portion of patents filed in the U.S. are by inventors of foreign origin and that changes in visa policy directly impact patenting rates in technology firms.

    *   **Author's View:** Peri argues that immigrants often complement the skills of native workers rather than competing with them. This complementarity pushes native workers into higher-skilled, communication-intensive jobs, raising overall productivity. He finds little evidence of immigrants crowding out native employment.

    *   **Author's View:** Card's research suggests that the overall impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers is small. He argues that the U.S. labor market absorbs immigrants with relative ease and that immigration has only a minor effect on wage inequality, challenging the view that it is a primary driver of falling wages for the low-skilled.

It concludes that the long-term fiscal impact of immigrants is generally positive, but that state and local governments can face net costs, particularly from educating immigrants' children.

    *   **Author's View:** Borjas is a leading proponent of the view that immigration creates a negative wage externality for a specific group: low-skilled native workers. He argues that basic supply-and-demand logic dictates that when the supply of low-skilled labor increases, the wages for that group must fall, and he presents evidence to support this claim.
