Systemic failures – when an entire system or institution breaks down – offer several key lessons. First, **intelligence alone is not enough to prevent failure when coordination is lacking**. Often the biggest challenges are *coordination problems*, where multiple interdependent factors must all be addressed in tandem for a solution to work. In such cases, “one weak link can ruin it for the rest” and even very **smart, well-intentioned people cannot fix the issue by themselves** if they are working at cross-purposes or only solving part of the problem [1]. Many persistent societal problems (from environmental crises to organizational breakdowns) fall into this category – they remain unsolved not due to lack of knowledge, but because effective collective action and aligned incentives are missing [1]. A major lesson from systemic failures is that we must design systems that enable better coordination and address root causes holistically, rather than expecting lone geniuses or piecemeal efforts to succeed in a broken framework [1].

Second, **how we interpret and react to failure is critical**. There is a human tendency to look for simple, clear-cut explanations – often assigning blame to a single person or factor – but this can be misleading and counterproductive. After a large-scale failure, people may engage in *“splitting”* or scapegoating, casting one side as entirely bad and another as wholly good, which oversimplifies complex situations [2]. This psychological defense mechanism can create a false sense of resolution (“we found the bad guy”) while **preventing deeper learning**. For example, in the aftermath of the Iraq War, public discourse often fixated on blaming individual leaders or groups (e.g. **“Bush is all bad” or, from the other side, “liberals are treasonous”**) instead of grappling with the nuanced policy failures and assumptions that led to the debacle [2]. This *black-and-white* thinking provided emotional relief but fostered apathy – “the split is the solution,” so people stop seeking real solutions once a scapegoat is labeled [2]. As one commentator noted, when society’s *“entire emotional energy is diverted to the ‘all bad’ other,”* the will to actually solve the underlying problem fades [2]. In other words, **scapegoating and polarizing narratives inhibit real problem-solving**. The lesson here is to resist simplistic narratives and instead undertake honest, systemic analysis of what went wrong. By avoiding the trap of blaming everything on one factor, we can maintain accountability *without* absolving ourselves or the system at large of responsibility to change. True learning from failure requires facing complexity – acknowledging multiple contributing factors and our own biases – rather than conveniently pinning the failure on a single villain [2].

Third, **systemic failures reveal the limits of expert understanding and the dangers of groupthink or outdated models**. Entire fields or industries can go astray if their prevailing assumptions are flawed. The **“failure of economists”** in some crises illustrates this point: economists as a community have sometimes missed looming problems or unintended consequences because they relied on overly narrow models of reality [3]. For instance, some authors argue that mainstream economic thinking on issues like globalization and migration became a kind of systemic blind spot. Economists often assumed that humans are interchangeable units of input and that increasing population or trade will straightforwardly yield growth, neglecting important social complexities [3]. This technocratic optimism – the idea that *“more people = more transactions = more gains from trade”* – turned out to be **“a ludicrously simplistic way to look at the complexities of human interactions,”** as one critique put it [3]. In practice, people from different cultures and contexts do not all respond the same way to incentives, and large population shifts can strain social systems in unpredictable ways. When experts ignore such factors, the whole system can fail despite everyone following the accepted rules or models. What we learn here is the importance of intellectual humility and diversity of perspective in any complex field. No matter how smart or credentialed a group is, **if they all overlook the same critical variables or evidence, their collective failure can be colossal**. Preventing systemic failures thus requires challenging our assumptions and continually integrating insights from history, psychology, and other domains. In the economists’ case, there had been clear historical evidence (for example, Nobel-winning research on how mass migrations disrupted past societies) that was available but largely ignored – a lapse one author bluntly termed “*criminal intellectual negligence*” [3]. The broader takeaway is that **learning from failure means updating our mental models**: experts and decision-makers must be willing to question entrenched theories, seek out dissenting information, and adapt before small issues snowball into system-wide breakdowns.

In summary, systemic failures teach us that we need to think in systems. Major failures rarely stem from one bad actor or a single mistake; they arise from multiple interlocking factors – missed signals, misaligned incentives, coordination breakdowns, and cognitive biases – that combine to produce a collapse. Learning from such failures requires addressing problems at the systemic level. That means **improving coordination and incentive structures** so that well-meaning individuals can actually achieve collective results rather than getting in each other’s way [1]. It means **facing uncomfortable truths and complexity** instead of choosing convenient scapegoats or narratives that mask the real issues [2]. And it means **cultivating a culture of reflection and openness to change**, especially among experts and leaders, so that warnings are heeded and models updated in time to avert future disasters [3]. By understanding these lessons, we can reform our systems to be more resilient and avoid repeating the same failures. Each systemic failure, from wars to economic crashes, is an opportunity to identify the deeper causes and make sure that “the right lessons” – not the wrong, simplistic ones – are learned [2]. Ultimately, what we learn is that success in complex human systems demands more than individual intelligence or good intent; it demands **collective wisdom, continual self-correction, and the courage to overhaul the structures that aren’t working**. Only by internalizing these lessons can we hope to prevent the next systemic failure or respond to it more effectively when it comes. [1][2][3]

It argues that society coped by **“splitting”** and **scapegoating** – painting one side as all-good or all-bad (e.g. blaming all problems on a particular leader) – which created a false sense of resolution and **widespread apathy**. The author concludes that this narcissistic, black-and-white thinking prevented people from learning the right lessons (focusing on real solutions) and warns that such defense mechanisms can push a society toward unhealthy dynamics (even comparing the outcome to a form of *modern feudalism* driven by tribalism). *In short, the wrong takeaway from a failure can compound the problem.* **(URL:** _https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2007/05/the_wrong_lessons_of_iraq.html_ **)**

They argue that many economists pushed “open-border” models and assumptions that treated people as interchangeable inputs, which is **overly simplistic and neglects real-world social complexities**. Citing historical research (e.g. Robert Fogel’s work on how 19th-century mass migration contributed to societal fractures), they label this oversight “*criminal intellectual negligence*.” The authors’ view is that economists, as a system, ignored crucial evidence and cultural factors, illustrating how even experts can collectively err when blinded by groupthink or ideology. *This case underlines the importance of updating expert models and paying attention to historical and social realities to learn from past failures.* **(URL:** _https://www.notonyourteam.co.uk/p/the-failure-of-economists_ **)**
