Genetic engineering of humans, which encompasses techniques like CRISPR gene editing, embryo selection via preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), and potential germline modifications, raises profound ethical, scientific, and societal questions. This response examines whether such practices should be allowed, drawing on arguments from provided sources and additional reputable references for a balanced analysis. Proponents argue for benefits in health, intelligence, and human flourishing, while opponents highlight risks of inequality, unintended consequences, and ethical violations. Ultimately, I argue that genetic engineering should be allowed under strict regulations, prioritizing therapeutic applications over enhancements, to maximize benefits while mitigating harms.

### Arguments in Favor of Allowing Genetic Engineering
Advocates emphasize the potential to eradicate genetic diseases, enhance traits, and advance human capabilities. For instance, embryo selection for polygenic traits (e.g., intelligence or disease resistance) is already feasible through companies like Genomic Prediction and Orchid, which screen IVF embryos based on genetic scores [4]. This could reduce the incidence of conditions like cystic fibrosis or Huntington's disease, improving quality of life and reducing healthcare burdens [1]. George Church, a prominent geneticist, supports advancing genetic technologies with protections, arguing that tools like secure genetic databases can enable safe editing while preserving privacy [1]. He envisions a future where genetic engineering democratizes health improvements, provided safeguards against misuse are in place.

From a eugenics-informed perspective, some argue that genetic enhancement could address societal challenges like declining fertility rates or cognitive demands in a complex world. A geneticist's view posits that selective breeding and editing are natural extensions of human evolution, potentially boosting traits like IQ to foster innovation and prosperity [2]. This aligns with "high alchemy" concepts, which frame genetic engineering as a tool for human augmentation, blending biotechnology with philosophy to create "better" humans [3]. Proponents like Scott Alexander note that trait-based embryo selection is not full-fledged eugenics but a incremental step, already legal in many places for medical reasons, and could be expanded ethically if data improves [4].

Additional evidence from the National Human Genome Research Institute supports this, highlighting successful gene therapies (e.g., for sickle cell disease via CRISPR) that have been approved by the FDA, demonstrating real-world benefits without widespread harm [5]. Allowing such engineering could accelerate medical progress, with estimates suggesting it might increase average IQ by 5-15 points per generation through selection alone, benefiting society [4].

### Arguments Against Allowing Genetic Engineering
Critics warn of ethical pitfalls, including the slippery slope to designer babies, exacerbation of social inequalities, and unknown long-term risks. For example, germline editing (changes passed to offspring) could introduce off-target mutations, leading to unforeseen health issues [6]. The Harvard source underscores the need for protection against genetic discrimination, implying that without robust regulations, engineering could lead to privacy breaches or coercive applications [1].

A boomer geneticist's critique highlights historical eugenics abuses, cautioning that modern genetic engineering might repeat past mistakes by prioritizing certain traits, potentially leading to a stratified society where only the wealthy access enhancements [2]. This echoes concerns in bioethics literature, such as the Nuffield Council on Bioethics report, which argues that heritable genome editing could widen inequality and undermine human dignity by commodifying children [6]. Furthermore, philosophical objections in the "high alchemy" discussion question whether engineering humans erodes natural diversity or free will [3].

Scott Alexander acknowledges downsides, such as the low predictive power of current polygenic scores (e.g., only 7-10% variance explained for intelligence), which could lead to overhyped expectations and ethical overreach [4]. Public opinion, as per a 2023 Pew Research survey, shows widespread unease: only 27% of Americans support gene editing for non-medical enhancements [7]. Opponents also cite the "playing God" argument, fearing that altering the human genome could disrupt ecosystems or evolutionary balance.

### Ethical, Scientific, and Societal Considerations
Ethically, frameworks like those from the World Health Organization recommend allowing genetic engineering only for severe diseases, with bans on enhancements until global consensus is reached [8]. Scientifically, while CRISPR has revolutionized editing (e.g., the 2020 Nobel Prize-winning work), challenges like mosaicism (uneven editing in cells) persist [5]. Societally, allowing it could foster a divide between "genetically enhanced" and "natural" individuals, but regulations could mitigate this through subsidies or public funding.

A balanced approach might involve tiered permissions: therapeutic editing (e.g., fixing single-gene disorders) should be allowed immediately, embryo selection for polygenic risks permitted with oversight, and enhancements (e.g., boosting height or intelligence) restricted pending further research and ethical debate [4][6].

### Conclusion
Genetic engineering of humans should be allowed, but with stringent regulations to ensure it serves therapeutic goals, protects vulnerable populations, and prevents abuse. The potential to alleviate suffering outweighs risks if managed responsibly, as evidenced by ongoing safe applications [1][5]. However, blanket prohibition would stifle innovation, while unchecked allowance risks dystopian outcomes. International guidelines, informed consent, and equitable access are essential. Policymakers should draw from sources like these to craft frameworks that evolve with technology.
