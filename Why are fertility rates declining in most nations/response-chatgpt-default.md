# Why are fertility rates declining in most nations?

Why fertility is falling almost everywhere:

1. The demographic-transition “engine”
   • As nations move from agrarian, high-mortality conditions to urban, high-income ones, death rates fall first, then birth rates follow.  Once parents can be confident children will survive, they no longer need 4-6 births to insure two adults reach adulthood.

2. Education, especially of girls
   • Each additional year of female schooling lowers completed family size by roughly 0.1-0.3 children.  
   • Schooling raises opportunity costs of early marriage, boosts wage prospects, increases knowledge of contraception, and alters aspirations.

3. Effective, widely available contraception
   • Modern methods (pill, IUD, implant, sterilisation) became cheap and ubiquitous after the 1960s.  Couples can now separate sex from child-bearing with <1 % annual failure rates.

4. Women’s labour-force participation
   • Dual-earner, career-oriented households dominate in middle- and high-income economies.  
   • Children compete with paid work for time; forgone earnings make large families costly.

5. Later marriage and partnership instability
   • Median age at first marriage is now 30+ in much of Europe/East Asia versus <23 in 1970.  Fewer reproductive years remain, and union break-ups interrupt child-bearing.

6. Urbanisation and the monetary cost of children
   • In cities, children cease to be economic “assets” (farm help, old-age security) and become “cost centres”—housing, schooling, childcare and lost parental earnings.  
   • Direct costs (food, clothing, fees) plus indirect costs (care time) now exceed US$200 000 per child in many OECD economies.

7. Changing values and gender norms
   • Post-materialist attitudes emphasise self-realisation, consumption, travel and leisure.  
   • Survey data (World Values Survey, Generations & Gender Survey) show rising acceptance of child-free lifestyles and smaller “ideal” family size.

8. Economic uncertainty and housing constraints
   • Precarious employment, high youth unemployment and unaffordable housing push births later or reduce desired numbers.  
   • Fertility dips track recessions: 1997 Asian crisis, 2008-09 Great Recession, Covid-19 in 2020.

9. Policy signals
   • Pension systems, universal schooling and public health insurance reduce the need for “old-age security” children.  
   • Many countries still lack supportive family policies (paid leave, childcare, flexible work).  Couples then “stop at one or none.”

10. Climate and ethical concerns
   • Growing minorities cite climate anxiety, population ethics or a wish to minimise ecological footprint as reasons to delay or avoid parenthood.

11. Rising infertility and health factors
   • Advanced parental age, obesity, STIs, endocrine disruptors and postponement contribute to higher rates of sub-fecundity; IVF can only partly offset this.

12. Migration diffusion
   • Migrants carry lower-fertility norms back to origin countries through media, remittances and return visits, accelerating the global spread of small-family ideals.

Putting it together

Fertility decline is a multi-causal outcome of modernisation.  Once child survival is assured, education rises, and women gain economic roles, couples consciously limit births via cheap contraception.  Urban living, high child costs, shifting values and economic uncertainties then lock low fertility in place.  Unless policies substantially lower the work-family trade-off or societies revalue larger families, most nations will remain below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman.
