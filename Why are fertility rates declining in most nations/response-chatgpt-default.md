Short answer: Fertility falls when child survival improves, girls’ schooling expands, contraception becomes widely available, and economies urbanize. In high‑income settings, additional forces—later partnering, high housing/childcare costs, long work hours, persistent gender inequities at home and at work, and prolonged economic uncertainty—push births later and lower than intended. Period fertility rates are further depressed by a timing (tempo) effect as people delay parenthood. Together, these structural, economic, and cultural shifts explain why most countries today have below‑replacement fertility. [1][4][5][6][7][9][10][11][12][13][14]

What’s driving the decline

- Demographic transition fundamentals
  - Falling infant/child mortality reduces the need for “extra” births to achieve a desired number of surviving children. As countries urbanize and move out of agriculture, and as education expands, desired family size declines. Wider access to modern contraception enables couples to realize smaller desired families. [1][2]
  - These classic forces explain much of the ongoing decline across low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs). [1][2]

- Women’s education, work, and bargaining power
  - More years of schooling and rising female labor-force participation raise the opportunity cost of early and multiple births, encourage later marriage/childbearing, and increase the ability to control fertility. [1][2]
  - In high‑income countries, a mismatch between high gender equality in education/work and lower equity in the family and institutions can suppress fertility; where equity advances in both spheres, fertility tends to be higher (though still below replacement). [3][4]

- Economic costs, time pressures, and intensive parenting
  - The direct and indirect costs of children have risen, especially in cities: housing, childcare, and the time cost of parenting in “high-investment” child-rearing cultures. These pressures push births later and reduce parity progression. [7][8][9][17]
  - High housing costs in particular are linked to lower fertility among younger renters and late starters. [8][9]

- Postponement (tempo) of childbearing
  - The mean age at first birth has risen in nearly all high‑income countries. Postponement mechanically lowers the period total fertility rate (TFR) even if lifetime (cohort) births changed little. Although some delayed births are “recuperated” at older ages, recuperation has been incomplete in many places. [5][10]
  - This postponement dynamic helps explain sustained low period TFRs in Europe and East Asia. [5][10]

- Macroeconomic uncertainty and labor-market instability
  - Fertility is pro‑cyclical: recessions and insecure employment lead people to delay or forgo births. The Great Recession and subsequent slow recoveries had lasting effects on completed fertility for some cohorts, especially in Southern and Eastern Europe and among younger adults in the United States. [6][7]
  - Persistent uncertainty (e.g., gig/temporary work, volatile housing) keeps intended births from materializing. [6][7]

- Cultural and value change
  - The “second demographic transition” emphasizes individual autonomy, secularization, and new family forms. In many countries, later and less marriage/cohabitation, more time spent single, and a decoupling of marriage from childbearing (or—East Asia—continued tight coupling of childbearing to marriage amid declining marriage) have reduced period fertility. [11][12]

- Marriage market and partnership dynamics
  - In East Asia especially, highly education- and work-intensive environments, long hours, and persistent norms linking childbearing to marriage coincide with delayed/declining marriage, lowering fertility to “ultra‑low” levels. [12]
  - Where men’s employment prospects stagnate, “marriage squeezes” and unstable unions can also depress births. [6][12]

- Policies and institutions
  - Family policies that reduce the cost of children—paid leaves that support both parents, affordable childcare, flexible/shorter hours—are associated with relatively higher fertility in a cross‑national sense, though effects are typically moderate and insufficient to restore replacement-level fertility on their own. [9][13]
  - In settings with long hours, weak care infrastructure, and strong career penalties for mothers, fertility tends to be especially low. [9][12][13]

Regional patterns and nuances

- High‑income countries (OECD, East Asia): Below‑replacement fertility is widespread. The combination of postponement, high costs, long work hours, and gender‑equity mismatches explains very low TFRs in East Asia and Southern Europe; Nordic/Western Europe maintain relatively higher (but still sub‑replacement) fertility where gender-egalitarian norms and family policies are stronger—yet even there, fertility has dipped in the 2010s–2020s. [5][9][10][12][13]

- Low‑ and middle‑income countries: Fertility is declining almost everywhere, driven by rising child survival, education (especially for girls), urbanization, and family planning. Sub‑Saharan Africa remains higher but is steadily falling; desired family sizes are still larger and the transition has been later/slower than in other regions. [1][2][14]

Common misconceptions

- “It’s mainly biology/infertility.” Biological limits matter more as childbearing shifts to older ages, but the bulk of the decline reflects changes in desired family size, partnership timing, and constraints. Assisted reproduction contributes a small share of births (roughly a few percent in many rich countries) and cannot offset late childbearing at the population level. Evidence of declining sperm counts exists but is debated and does not explain cross‑national fertility patterns. [7][15][16]

- “Policy can quickly restore replacement fertility.” Family policy can mitigate declines and support intentions, but no single policy has reliably lifted fertility back to 2.1 on a sustained basis; institutions, labor markets, norms, and housing conditions matter jointly and change slowly. [9][13]

Bottom line

- Most nations’ fertility rates are falling because development lowered desired family size and enabled contraception, while in richer countries, later partnering, higher costs and uncertainty, time-intensive parenting, and gender‑institutional mismatches have further reduced and delayed births. Period measures look especially low due to postponement, and while supportive policies help, they rarely reverse these broad structural forces. [1][2][5][6][7][9][11][12][13]
