# Why are fertility rates declining in most nations?

Fertility rates have been falling almost everywhere for four broad, mutually reinforcing reasons— economics, gender-role change, urbanization/technology, and shifting values.  None of the factors acts alone; together they have pushed most countries below the “replacement” level of 2.1 births per woman.

1. Rising costs and economic uncertainty  
   • Children have become more expensive while the economic payoff from having many of them has disappeared.  In OECD countries the direct cost of raising a child to age 18 now rivals the price of a house; in many emerging economies schooling is no longer free and informal‐sector jobs that once relied on large families are vanishing [6], [8].  
   • Housing, child-care and education costs rise fastest in the big cities where jobs are concentrated, so would-be parents postpone or forgo child-bearing even when incomes are higher [5].  
   • Greater income volatility and weak social-security nets make young adults unwilling to assume the long-term obligation of parenting [7].

2. Later marriage, female education and employment  
   • Women everywhere spend more years in school and enter the labour force in larger numbers.  Each additional year of female schooling reduces completed fertility by roughly 0.3 births, according to cross-country estimates in The Lancet forecasting study [3].  
   • Career opportunities raise the “opportunity cost” of time spent on unpaid care work.  When households and societies do not redistribute that care work, couples choose fewer children or none at all [6].  
   • Because education also leads to later marriage and later first births, the biological window for having two or three children narrows, especially where assisted reproduction is costly or stigmatised [3].

3. Urbanisation, technology and easier control of reproduction  
   • More than half of humanity now lives in cities where children are economic consumers rather than producers.  Farm families once needed extra hands; urban families pay extra rent for an additional bedroom.  
   • Modern contraception and legal access to abortion give individuals far more control over how many children they have and when they have them.  The availability of reliable birth control typically cuts fertility by one birth per woman within a decade of introduction [8].  
   • Infant and child mortality have collapsed, so parents no longer “over-insure” by having large families [3].

4. Changing norms, aspirations and relationship patterns  
   • Surveys in Europe, East Asia and North America show that self-development, travel, leisure and mental health have become higher-priority life goals than parenthood for many under-40s [4], [1].  
   • “Individualisation” also shows up in delayed partnering, higher divorce rates and more people remaining single—all associated with lower fertility [6].  
   • Perceptions of political, environmental or social decline (e.g., climate anxiety) discourage some would-be parents, though the effect is hard to quantify.

Additional but smaller contributors  
   • Biological sub-fertility linked to later child-bearing and lifestyle factors (obesity, pollution) is rising, but explains only a fraction of the overall decline [1].  
   • Policy can moderate the fall—Nordic cash benefits and subsidised child-care raise births by 0.1–0.3—but so far no rich country has fully reversed the down-trend [5].

Because all these drivers accompany modernisation, The Lancet projects that by 2050 151 of 195 countries will have fertility below replacement; by 2100, 183 will, unless migration or large pronatalist incentives intervene [3].  In short, fertility is falling because the economic, social and cultural logic that once favoured large families has flipped, and most societies have not yet adjusted institutions and expectations to make child-rearing compatible with contemporary adult lives.
