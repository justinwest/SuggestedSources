Short answer: As countries get richer, safer, and more urban, people marry and have children later; women’s education and employment rise; effective contraception gives more control; and the direct and opportunity costs of raising children increase. These forces lower desired family size and postpone births, and in many places institutions haven’t adapted to dual-earner families, further suppressing childbearing. Biological constraints from later childbearing and possible environmental factors add to the decline, but most of the trend is driven by social and economic change, not genetics or a single cultural fad [1][2][3][4][5][8].

What’s happening
- The trend: The global total fertility rate (TFR) fell from roughly 5 births per woman in 1960 to about 2.3 today, with a majority of countries now below the “replacement” level of around 2.1. Projections suggest most nations will remain below replacement through 2100 absent major changes [1][2][4].

Why fertility rates are falling

1) Socioeconomic development changes the calculus of family size
- Female education and employment: As girls’ schooling and women’s labor-force participation rise, the opportunity cost of time spent on childrearing increases and desired family size falls. This is one of the most robust drivers identified globally [2][3].
- Quality–quantity trade-off: With higher incomes and returns to skills, parents invest more per child (education, housing, enrichment), which makes large families less attractive [3][9].
- Urbanization: In cities, children are less economically “productive,” space is limited, and housing is expensive, all of which push down fertility [3][4].

2) Later partnering and delayed childbearing
- Marriage and first births are occurring later, which depresses the period TFR (“tempo effect”). Some delayed births are never fully “caught up,” reducing completed family size (“quantum effect”), especially when high career penalties and costly childcare make second and third births less likely [3][9][6].
- Partnering has become harder for many (smaller dating/marriage markets, more time in education, instability), contributing to later or foregone childbearing [6].

3) Contraception and reproductive autonomy
- Widespread access to effective contraception enables people to realize lower desired family sizes and to avoid unplanned births. Increased “met need” for family planning and female education explain much of the historical decline and projected future low fertility across countries [2].

4) Costs, uncertainty, and policy environments
- High and rising costs of housing, childcare, and education, combined with insecure employment and slow wage growth for the young, deter childbearing or compress it to one child for many households [3][4][6].
- Gender-equity mismatch: In many countries, women advanced rapidly in education and work, but households, workplaces, and policies did not adapt (limited childcare, inflexible jobs, short leaves, tax penalties for second earners). This “dual burden” is linked to lower fertility, whereas places that make dual-earner/dual-carer models easier tend to have somewhat higher (though still sub-replacement) fertility [3].

5) Health and biological factors
- Delayed childbearing raises age-related infertility risks; conditions like obesity, some STIs, and possibly environmental exposures (e.g., endocrine-disrupting chemicals) may contribute to impaired fecundity. The evidence is mixed and the aggregate contribution is uncertain, but these mechanisms likely play a supportive, not dominant, role compared to socioeconomic drivers [5].

6) Cultural change
- Greater individualism, secularization, and changing expectations around marriage and parenthood have reduced desired family size for some. Commentators also point to therapy/estrangement norms and social pessimism; these are debated and less well-quantified compared to the economic and demographic drivers above [6][7][8].

Common misconceptions
- It’s not mainly about genetics or a sudden cultural fad. The long-run fall in fertility tracks structural changes—education, urbanization, mortality declines, contraception, and women’s economic opportunities—observed across regions and income levels. Commentaries that blame genetics or a single recent phenomenon miss the breadth of evidence [2][3][8].
- Pronatalist policies can help at the margin but rarely restore replacement fertility on their own. Evidence favors comprehensive packages that reduce the time and money costs of children and support gender-equal caregiving and flexible work; even then, most advanced economies remain below replacement [3][4].

Bottom line
Fertility is falling in most nations because modern development changes both the desire and feasibility of having (many) children: people start families later, invest more per child, face higher and more uncertain costs, and have the tools to avoid unintended births. Institutional lag and affordability constraints amplify these choices, while biological factors from later childbearing add a smaller, compounding effect [1][2][3][4][5].
