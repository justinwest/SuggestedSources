# Why are fertility rates declining in most nations?

Fertility is falling almost everywhere, but the reasons are not mysterious.  Demographers, economists and even would-be “pronatalists” tend to name the same handful of forces, all of which are now present in most countries.   

1. Women’s schooling, jobs and control over reproduction  
   • The strongest single predictor of low fertility is the length of time girls stay in school and the breadth of professional options open to them.  A massive modelling study in The Lancet concludes that “increasing female educational attainment and access to modern contraception” explain most of the post-1960 decline and will push almost every nation below replacement level by mid-century [3].  
   • Education delays marriage, raises the opportunity cost of leaving the labour force, and makes unplanned births less common.

2. Reliable contraception and lower child mortality  
   • Modern contraceptives mean couples can realise a conscious choice for smaller families, while improvements in child survival remove the old need to “over-birth” as insurance [3].

3. Urbanisation and the high cost of children  
   • Children, once an economic asset on farms, are an economic expense in cities.  The Hill notes that housing, childcare and education bills, especially in urban cores, “squeeze family formation,” making desired family size fall even for people who say they want more children [1].

4. Economic insecurity and delayed adulthood  
   • Younger adults face precarious work, student debt and unaffordable housing.  A New York Times essay reports that many millennials delay or forgo parenthood because they doubt they can offer children financial stability or the mental bandwidth required to raise them well [4].

5. Changing cultural values and personal preferences  
   • Surveys show rising priority on self-development, travel and leisure over early parenting; some would-be parents also cite climate anxiety or strained relations with their own parents as reasons to remain child-free [4].

6. Later child-bearing and possible biological headwinds  
   • When first births are postponed into the 30s, fewer total births fit into the remaining reproductive window.  The Hill piece also flags worries about declining sperm counts and other biological factors that can lower fecundity as couples age, compounding the social drivers of low fertility [1].

The net result is visible in the data: the global total fertility rate has fallen from about 5.0 births per woman in 1960 to roughly 2.3 in 2021, with most high- and middle-income countries now well below the replacement threshold of 2.1 [2].

In short, fertility is descending because education, autonomy and urban prosperity have changed the cost–benefit calculation of having children; reliable contraception lets people act on those preferences; and today’s economic and cultural environment often nudges them toward smaller families or none at all.
