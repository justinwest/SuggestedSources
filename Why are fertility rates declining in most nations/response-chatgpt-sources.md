# Why are fertility rates declining in most nations?

Most countries now have total-fertility rates (TFRs) at, or below, the 2.1 births-per-woman replacement level.  Worldwide TFR has fallen from about 5.0 in 1960 to 2.3 in 2022, and the World Bank shows declines on every continent except parts of sub-Saharan Africa [2].  Demographers point to a bundle of intertwined forces—economic, social, technological, biological and policy-driven—that together push fertility downward.  No single factor is decisive everywhere, but the following mechanisms recur across nations.

1. Female education and labour-market opportunity  
   • Each additional year of girls’ schooling is associated with later marriage, later first birth and fewer children.  As women’s wages rise, the “opportunity cost” of time spent out of the labour force to raise children rises as well, lowering desired family size [3][6].  
   • Countries that rapidly expanded secondary and tertiary education for women (South Korea, Spain, Brazil) saw the steepest fertility declines within a single generation.

2. Urbanisation and the economics of child-rearing  
   • In rural, agrarian settings children can be economic assets; in dense cities they are mainly consumers.  Housing is more expensive and living space scarcer; schooling is longer and costlier.  McKinsey estimates that in high-income cities the direct cost of raising a child to age 18 exceeds 20 % of lifetime household income, twice the rural share [5].  
   • Urban life also weakens extended-family support networks that traditionally shared child-care.

3. Contraceptive technology and reproductive autonomy  
   • Modern contraception, legal abortion and smaller desired family size reinforce each other.  The Lancet’s 195-country forecast attributes roughly half of the global fertility drop since 1970 to wider access to modern contraceptives and family-planning programmes [3].  

4. Postponement of partnership and childbearing  
   • Age at first marriage and first birth has risen by 4–6 years in most OECD countries since 1990.  Late partnership compresses the window in which couples can have multiple children and raises biological sub-fertility risk after age 35 [8].  Rising rates of singleness, co-habitation and relationship instability directly lower birth numbers.

5. Rising economic insecurity for young adults  
   • While higher income per capita tends to reduce fertility over the long run, precarious labour markets, short-term contracts and student debt deter childbearing among the young.  In Southern Europe and parts of East Asia, surveys show a gap of one child between the number young adults say they want and the number they expect to have, largely for economic reasons [6][7].

6. Changing values and gender norms  
   • Individualism, the pursuit of self-realisation and what the New York Times calls “therapy culture” lead some adults to view parenthood as optional, even burdensome, rather than a life milestone [4].  
   • Greater gender-equity within couple relationships can raise fertility, but where women gain labour-market rights faster than domestic burdens are shared, fertility often falls because women “double shift” at work and at home.

7. Biological and environmental headwinds  
   • Couples are increasingly attempting pregnancy at older ages, when natural fecundity declines.  Studies also implicate obesity, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, declining sperm counts and stress as possible contributors to rising involuntary childlessness [8].

8. Policy design—family-friendly or unfriendly  
   • High-quality publicly funded childcare, flexible working hours and paid parental leave mitigate low fertility in France, Sweden and, recently, Germany.  Where such supports are weak (United States, South Korea) fertility is lower than economic development alone would predict [5][6].  

9. Migration  
   • Low-fertility countries historically imported working-age migrants whose higher TFRs cushioned declines, but fertility is converging among immigrant populations as well, removing this buffer.

Outlook  
The Lancet projects that by 2050 more than three-quarters of countries will record below-replacement fertility and by 2100 only a handful of sub-Saharan nations will remain above it [3].  Unless technology dramatically extends reproductive age or policy significantly reduces the opportunity costs of parenthood, the structural drivers listed above are expected to keep fertility rates low or falling in most of the world.
