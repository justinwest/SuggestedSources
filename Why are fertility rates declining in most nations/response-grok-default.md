Fertility rates, typically measured as the total fertility rate (TFR)—the average number of children a woman is expected to have over her lifetime—have been declining in most nations worldwide. According to the United Nations, the global TFR dropped from 4.5 children per woman in the early 1970s to about 2.3 in 2021, with declines observed across developed and developing countries alike [1]. This trend is part of the broader demographic transition, where societies shift from high birth and death rates to lower ones as they industrialize and modernize. While the decline is not uniform (some sub-Saharan African countries still have higher rates), it is widespread and driven by a combination of economic, social, cultural, and policy-related factors. Below, I outline the primary reasons, supported by evidence from various sources.

### 1. Economic Factors and Cost of Living
Raising children has become increasingly expensive in many societies, particularly in urban areas where housing, education, and childcare costs are high. In developed nations like those in Europe and East Asia, the financial burden of child-rearing often deters couples from having more children or any at all [2]. For instance, in the United States, the cost of raising a child to age 18 is estimated at over $230,000, excluding college expenses, which contributes to delayed parenthood or smaller families [3]. In developing countries, economic pressures such as job insecurity and inflation also play a role, as families prioritize financial stability over larger households.

Additionally, the opportunity cost for women—foregoing career advancement or income due to childcare responsibilities—has risen as more women enter the workforce. Studies show that higher female labor force participation correlates strongly with lower fertility rates [4].

### 2. Increased Education and Empowerment of Women
Higher levels of education, especially for women, are strongly linked to declining fertility. Educated women tend to marry later, pursue careers, and have greater access to family planning, leading to fewer children [1]. For example, in countries like India and Brazil, where female literacy and enrollment in higher education have surged, fertility rates have fallen from over 5 in the 1970s to around 2 today [5]. This is often explained by the "quantity-quality tradeoff," where parents invest more resources in fewer children to ensure better outcomes, such as higher education and health [4].

### 3. Access to Contraception and Family Planning
Improved availability of contraceptives, abortion services, and reproductive health education has enabled individuals to control family size more effectively. Programs promoted by organizations like the World Health Organization have reduced unintended pregnancies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries [1]. In sub-Saharan Africa, where fertility remains relatively high, expansions in contraceptive access have begun to accelerate declines [5]. However, cultural and religious barriers in some regions can slow this effect.

### 4. Urbanization and Lifestyle Changes
As populations shift from rural to urban areas, living conditions change in ways that discourage large families. Urban environments often feature smaller living spaces, higher costs, and demanding work schedules, making it harder to accommodate multiple children [2]. Globally, urbanization rates have risen from 39% in 1980 to 56% in 2020, correlating with fertility declines [1]. Lifestyle factors, such as increased stress, later marriages (with average age at first marriage now over 30 in many OECD countries), and a focus on individualism and personal fulfillment, further contribute [3].

### 5. Government Policies and Social Programs
Policies can either accelerate or mitigate fertility declines. China's former one-child policy (1979–2015) drastically reduced its TFR to about 1.2, though it has since relaxed the policy amid concerns of an aging population [2]. In contrast, some European countries offer incentives like paid parental leave and childcare subsidies to boost births, but these have had limited success in reversing trends [4]. In many nations, the lack of supportive policies (e.g., affordable childcare) exacerbates the decline.

### 6. Health, Environmental, and Cultural Shifts
Broader factors include improved child survival rates, which reduce the need for large families as "insurance" against infant mortality [1]. Environmental concerns, such as climate change and pollution, may also influence decisions, with some younger people citing overpopulation or ecological footprints as reasons to have fewer children [6]. Cultural shifts toward secularism, gender equality, and delayed life milestones (e.g., homeownership) in high-income countries further depress rates [3]. In some cases, declining sperm quality and rising infertility due to lifestyle factors like obesity and pollution have been noted, though these are secondary contributors [6].

### Implications and Variations
While these factors are interconnected, their impact varies by region. In high-income countries, fertility is often below the replacement level of 2.1 (e.g., 1.3 in South Korea and Italy), leading to aging populations and potential economic strains [2]. In contrast, declines in middle-income countries like those in Latin America are more tied to rapid development [5]. If trends continue, the global population could peak by mid-century and then decline, posing challenges for labor markets and social security systems [1].

This decline is not inherently negative; it can lead to better resource allocation and women's empowerment. However, addressing it may require policies promoting work-life balance, affordable housing, and immigration to offset demographic shifts.
