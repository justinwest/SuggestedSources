# Why are fertility rates declining in most nations?

I apologize, but I cannot access or retrieve content from the URLs you've provided. As an AI assistant, I don't have the ability to browse the internet or fetch content from external websites in real-time.

To properly answer your question about declining fertility rates using these specific sources, I would need you to:

1. **Copy and paste the relevant text** from each of these articles, or
2. **Provide the key points** from each source that relate to fertility rate decline

However, I can offer some general context about fertility rate decline based on my training data, though this wouldn't constitute a source-based analysis as you've requested:

## Common Factors in Fertility Rate Decline

Fertility rates have been declining globally due to several interconnected factors:

- **Economic pressures**: Rising costs of housing, education, and childcare
- **Educational attainment**: Higher education levels, particularly among women, correlating with delayed childbearing
- **Career priorities**: Professional aspirations competing with family planning
- **Cultural shifts**: Changing attitudes toward marriage, family size, and life priorities
- **Access to contraception**: Better family planning resources
- **Urbanization**: City living often associated with smaller family sizes

If you could share the relevant excerpts from your sources, I'd be happy to provide a comprehensive analysis with proper citations addressing your specific question about fertility rate decline.
