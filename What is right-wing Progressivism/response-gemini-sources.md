Right-wing Progressivism is a developing political ideology that merges right-leaning goals like nationalism and social traditionalism with methods historically associated with the early 20th-century Progressive movement, such as the strategic use of state power to drive industrial policy and technological advancement [1].

This ideology is defined by several core principles:

**1. Rejection of the Ruling "Regime"**
A central theme is a profound opposition to the current governing establishment, which N.S. Lyons in *The Upheaval* calls the "managerial elite" or "the Regime" [1]. This includes not only liberal institutions but also the traditional, laissez-faire conservative establishment, both of which are seen as incompetent, corrupt, and responsible for national stagnation and decay. This worldview posits that modern problems like "wokeism" are not the root cause of decline but rather symptoms of a decadent elite class [1].

**2. Embracing State Power for National Goals**
Unlike the libertarian wing of the right, which advocates for a minimal state, right-wing Progressives believe in using the power of the state to achieve national objectives [1]. This includes:
*   **Industrial Policy:** Actively supporting and funding key domestic industries (e.g., manufacturing, technology, energy) to strengthen the nation and secure supply chains against geopolitical rivals like China.
*   **"Trust-Busting":** Using state power to break up or regulate corporations, particularly in Big Tech, that are seen as wielding too much power or promoting an ideology contrary to the national interest [1].

**3. Nationalism and National Greatness**
The primary goal of this state intervention is not universalist but nationalist. The focus is on strengthening the nation-state—its economy, its culture, and its people. This ideology is fundamentally a project to restore a sense of "national greatness" and purpose, viewing the nation as the primary unit of political and social organization [1].

**4. Techno-Optimism and Dynamism**
Right-wing Progressivism is deeply future-oriented and champions aggressive technological progress as the engine of national power and prosperity [1]. Marc Andreessen's "Techno-Optimist Manifesto," while not explicitly political, captures this spirit. He argues against stagnation, pessimism, and concepts like the "precautionary principle," instead calling for ambition, energy, and a relentless drive to build and innovate [2]. For right-wing Progressives, technology is a key tool for achieving national renewal and outcompeting adversaries [1].

**Historical Parallels**
The ideology's name is a direct reference to the American Progressive Era (c. 1890–1920). Historical figures like Theodore Roosevelt sought to use the federal government to curb the power of Gilded Age monopolies and regulate the economy in the national interest [1, 3]. Similarly, today's right-wing Progressives aim to use state power to counter the perceived excesses of globalization and the cultural influence of powerful corporations, channeling economic and technological forces toward nationalist ends [1]. Key figures associated with this emerging movement include investor Peter Thiel and politicians like Senator J.D. Vance [1].

    *   Lyons defines right-wing Progressivism as a new political ideology that combines right-wing goals, such as nationalism, with the historical Progressive Era's belief in using active state power to achieve national greatness and technological dynamism. He argues it is a reaction against a perceived stagnant and incompetent "managerial elite" and seeks to replace libertarian-style conservatism with a more muscular, state-led approach to national challenges.

    *   Andreessen does not use the term "right-wing Progressive," but his manifesto embodies its techno-futurist element. He advocates for aggressive technological advancement, ambition, and growth as the primary drivers of human flourishing. He rejects what he sees as forces of stagnation, such as the "precautionary principle" and "sustainability," arguing instead for a dynamic, pro-technology civilization.
