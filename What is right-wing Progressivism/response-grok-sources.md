Right-wing progressivism is an emerging ideological framework that combines elements of traditional progressive optimism about human advancement, technology, and societal improvement with right-wing or conservative principles such as free markets, nationalism, individualism, and skepticism toward left-wing cultural orthodoxies like "woke" ideology or excessive government intervention. Unlike left-wing progressivism, which often emphasizes equity, social justice, and state-driven redistribution, right-wing progressivism focuses on unleashing human potential through innovation, economic growth, and technological acceleration, while rejecting what its proponents see as stifling pessimism or regulatory overreach from the left [1]. This concept has gained traction in recent years among tech entrepreneurs, intellectuals, and political figures who advocate for a "progress" agenda that aligns with right-leaning values, often positioning it as a counter to perceived cultural and economic stagnation.

### Key Characteristics
1. **Techno-Optimism and Growth-Oriented Policies**: Right-wing progressives champion rapid technological advancement and economic expansion as pathways to human flourishing. They argue that markets, entrepreneurship, and innovation—rather than government mandates—are the best mechanisms for progress. For instance, they support deregulating industries like energy, housing, and biotechnology to foster abundance and solve problems like poverty and environmental challenges through "effective accelerationism" (a term for accelerating tech development) [2][3]. This contrasts with left-wing views that might prioritize caution, equity, or degrowth to address issues like climate change.

2. **Cultural and Nationalist Elements**: While embracing progress, this ideology often incorporates right-wing critiques of modern liberalism. Proponents may oppose identity politics, cancel culture, or what they view as elitist disdain for traditional values, instead promoting a form of nationalism that sees technological and economic dominance as essential for national security and cultural vitality. Historical parallels include figures like Theodore Roosevelt, who blended progressive reforms (e.g., trust-busting and conservation) with imperialist and nationalist conservatism [4]. In contemporary terms, it's associated with "Silicon Valley right" thinkers who blend libertarianism with cultural conservatism.

3. **Rejection of Pessimism and Stagnation**: A core tenet is a belief in human agency and optimism, drawing from Enlightenment ideals of reason and progress. Advocates criticize both left-wing "doomerism" (e.g., fears of overpopulation or inevitable climate catastrophe) and right-wing traditionalism that resists change. Instead, they push for a "frontier" mentality, emphasizing exploration, risk-taking, and abundance as moral imperatives [2]. This is evident in manifestos that call for rebuilding societal energy through technology, viewing stagnation as a policy choice rather than an inevitability [1][2].

4. **Examples and Proponents**: Modern exemplars include tech leaders like Elon Musk, who advocates for space exploration and free speech while critiquing left-wing excesses, and Marc Andreessen, whose writings frame technology as a liberating force against regulatory capture [2]. Politically, it aligns with figures like Vivek Ramaswamy or certain "national conservative" movements that support industrial policy for strategic sectors (e.g., semiconductors) but oppose welfare-state expansion [1][5]. In policy terms, this might manifest as support for nuclear energy deregulation, immigration reforms favoring high-skilled workers, or aggressive antitrust actions against "woke capital" while defending free enterprise.

### Historical and Broader Context
The term "right-wing progressivism" echoes early 20th-century movements, such as the Progressive Era in the U.S., where conservatives like Roosevelt pursued reforms to strengthen the nation-state and economy without embracing socialism [4]. Today, it's often framed as a response to the perceived failures of neoliberalism and left-progressivism, particularly post-2008 financial crisis and amid rising populism. Critics argue it risks exacerbating inequality or environmental harm by prioritizing unchecked growth, while supporters see it as essential for countering global threats like authoritarianism from China [1][2]. Additional analyses suggest it's part of a broader "post-liberal" shift, where right-leaning thinkers adopt progressive tools (e.g., state intervention in markets) for conservative ends [5].

This ideology is not monolithic and continues to evolve, often debated in online spaces like Substack and Twitter. For a deeper dive, the provided sources offer foundational perspectives, with Lyons providing a critical overview and Andreessen exemplifying its optimistic core.
