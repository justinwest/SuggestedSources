Right-wing Progressivism represents a political ideology that combines traditional conservative values with an embrace of technological advancement, economic dynamism, and forward-looking optimism about human progress. This movement seeks to reclaim the concept of "progress" from the political left while maintaining core right-leaning principles around markets, individual liberty, and national strength.

## Core Characteristics

Right-wing Progressivism is fundamentally characterized by what Marc Andreessen describes as "techno-optimism" - a belief that technology, markets, and human ingenuity can solve major societal challenges [1]. This ideology embraces rapid technological change and economic growth as inherently beneficial forces that should be accelerated rather than regulated or constrained.

The movement explicitly rejects what it sees as left-wing "degrowth" philosophies and regulatory overreach that stifles innovation [1]. Instead, it advocates for unleashing entrepreneurial energy and technological development as pathways to greater prosperity and human flourishing.

## Intellectual Foundations

According to N.S. Lyons, right-wing Progressivism emerged as a response to the perceived failure of traditional conservatism to offer compelling visions for the future [2]. While conventional conservatism often focused on preserving existing institutions or returning to past arrangements, right-wing Progressives argue for boldly advancing toward a technologically enhanced future guided by market mechanisms rather than central planning.

This ideology draws inspiration from historical figures who combined pro-business attitudes with optimism about progress, while rejecting the cultural progressivism associated with contemporary liberalism [2]. It seeks to separate technological and economic advancement from social progressive causes.

## Policy Implications

Right-wing Progressives typically advocate for:

- Aggressive deregulation to accelerate technological innovation
- Massive infrastructure investments to support emerging technologies
- Pro-natalist policies to ensure sufficient human capital for continued growth
- Strong intellectual property protections to incentivize innovation
- Reduced bureaucratic barriers to entrepreneurship and risk-taking [1]

The movement also tends to support what Andreessen calls "technological sovereignty" - ensuring that democratic nations maintain leadership in critical technologies rather than ceding ground to authoritarian competitors [1].

## Tensions and Criticisms

Critics argue that right-wing Progressivism may be internally contradictory, attempting to embrace rapid change while maintaining conservative social values [2]. There are also questions about whether this ideology adequately addresses potential negative consequences of unchecked technological advancement or growing inequality.

Additionally, some traditional conservatives view the movement's enthusiasm for disruption as incompatible with conservative principles of prudence and institutional preservation [2].
