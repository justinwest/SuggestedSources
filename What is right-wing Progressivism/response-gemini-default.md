Right-wing progressivism, also known as national progressivism, is a political ideology that combines a belief in social and economic progress with right-wing principles such as nationalism, social order, and traditionalism. It is a historically significant but less common contemporary term that describes a political faction that believes in using the power of a strong, centralized state for social reform. However, unlike left-wing progressivism, the goal of these reforms is not to advance egalitarianism or individual liberty, but to strengthen the nation, promote social cohesion, and maintain a hierarchical social order [1, 2].

The ideology appears contradictory, as modern conservatism often champions limited government and free markets, while progressivism advocates for state intervention. Right-wing progressivism resolves this by viewing the state as the primary instrument for achieving national greatness and social stability, making it distinct from both libertarian-style conservatism and socialist-style progressivism.

### Key Characteristics

1.  **Nationalism and a Strong State:** The core of right-wing progressivism is a fervent nationalism. It holds that the primary purpose of government is to advance the interests and power of the nation-state. "Progress" is measured by the nation's strength, unity, and global standing. This requires a powerful, centralized government capable of directing the economy, military, and society toward national goals [3].

2.  **Social Paternalism and Welfare:** Right-wing progressives support state-sponsored social welfare programs, such as public education, health insurance, and pensions. However, this support is rooted in paternalism rather than a belief in social equality. The goal is to create a healthier, more efficient, and more loyal populace that is less susceptible to the appeal of revolutionary ideas like socialism or communism. By providing a social safety net, the state aims to bind the working class to the nation and ensure social stability [2, 4].

3.  **Technocracy and Elitism:** Similar to their left-wing counterparts, right-wing progressives believe in governance by experts, or technocracy. They argue that a skilled elite, unburdened by populist sentiment or partisan squabbles, is best equipped to manage the complexities of a modern industrial society. This elite is expected to guide the nation toward efficiency and strength, reinforcing a natural social hierarchy [1].

4.  **Economic Interventionism and Protectionism:** Right-wing progressivism is fundamentally opposed to laissez-faire capitalism. It advocates for state intervention in the economy to serve the national interest. This includes regulating key industries, breaking up monopolies or trusts that are deemed inefficient or disloyal to the nation, and implementing protectionist trade policies (like tariffs) to shield domestic industries from foreign competition [3]. The economy is seen as a tool for building national power, not an end in itself.

5.  **Emphasis on Social Order and Cohesion:** This ideology places a high value on a unified national culture and social order. It can be hostile to forces seen as divisive, such as class conflict, radical individualism, and sometimes, unassimilated minority groups. The "progress" it seeks is one of orderly, managed change that reinforces a common national identity [5].

### Historical Examples

*   **Otto von Bismarck (Germany):** The 19th-century German Chancellor is often cited as a foundational figure. In the 1880s, Bismarck implemented the world's first comprehensive welfare state, including health insurance, accident insurance, and old-age pensions. His stated motivation was explicitly conservative: to undercut the growing popularity of the Social Democratic Party and foster the loyalty of German workers to the newly unified German Empire. He used "progressive" tools for nationalist and anti-socialist ends [4].

*   **Theodore Roosevelt (United States):** As a leader of the American Progressive Era, Theodore Roosevelt embodied many tenets of right-wing progressivism. He was a staunch nationalist who believed in expanding American power abroad ("speak softly and carry a big stick"). Domestically, he was a "trust buster" who fought corporate monopolies, a conservationist who established national parks to preserve national resources, and a proponent of regulations like the Pure Food and Drug Act. His progressivism was driven by a desire to make the United States a more efficient, powerful, and orderly nation, capable of competing on the world stage, rather than a commitment to social equality [1, 3].

### Distinction from Other Ideologies

*   **Left-Wing Progressivism:** While both use the state as an agent of change, their goals differ fundamentally. Left-wing progressivism typically aims for social justice, greater equality, minority rights, and international cooperation. Right-wing progressivism uses reform to achieve national unity, social order, and international dominance [5].

*   **Laissez-Faire Conservatism/Libertarianism:** Right-wing progressivism is the antithesis of the small-government, free-market conservatism that became dominant in the latter half of the 20th century. It embraces a powerful, interventionist state, which libertarians and classical liberals view as a threat to individual freedom and economic prosperity.

*   **Fascism:** Some scholars argue that right-wing progressivism was a historical precursor to fascism, as both ideologies champion nationalism, a strong state, and social engineering. However, a crucial distinction is that historical right-wing progressivism (like Roosevelt's) operated within a democratic framework. Fascism takes these ideas to a totalitarian extreme, demanding the complete subjugation of the individual to the state, eliminating democratic processes, and employing revolutionary violence to achieve its aims [2].

### Modern Relevance

The term "right-wing progressivism" is rarely used today. However, its ideological impulses can be seen in various contemporary political movements. "National conservatism," for example, combines strong nationalism and social traditionalism with economic protectionism and a willingness to use state power to support national industries and traditional family structures. Similarly, some populist movements blend promises of social benefits for the "native" population with anti-globalist, nationalist, and anti-immigration rhetoric, reflecting the historical synthesis of state-led reform and right-wing goals [5].

    *   Gould's work details how Theodore Roosevelt's progressive reforms were intertwined with his nationalist vision. He argues that Roosevelt’s actions—from trust-busting to conservation—were primarily motivated by his desire to create a stronger, more efficient, and globally competitive American nation-state, rather than a philosophy of social egalitarianism.

    *   Sternhell traces the intellectual roots of fascism, arguing that it emerged from a synthesis of anti-materialist, nationalist sentiments on the right and a revisionist, anti-Marxist form of socialism on the left. He views this fusion as a revolutionary "third way" that shares some structural similarities with right-wing progressive thought, such as the use of state power for national renewal, but takes it in a much more radical and totalitarian direction.

    *   Lind analyzes the historical development of American political economy and identifies a "Hamiltonian" tradition of national-developmentalism that aligns with right-wing progressivism. He describes figures like Theodore Roosevelt as advancing a form of progressivism that used a strong federal government to promote national industry and power, contrasting it with the more populist or libertarian traditions in American history.

    *   Steinberg's biography provides a detailed account of Bismarck's political maneuvering, including his creation of the German welfare state. The author emphasizes that these pioneering social reforms were a pragmatic and conservative strategy to co-opt the socialist movement and unify the German population under the authority of the Prussian-led monarchy and state.

    *   While not using the term "right-wing progressive," Hazony articulates a modern philosophy of national conservatism that echoes its themes. He advocates for a world of independent nation-states that use government power to cultivate their specific traditions, protect their industries, and maintain social cohesion, standing in direct opposition to what he calls the "imperialist" ideals of globalist liberalism and progressive universalism.
