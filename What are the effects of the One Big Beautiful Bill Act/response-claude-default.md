I was unable to find any legislation specifically called the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" in my knowledge base or through searching for this exact title. This appears to be either a colloquial reference to a different piece of legislation, a proposed bill that didn't advance significantly through the legislative process, or possibly a misremembered title.

The phrase "one big beautiful bill" was notably used by former President Donald Trump when referring to various legislative proposals during his presidency, but this was typically used as a descriptive phrase rather than as an official bill title [1]. Trump used this language when discussing potential comprehensive legislation on topics like infrastructure, healthcare, or tax reform.

Without being able to identify the specific legislation you're referring to, I cannot provide an accurate summary of its effects. If you could provide additional context about:

- The approximate time period when this bill was proposed or passed
- The policy area it addressed (healthcare, infrastructure, etc.)
- Alternative names or titles it might have had
- The legislative body that considered it

I would be better able to help identify the correct legislation and summarize its actual or projected effects.
