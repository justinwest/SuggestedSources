# What is antidepressant discontinuation syndrome?

Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (ADS) is a cluster of physical and psychological symptoms that can appear when an antidepressant is stopped suddenly, its dose is reduced too quickly, or (less often) a few doses are missed after at least several weeks of continuous treatment [1][2].

1. Typical symptoms  
   • Flu-like feelings (fatigue, muscle aches, sweats)  
   • Insomnia or vivid dreams  
   • Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea  
   • Imbalance (dizziness, vertigo, gait unsteadiness)  
   • Sensory disturbances (paraesthesias, “brain-zaps,” electric-shock sensations)  
   • Hyperarousal (anxiety, irritability, agitation)  
   The mnemonic “F-I-N-I-S-H” is often used to recall the above features [1][2].

2. Onset and duration  
   • Symptoms usually begin within 2–5 days of the last dose (sooner with short half-life drugs, later with long half-life drugs such as fluoxetine) [1][2].  
   • In most people they resolve within 1–3 weeks, but a minority experience protracted symptoms lasting many weeks or months [3].

3. Frequency and risk factors  
   • Around 20–50 % of patients report some discontinuation symptoms, and about 5–10 % describe them as severe [2].  
   • Higher risk is seen with abrupt cessation, high doses, longer duration of treatment, a prior history of ADS, and drugs with short half-lives (e.g., paroxetine, venlafaxine) [1][2].

4. Proposed mechanism  
   Long-term exposure to antidepressants causes adaptive changes in monoamine (serotonin, norepinephrine) receptors and downstream signalling. Sudden dose reduction leaves synapses temporarily “under-supplied,” resulting in the transient symptoms of ADS until homeostasis is restored [2].

5. ADS versus relapse of depression  
   • Timing: ADS starts within days; relapse typically emerges gradually over weeks to months.  
   • Symptom profile: ADS includes prominent physical and sensory symptoms that are uncommon in depressive relapse.  
   • Course: ADS is self-limited once the brain readjusts; relapse persists or worsens without renewed treatment [1][3].

6. Prevention and management  
   • Taper gradually—common recommendations are to reduce the dose by 10–25 % every 2–4 weeks, slowing further as the dose gets lower, though schedules must be individualised [3].  
   • Consider switching to a longer-half-life antidepressant (e.g., fluoxetine) before tapering if the current drug has a short half-life [1][2].  
   • If troublesome symptoms occur, either pause the taper, reinstate the previous effective dose and taper more slowly, or provide symptomatic treatments (e.g., anti-nausea agents, sleep aids) [1][2].  
   • Educate patients in advance; knowing that symptoms are time-limited reduces distress and helps distinguish ADS from relapse [3].

Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is therefore a predictable, generally time-limited withdrawal phenomenon that can be minimised—though not always entirely eliminated—by careful, patient-centred dose reduction.
