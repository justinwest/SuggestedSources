# What is antidepressant discontinuation syndrome?

Definition  
Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (ADS), sometimes called antidepressant withdrawal syndrome, is a constellation of physical and psychological symptoms that can appear after dose reduction or abrupt cessation of an antidepressant taken for ≥4–6 weeks. It reflects an acute neurochemical disequilibrium triggered by sudden loss of the drug’s pharmacologic effects and is generally self-limited, but it can be distressing and impairing.

Incidence and epidemiology  
• Occurs in approximately 20–40 % of patients who stop or markedly reduce an antidepressant, though rates vary widely with drug class, half-life, tapering method, and individual vulnerability.  
• Most cases are mild to moderate; severe or prolonged courses are uncommon.  
• Under-recognition is common, leading to misdiagnosis as relapse or other illness.

Risk factors  
• Short elimination half-life (e.g., paroxetine, venlafaxine, duloxetine, immediate-release formulations).  
• High receptor affinity and anticholinergic or noradrenergic properties (increase symptom likelihood).  
• Long duration of treatment and/or high dose.  
• Abrupt cessation or rapid taper (<7–14 days).  
• Prior history of ADS.  
• Younger age and possibly female sex (data mixed).

Typical onset, duration, and course  
• Onset: 1–3 days after stopping a short half-life drug; may be delayed up to 1–2 weeks with longer half-life agents (e.g., fluoxetine).  
• Duration: Usually 1–2 weeks; can last 3–6 weeks. In a minority, especially after multiple unsuccessful reinstatement attempts, symptoms may persist for months (protracted withdrawal).  
• Reinstating the antidepressant (often at a lower dose) usually leads to rapid improvement within 24–72 h.

Clinical presentation  
A widely used mnemonic is FINISH:  
F – Flu-like symptoms: fatigue, myalgias, sweating, headache, chills.  
I – Insomnia and vivid dreams.  
N – Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  
I – Imbalance: dizziness, vertigo, ataxia; “brain zaps” or electric-shock sensations.  
S – Sensory disturbances: paresthesias, visual changes, tinnitus.  
H – Hyperarousal/hyperemotionality: anxiety, irritability, agitation; less commonly dysphoria or crying spells.  

Additional features: tremor, movement disorders, orthostasis, blurred vision, anorexia, crying spells, depersonalization, mania/hypomania (rare). Psychotic symptoms are very rare and usually reflect underlying disorder or substance use.

Pathophysiology (proposed mechanisms)  
• Down-regulation and desensitization of monoamine (serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine) receptors while on treatment is abruptly unmet when the drug is removed, causing a temporary deficit.  
• Compensatory neuroadaptations in ion channels, second-messenger systems, and neuropeptides create a “withdrawal rebound” until homeostasis is re-established.  
• Anticholinergic rebound, particularly with tricyclics and paroxetine, contributes to gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms.  
• Noradrenergic overactivity may cause autonomic instability (tachycardia, sweating, anxiety).

Drugs with highest versus lowest risk  
High: paroxetine, venlafaxine (especially IR), duloxetine, desvenlafaxine, fluvoxamine, clomipramine, TCAs in general, MAOIs.  
Intermediate: sertraline, escitalopram, citalopram, levomilnacipran.  
Low: fluoxetine (long half-life, active metabolite), vortioxetine, trazodone, mirtazapine, bupropion (though may cause stimulant-like rebound).  

Differential diagnosis  
• Relapse/recurrence of major depressive or anxiety disorder.  
• Medication side-effect from newly started agents.  
• Viral illness or other medical condition (inner-ear disorder, anemia, thyroid disease).  
• Substance withdrawal or intoxication (e.g., benzodiazepines, alcohol, stimulants).  
Clues favoring ADS: rapid onset after dose change, multiplicity of somatic and sensory symptoms, “brain zaps,” rapid resolution upon drug reinstatement, absence of pervasive anhedonia or hopelessness typical of depressive relapse.

Prevention  
1. Patient education before initiation and again before discontinuation.  
2. Slow, individualized taper—commonly 5–10 % dose reduction every 1–4 weeks; slower for high-risk drugs and long-term users.  
3. Switching to a long half-life antidepressant (e.g., fluoxetine) before final taper can mitigate symptoms (“Prozac bridge”).  
4. Adjunctive nonpharmacologic measures: sleep hygiene, hydration, light exercise, stress-management techniques.

Management  
• Reinstate the previous therapeutic dose or the lowest dose that improves symptoms; then restart a slower taper.  
• Symptomatic treatments:  
  – Vestibular suppressants (meclizine, dimenhydrinate) for vertigo.  
  – Non-sedating or sedating antihistamines for nausea or insomnia.  
  – NSAIDs or acetaminophen for headache or myalgias.  
  – Benzodiazepines, propranolol, or hydroxyzine short-term for severe anxiety.  
  – Ondansetron or metoclopramide for persistent GI upset.  
• Psychosocial support and reassurance regarding the benign and self-limited nature of the syndrome.  
• Monitor for emergence of suicidality or relapse; treat underlying disorder as needed.

Special populations  
Pregnancy: Neonates exposed to SSRIs late in gestation can develop a self-limited withdrawal/startle syndrome after birth; tapering late in pregnancy is not routinely recommended if maternal depression risk is high.  
Pediatrics: Children and adolescents may experience similar or more intense symptoms; careful parental education essential.  
Geriatrics: Polypharmacy raises diagnostic confusion; slower tapers advised due to altered pharmacokinetics.

Prognosis  
• Full recovery is the rule when ADS is recognized and managed.  
• It does not predict poor long-term response to antidepressants; however, distress may deter future adherence.  
• Protracted or complicated cases warrant specialist referral.

Key counseling points for patients  
• Do not stop antidepressants abruptly without consulting a clinician.  
• A slow, stepwise taper minimizes discomfort.  
• If symptoms appear, they are usually temporary and not a sign of “going crazy.”  
• Contact your clinician if symptoms are severe, persist beyond a few days, or include suicidal thoughts.
