# What is antidepressant discontinuation syndrome?

Definition  
Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (ADS) is a constellation of physical and psychological symptoms that can emerge after an antidepressant is abruptly stopped, tapered too quickly, or—less commonly—when doses are missed. The syndrome is usually transient and benign but can be distressing and occasionally mistaken for relapse of the underlying psychiatric illness.

Incidence and Risk Factors  
• Occurs in roughly 20–40 % of patients who discontinue an antidepressant; rates vary by drug class and study design.  
• Highest risk with agents that have short elimination half-lives (e.g., paroxetine, venlafaxine, immediate-release fluvoxamine).  
• Lower risk with long half-life agents (e.g., fluoxetine) and those that are tapered slowly.  
• Additional risk factors: high doses, long treatment duration, prior ADS episodes, younger age, and concomitant medications that increase metabolic clearance.

Typical Time Course  
• Onset: 1–7 days after dose reduction or cessation (may be delayed up to 2 weeks with fluoxetine).  
• Duration: Most cases resolve within 1–3 weeks; a minority last several months if not treated.  
• Symptoms generally improve rapidly (hours to days) after re-introducing the antidepressant or starting another with cross-taper.

Clinical Features (“FINISH” mnemonic)  
F – Flu-like symptoms (malaise, myalgias, fatigue, headache, sweating)  
I – Insomnia (or vivid dreams, nightmares)  
N – Nausea (plus vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps)  
I – Imbalance (dizziness, vertigo, gait instability)  
S – Sensory disturbances (“brain zaps,” paresthesias, visual flashes, tinnitus)  
H – Hyperarousal (anxiety, irritability, agitation)  

Other manifestations: tremor, chills, crying spells, mood lability, depersonalization, difficulty concentrating, hallucinations (rare).

Pathophysiology  
Exact mechanisms remain uncertain. Leading theories involve:  
• Rapid decline in synaptic serotonin and norepinephrine causing acute receptor disequilibrium.  
• Down-regulation or desensitization of postsynaptic receptors during long-term therapy, followed by sudden up-regulation when the drug is withdrawn.  
• Altered activity in cholinergic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic systems; possible transient HPA axis changes.  

Differential Diagnosis  
• Relapse or recurrence of depression/anxiety (usually develops weeks to months after stopping, not days).  
• Pharmacokinetic withdrawal from other CNS drugs (benzodiazepines, opioids).  
• Viral illness or vestibular disorder.  
• Mania or hypomania (if antidepressant tapered while mood stabilizer absent).

Management  
1. Prevention  
   – Plan discontinuation in advance, preferably when the patient is euthymic and medically stable.  
   – Gradual taper: decrease dose by 10–25 % every 1–4 weeks; slower for short half-life agents or long-term/high-dose users.  
   – Switch to fluoxetine or a longer-acting formulation before tapering for high-risk cases.  

2. Acute treatment  
   – Reinstate the previous effective dose (or substitute an equivalent SSRI/SNRI) and taper more slowly once symptom-free.  
   – Symptomatic relief: antiemetics, NSAIDs for myalgias, antihistamines for insomnia, clonidine or gabapentin for severe anxiety or “brain zaps” (evidence limited).  
   – Patient education and reassurance; symptoms are self-limiting.

Special Populations  
• Pregnancy: taper cautiously; weigh fetal exposure risk against maternal relapse.  
• Pediatrics: higher incidence of behavioral symptoms; taper even more gradually.  
• Older adults: may have more pronounced balance issues; monitor fall risk.

Prognosis  
• Excellent. ADS is not dangerous in most cases and resolves completely with time or appropriate management.  
• It does not predict future treatment resistance but may affect adherence; thorough patient counseling reduces fear and improves long-term outcomes.

Patient Education Points  
• Never stop an antidepressant abruptly without clinician guidance.  
• Keep a small supply of medication in case of travel or lapses.  
• Distinguish ADS from recurrence: ADS appears quickly and improves in days once the drug is re-taken; relapse is slower and persistent.  
• Contact a healthcare professional if symptoms are severe, prolonged, or uncertain.

Key Takeaway  
Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is a short-lived withdrawal phenomenon, most common with short half-life agents and abrupt cessation. It can be minimized by gradual tapering, patient education, and prompt symptom-targeted management when it occurs.
