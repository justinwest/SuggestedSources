**Woke** is an adjective that originally means being “awake” to social injustices and racial discrimination – in other words, being keenly aware of systemic inequities and prejudices in society ([www.merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/woke#:~:text=1)) ([www.merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wokeness#:~:text=woke%C2%B7%E2%80%8Bness%20%CB%88w%C5%8Dk)). The term comes from African American Vernacular English; to “stay woke” in Black communities historically meant to remain alert to racial bias and injustice. Early uses of *woke* in this context go back to the mid-20th century. For example, in 1962 the African-American novelist William Melvin Kelley used *woke* in a New York Times essay explaining black slang (“If you’re woke, you dig it”), signaling that *woke* meant socially conscious or aware ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=The%20Economist%20writes%20that%20the,%E2%80%9D)). The idea of waking up to unjust realities also appeared in activism of the 1970s – a character in a 1972 play about Marcus Garvey declares he was “sleeping” until enlightened and now vows to “stay woke” to help awaken others ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=A%20decade%20later%2C%20a%20character,wake%20up%20other%20black%20folk%E2%80%9D)). In essence, *woke* came to describe an alertness to racial or social discrimination and the need for action against it. **Wokeness**, as a noun, refers to the state of being “woke” – that is, a broad awareness of social injustices and a commitment to addressing them ([www.merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wokeness#:~:text=woke%C2%B7%E2%80%8Bness%20%CB%88w%C5%8Dk)). It can also denote the broader *ideology or movement* centered on such social consciousness.

In modern usage, *woke* and *wokeness* entered the mainstream during the 2010s amid rising social justice movements. The phrase “stay woke” was popularized in 2014 during the Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson, Missouri, as a caution to remain watchful for racial injustice (particularly police brutality) ([www.vox.com](https://www.vox.com/culture/21437879/stay-woke-wokeness-history-origin-evolution-controversy#:~:text=Before%202014%2C%20the%20call%20to,brutality%20and%20unjust%20police%20tactics)) ([www.vox.com](https://www.vox.com/culture/21437879/stay-woke-wokeness-history-origin-evolution-controversy#:~:text=staying%20%E2%80%9Cwoke%E2%80%9D%20and%20alert%20to,brutality%20and%20unjust%20police%20tactics)). Through social media and activism, *woke* evolved from African-American slang into a wider colloquial term signaling awareness of issues like racism, sexism, and other forms of inequality. By the late 2010s, major dictionaries had recognized this shift. For instance, in 2017 the Oxford English Dictionary added *woke* in its new sense, defining it as “alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice” ([time.com](https://time.com/4830959/oxford-english-dictionary-woke/#:~:text=%3E%20woke%2C%20adjective%3A%20Originally%3A%20well,injustice%3B%20frequently%20in%20stay%20woke)). Similarly, Merriam-Webster’s dictionary defines *woke* as “aware of and actively attentive to important facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice)” ([www.merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/woke#:~:text=1)). Originally rooted in racial justice, the term broadened to encompass a generalized left-leaning social awareness, including causes such as gender equality and LGBTQ+ rights ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke#:~:text=political%20connotations%20by%20the%201970s,slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States)) ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=adjective,with%20race%20and%20more%20ideology)). In other words, being *“woke”* in today’s context means being informed about social inequalities and supportive of efforts to address them.

However, *woke* has also become a contested term with different connotations depending on who uses it. On the political left or among progressives, *woke* is often used positively to signify a heightened consciousness about social injustice and a proactive stance in fighting inequality ([www.vox.com](https://www.vox.com/culture/21437879/stay-woke-wokeness-history-origin-evolution-controversy#:~:text=leftist%20culture%20by%20the%20right)). To call oneself *woke* (or to be called woke) in this sense implies one is socially aware, empathetic toward marginalized groups, and committed to progressive reform. Advocates see *wokeness* as an extension of moral vigilance – a virtue signaling one’s dedication to fairness and inclusion. For example, psychologist Michael Karson describes wokeness as fundamentally *“a good thing”* – an awareness of unfairness that makes society better by fostering empathy for the marginalized ([www.psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/feeling-our-way/202108/the-psychology-wokeism?amp=#:~:text=Wokeness%2C%20in%20my%20view%2C%20is,to%20live%20in%20for%20everyone)). In this view, *wokeness* means actively remaining informed about issues like racial bias, MeToo and gender inequality, or LGBTQ discrimination, and supporting measures to remedy these injustices. Those who embrace the term often consider it synonymous with social justice consciousness and view it as a **moral duty** to “stay woke” in order to challenge systemic ills ([www.vox.com](https://www.vox.com/culture/21437879/stay-woke-wokeness-history-origin-evolution-controversy#:~:text=On%20the%20left%2C%20to%20be,Consider%20the%20%204%202020)) ([www.psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/feeling-our-way/202108/the-psychology-wokeism?amp=#:~:text=Wokeness%2C%20in%20my%20view%2C%20is,to%20live%20in%20for%20everyone)). 

In contrast, many conservative and centrist voices now use *“woke”* as a pejorative term. On the political right, *woke* is often deployed sarcastically or derogatorily to label what they perceive as overzealous or misguided progressive culture ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=Hide%20Ad)) ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=%E2%80%9COn%20the%20right%2C%20%E2%80%9Cwoke%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%94,%E2%80%9D)). Critics argue that *wokeness* in practice can amount to performative activism, excessive “political correctness,” or even an irrational ideology. For instance, they point to instances of “cancel culture” and say that *woke* ideals enforce a strict conformity of language and thought ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=In%20recent%20years%2C%20the%20word,health%20consequences%20can%20be%20dangerous)) ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=progressive%20activism%20has%20been%20widely,by%20many%20over%20the%20years)). The term *“woke”* in conservative usage has become a catch-all for a range of modern progressive positions – from diversity and inclusion initiatives to debates about gender identity – all of which are viewed skeptically as extreme or ill-founded. Prominent right-wing figures have openly condemned *wokeness* as a damaging force: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, for example, calls *“the woke mind virus”* a *“war on merit”* and *“a war on achievement,”* claiming that woke ideology undermines traditional values and objective standards ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=As%20with%20many%20cultural%20phenomena,%E2%80%9D)) ([www.telegraph.co.uk](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/05/25/ron-desantis-interview-disney-covid-war-on-wokery/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWoke%20ideologyundermines%20merit%20and%20achievement,%E2%80%9D)). By 2019, it was common for opponents to use *woke* as an insult, suggesting someone is a self-righteous “social justice warrior” or engaging in shallow virtue-signaling ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke#:~:text=By%202019%2C%20the%20term%20was,progressive%20messaging%20for%20financial%20gain)) ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=In%20short%2C%20it%20is%20bipartisan%3A,by%20misguided%20or%20performative%20activism)). In this sense, being labeled *woke* by others can imply one is part of an illiberal leftist orthodoxy or that one’s awareness of social issues is performative and not based in practical reality ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=In%20short%2C%20it%20is%20bipartisan%3A,by%20misguided%20or%20performative%20activism)). Indeed, to these critics *wokeness* has come to represent *“political correctness gone awry”* ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=%E2%80%9COn%20the%20right%2C%20%E2%80%9Cwoke%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%94,%E2%80%9D)) – an ideology that they argue stifles free speech, erodes meritocracy, and even *“corrupts”* institutions by prioritizing identity politics over competence or truth ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=As%20with%20many%20cultural%20phenomena,%E2%80%9D)) ([www.telegraph.co.uk](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/05/25/ron-desantis-interview-disney-covid-war-on-wokery/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWoke%20ideologyundermines%20merit%20and%20achievement,%E2%80%9D)).

Beyond the polarized political battle over the term, there is also debate about the sincerity and impact of *wokeness*. Some observers (including moderate liberals and left-wing commentators) have cautioned that *wokeness* can sometimes devolve into empty posturing or intolerance, betraying the term’s original ideals. For example, **Michael Karson** warns that every social movement faces the risk of becoming what it hates; in his view, *“wokeness”* can slide into **“wokeism,”** a rigid mindset **“characterized by intolerance, policing the speech of others, and proving one’s own superiority by denouncing others,”** rather than true compassion ([www.psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/feeling-our-way/202108/the-psychology-wokeism?amp=#:~:text=On%20the%20political%20left%2C%20wokeness,others%20have%20written%20extensively%20about)) ([www.psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/feeling-our-way/202108/the-psychology-wokeism?amp=#:~:text=On%20the%20political%20left%2C%20wokeness,others%20have%20written%20extensively%20about)). This critique suggests that some self-identified *woke* activists may focus on performatively shaming or “cancelling” others to display moral purity, instead of effecting meaningful change ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=In%20recent%20years%2C%20the%20word,health%20consequences%20can%20be%20dangerous)) ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20there%20are%20those%20in,moves%20or%20rhetoric%20gone%20awry)). Additionally, the mainstreaming of *woke* rhetoric has led to instances of corporate and political opportunism. Companies have been accused of *“woke-washing”* or *“woke capitalism”* – adopting superficial progressive branding (such as rainbow logos during Pride Month or diverse marketing campaigns) while avoiding substantive changes, a practice that brings its own backlash ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=performative%20activism)) ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=As%20Psychology%20Today%20wrote%3A%20%E2%80%9CIn,by%20many%20over%20the%20years)). Such examples feed the argument that *wokeness* can sometimes be hollow or hypocritical, which even some proponents of social justice find concerning. 

In summary, **“woke”** can either be a badge of awareness or an epithet, depending on context. *Woke* began as a term urging people to stay alert to racial and social injustices, and many still use it to denote a praiseworthy consciousness of inequality and commitment to reform [1][5]. At the same time, *wokeness* has evolved into a broader concept – often politicized – that some celebrate as enlightened progressive values and others deride as an overzealous, even detrimental, trend [2][3]. The divergence in meaning is so pronounced that one writer observed *“what ‘woke’ means depends on who’s defining it.”* ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=Being%20conscious%20and%20aware%2C%20embracing,depends%20on%20who%E2%80%99s%20defining%20it)) For supporters, wokeness means being *morally awake* to injustice and striving for a more equitable society. For its critics, *woke* has become shorthand for a pretentious or extreme brand of progressivism divorced from common sense. As a result, the term sits at the center of contemporary culture wars, with *“woke”* and *“anti-woke”* camps using it as a rallying cry on opposite sides of debates. In effect, *woke* and *wokeness* encapsulate a ongoing conflict over social values – either representing the pursuit of social justice or, conversely, a subject of scorn for those who feel that pursuit has gone too far [2][4]. The meaning continues to evolve, but at its core *to be woke* still implies a call to **awareness** – whether one views that as a virtue or a vice.

Kelley and later gained prominence through Black activism (e.g. the phrase “stay woke” during the 2014 Ferguson protests). He explains that *“woke”* now means different things to different people: supporters see it as being conscious of injustice and morally *virtuous*, whereas critics regard *wokeness* as *“political correctness gone awry”* or *hollow, performative activism* ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=In%20short%2C%20it%20is%20bipartisan%3A,by%20misguided%20or%20performative%20activism)) ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=%E2%80%9COn%20the%20right%2C%20%E2%80%9Cwoke%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%94,%E2%80%9D)).

3. **Aja Romano (Vox, 2020)** – Chronicles how *“woke”* was popularized as a watchword by Black Lives Matter and then co-opted into the broader culture war. Romano writes that within a few years *woke* *“evolved into a single-word summation of leftist political ideology, centered on social justice politics and critical race theory.”* She notes that the term became **bipartisan** in usage: progressives embraced *“woke”* in a positive light (as shorthand for being socially aware and progressive), while conservatives turned *“woke”* into a derogatory meme used to denigrate the left ([www.vox.com](https://www.vox.com/culture/21437879/stay-woke-wokeness-history-origin-evolution-controversy#:~:text=In%20the%20six%20years%20since,leftist%20culture%20by%20the%20right)).

4. **Ron DeSantis (quoted in The Scotsman, 2023)** – Illustrates a prominent **conservative** anti-woke perspective. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has repeatedly attacked *“wokeness”* as a dangerous ideology; he is quoted as saying *“The woke mind virus represents a war on merit [and] a war on achievement.”* ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=As%20with%20many%20cultural%20phenomena,%E2%80%9D)). This encapsulates the view on the right that *woke* policies undermine traditional values like meritocracy and truth. DeSantis’s stance, including measures like the Florida “Stop WOKE Act,” treats *wokeness* as something to be defeated in order to preserve what he views as common-sense standards.

5. **Michael Karson (Psychology Today, 2021)** – Offers a nuanced critique from a centrist-liberal viewpoint. Karson argues that *“wokeness”* – defined as heightened awareness of others’ unfair treatment and empathy for the marginalized – is fundamentally positive and would improve society. *However*, he cautions that it can morph into *“wokeism,”* a dogmatic form of self-righteousness. On the *“political left,”* he observes, *wokeness* sometimes *“drifts into wokeism — a system of thought and behavior characterized by intolerance, policing the speech of others, and proving one’s own superiority by denouncing others.”* ([www.psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/feeling-our-way/202108/the-psychology-wokeism?amp=#:~:text=On%20the%20political%20left%2C%20wokeness,others%20have%20written%20extensively%20about)) In Karson’s view, this extreme *wokeism* betrays the inclusive ideals of wokeness by becoming exclusionary and punitive.
