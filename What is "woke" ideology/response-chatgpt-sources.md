**Definition and Origins:** *“Woke” ideology* refers to an overlapping set of beliefs and practices centered on social justice, identity-based inequality, and the need to remedy systemic injustices. The term “woke” originally entered Black American slang decades ago, meaning alertness to racial discrimination and injustice ([homeaddict.io](https://homeaddict.io/what-woke-actually-stands-for-a-balanced-exploration-of-different-viewpoints/#:~:text=Woke%20first%20appeared%20in%20African,original%20focus%20on%20racial%20awareness)). In the 2010s, it expanded beyond race to encompass issues of gender, sexuality, and other forms of perceived oppression ([homeaddict.io](https://homeaddict.io/what-woke-actually-stands-for-a-balanced-exploration-of-different-viewpoints/#:~:text=During%20the%202010s%2C%20woke%20expanded,sharp%20focus%20on%20racial%20justice)). By the late 2010s, “wokeness” or *wokism* came to denote a broader left-wing socio-political worldview. Supporters see being *woke* as fundamentally about empathy and fairness – recognizing the ongoing impacts of historical injustices and striving for an inclusive, equitable society ([www.theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/09/woke-ideology-history-origins-flaws/675454/#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20side%2C%20many,%E2%80%9D)) ([homeaddict.io](https://homeaddict.io/what-woke-actually-stands-for-a-balanced-exploration-of-different-viewpoints/#:~:text=The%20concept%20of%20woke%20centers,poverty%20since%201960)). Detractors, however, use *“woke ideology”* to describe a dogmatic or extreme form of progressivism that they believe aggressively imposes particular views about race, gender, and social justice ([www.theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/09/woke-ideology-history-origins-flaws/675454/#:~:text=Right,patriotic%20versions%20of%20American%20history)) ([johnhcochrane.blogspot.com](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/07/woke-week.html#:~:text=,cannot%20dismantle%20the%20master%E2%80%99s%20house)). In short, woke ideology is generally understood as **a belief system focused on highlighting and correcting societal injustices related to identity, often by challenging traditional norms and demanding structural change** ([www.theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/09/woke-ideology-history-origins-flaws/675454/#:~:text=Each%20position%20mischaracterizes%20these%20ideas%2C,wing)).

**Core Beliefs and Practices:**  At its core, woke ideology holds that society is pervaded by systemic inequalities – in race, gender, sexuality, etc. – that must be acknowledged and confronted. Being “woke” entails a heightened awareness of how power and privilege create disparities, and a moral obligation to call out and dismantle these injustices ([homeaddict.io](https://homeaddict.io/what-woke-actually-stands-for-a-balanced-exploration-of-different-viewpoints/#:~:text=Woke%20thinking%20frames%20society%20as,of%20personal%20responsibility%20and%20effort)) ([homeaddict.io](https://homeaddict.io/what-woke-actually-stands-for-a-balanced-exploration-of-different-viewpoints/#:~:text=According%20to%20woke%20thought%2C%20factors,character%E2%80%9D%20rather%20than%20demographic%20categories)). Key tenets include the idea that seemingly neutral systems (law, education, media, economics) actually perpetuate inequity (“systemic racism,” “patriarchy,” etc.), and that neutrality or “colorblindness” is often just a guise for complicit bias ([johnhcochrane.blogspot.com](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/07/woke-week.html#:~:text=,character%E2%80%94must%20itself%20be%20deemed%20racist)). **Language** and norms are scrutinized in the woke framework – for example, the terms used to describe groups are seen as important markers of respect or disrespect ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=real%20problem%20%E2%80%94%20the%20performativeness%2C,words%20to%20talk%20about%20them)). Woke discourse often emphasizes *identity politics* and *intersectionality*, asserting that an individual’s overlapping identities (race, gender, class, etc.) inform their experience of oppression or privilege ([homeaddict.io](https://homeaddict.io/what-woke-actually-stands-for-a-balanced-exploration-of-different-viewpoints/#:~:text=According%20to%20woke%20thought%2C%20factors,character%E2%80%9D%20rather%20than%20demographic%20categories)) ([homeaddict.io](https://homeaddict.io/what-woke-actually-stands-for-a-balanced-exploration-of-different-viewpoints/#:~:text=Intersectionality%20Concept)). Thus, lived experiences of marginalized groups are given priority as sources of knowledge that challenge dominant narratives. The practical outgrowths of this ideology include strong advocacy for diversity and inclusion programs, changes in language (e.g. adopting new pronouns or terminology), and policies aimed at equalizing outcomes across groups (often termed “equity” as opposed to mere equality of opportunity) ([johnhcochrane.blogspot.com](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/07/woke-week.html#:~:text=which%20is%20why%20the%20very,character%E2%80%94must%20itself%20be%20deemed%20racist)). 

Underlying these beliefs is a moral binary that categorizes society into oppressed vs. oppressor groups. Woke ideology tends to view *social issues through the lens of power dynamics*, past and present. It argues that historical injustices (like slavery, colonialism, patriarchy) have enduring effects now, requiring proactive remediation. **Traditional liberal ideals** such as meritocracy, free expression, or race-neutral laws are sometimes critiqued within this worldview as insufficient or even as enabling oppression, insofar as they might uphold an unjust status quo ([johnhcochrane.blogspot.com](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/07/woke-week.html#:~:text=,character%E2%80%94must%20itself%20be%20deemed%20racist)). For example, the once-uncontroversial goal of *colorblindness* in law or hiring is reinterpreted as problematic (“the notion of colorblindness…must itself be deemed racist” in this ideology) ([johnhcochrane.blogspot.com](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/07/woke-week.html#:~:text=,character%E2%80%94must%20itself%20be%20deemed%20racist)), because ignoring identity is seen as ignoring real patterns of disadvantage. Instead, *equity* – ensuring equal outcomes across groups – is treated as the truer measure of justice ([johnhcochrane.blogspot.com](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/07/woke-week.html#:~:text=character%E2%80%94must%20itself%20be%20deemed%20racist)). These beliefs translate into practices such as “calling out” or *canceling* those deemed to violate woke norms, on the premise that harmful language or ideas contribute to oppressive climates. In the woke framework, offensive speech is often equated with violence or trauma, while conversely certain disruptive or even aggressive actions taken *in the name of justice* are rationalized as necessary and righteous ([johnhcochrane.blogspot.com](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/07/woke-week.html#:~:text=,Excellence%20with%20equity)) ([johnhcochrane.blogspot.com](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/07/woke-week.html#:~:text=,at%20all%E2%80%94but%20in%20fact%20justice)). Overall, woke ideology preaches an urgent, action-oriented morality: one must be constantly vigilant (“stay woke”) to subtle injustices and take sides against oppression in everyday life.

**Historical Development:**  Analysts generally trace modern woke ideology to late-20th-century intellectual and cultural shifts. Many of its ideas have roots in academia – in critical race theory, postmodern and postcolonial theory, radical gender studies, and similar fields that gained influence from the 1970s onward ([www.theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/09/woke-ideology-history-origins-flaws/675454/#:~:text=Each%20position%20mischaracterizes%20these%20ideas%2C,wing)) ([www.theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/09/woke-ideology-history-origins-flaws/675454/#:~:text=At%20the%20beginning%2C%20there%20was,Michel%20Foucault)). French philosopher Michel Foucault’s skepticism of objective truth and focus on hidden power dynamics in discourse, for instance, inspired later thinkers to scrutinize language and institutions for “structural” oppression ([www.theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/09/woke-ideology-history-origins-flaws/675454/#:~:text=At%20the%20beginning%2C%20there%20was,Michel%20Foucault)) ([www.theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/09/woke-ideology-history-origins-flaws/675454/#:~:text=This%20paved%20the%20way%20for,%E2%80%9D)). By the 1980s and 1990s, U.S. universities saw the rise of what was then called *political correctness* – a drive to police language and campus culture in line with progressive sensitivities ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=2,to%20life%20in%20the%202010s)) ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=As%20for%20where%20political%20correctness,social%20sciences%20in%20the%201980s)). This first wave of “wokeness” (before the term *woke* was popularized) germinated largely in humanities and social science departments, where injecting politics into scholarship was easier than in technical fields ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=,the%20humanities%20and%20social%20sciences)) ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=As%20for%20where%20political%20correctness,social%20sciences%20in%20the%201980s)). In the 1960s, student activists had championed civil rights, women’s liberation, and anti-war causes – but they lacked institutional power. By the late 1980s, however, many of those activists had become professors or administrators, giving them the authority to infuse curricula and policies with their egalitarian and identity-focused ideals ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=5,political%20power%20several%20decades%20later)) ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=issues.%20,retire%2C%20they%20gradually%20became%20both)). As essayist Paul Graham observes, *“the 1960s radicals got tenure”* – what began as protest evolved into institutional norms, turning *“protest into punishment”* for those violating the new moral rules ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=What%20happened%3F%20How%20did%20protest,It%20was%20faculty%20members)).

This **first wave** of political correctness introduced now-familiar woke concepts (for example, condemning “sexist” or “racist” language on campus). Yet it eventually met with backlash and ridicule. By the late 1990s, people were poking fun at the excesses of P.C. culture, and this helped deflate its influence ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=1980s%20the%20politically%20correct%20tried,pretend%20this%20conflict%20didn%E2%80%99t%20exist)). Comedians and critics highlighted the *arcane, shifting rules* of correct speech – e.g. why “people of color” is acceptable but “colored people” is offensive – to show that the system lacked consistent principles ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=principles)) ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=morality%20turned%20out%20to%20be,created%20land%20mines%20for%20the)). Such rules could feel arbitrary, a “long list” one must memorize to avoid public shaming ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=morality%20turned%20out%20to%20be,created%20land%20mines%20for%20the)). By around 2000, political correctness seemed to wane, and many assumed that that wave of moralism had passed ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=10,because%20people%20started%20ridiculing%20it)).

**The Great Awokening:** The current incarnation – often just called *wokeness* – surged in the 2010s, earning the nickname “The Great Awokening” ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=11,Yglesias%20dubbed%20the%20Great%20Awokening)). Multiple factors contributed to this revival. One was the rise of social media platforms like Twitter and Tumblr, which proved to be fertile ground for outrage-driven activism and viral shaming campaigns ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=,seemed%20to%20like%20being%20outraged)). Online networks allowed minor campus controversies or isolated incidents to explode into massive public scandals, with *“cancel mobs”* uniting to demand accountability or firings ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=,seemed%20to%20like%20being%20outraged)). As one commentator noted, users seemed to *“like being outraged”* – outrage became a form of engagement and bonding online ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=,seemed%20to%20like%20being%20outraged)). Another factor was increasing political and media polarization: traditional news outlets grew more ideologically uniform and sensational online, reinforcing narratives of systemic injustice on one hand and feeding counter-narratives on the other ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=12,increasing%20polarization%20of%20the%20media)). During this period, progressive rhetoric about racism, sexism, and inequality became far more prevalent in mainstream discourse – for instance, usage of the term “racism” in major U.S. newspapers skyrocketed after 2012 ([www.city-journal.org](https://www.city-journal.org/article/wokeness-the-highest-stage-of-managerialism#:~:text=pointing%20out%20how%20far%20America,York%20Times%20leading%20the%20charge)). High-profile incidents of police violence (e.g. the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson and later George Floyd in 2020) and the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment added fuel, galvanizing public support for what were seen as overdue reckonings with racism and patriarchy.

By the mid-2010s, many of the norms that had been incubated in academia had diffused into corporate, media, and tech institutions. Diversity trainings, bias response teams, and HR-led initiatives enforcing inclusive language and behavior became common in workplaces. In effect, *wokeness became institutionalized*. Writers have noted that a new class of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) professionals emerged, **“a new class of bureaucrats [who] pursued a woke agenda as if their jobs depended on it – because they did” ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=,%E2%80%9CDEI%20statements%E2%80%9D%20that%20some%20universities)).** These administrators, sometimes likened to political commissars, gained influence in hiring and governance, pushing organizations to formally adopt woke principles and policies ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=,%E2%80%9CDEI%20statements%E2%80%9D%20that%20some%20universities)). For example, some universities began requiring faculty candidates to submit DEI statements affirming their commitment to diversity causes, a practice critics likened to ideological litmus tests ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=of%20problem%2C%20they%E2%80%99re%20going%20to,proving%20their%20commitment%20to%20wokeness)). In corporate America, large companies started taking public stands on social justice issues and implementing internal diversity quotas or sensitivity protocols – a phenomenon dubbed “woke capitalism” by skeptics. Importantly, this phase of wokeness was often *top-down* (driven by managers and officials) as much as bottom-up. Journalist Malcom Kyeyune argues that *wokeness functions as a **“managerial ideology”*** of the modern elite: it provides moral justification for expanding administrative control over organizations and society ([www.city-journal.org](https://www.city-journal.org/article/wokeness-the-highest-stage-of-managerialism#:~:text=But%20if%20Burnham%20were%20alive,reappear%20today%20in%20hypertrophied%20form)) ([www.city-journal.org](https://www.city-journal.org/article/wokeness-the-highest-stage-of-managerialism#:~:text=The%20main%20practical%20demand%20that,Another%20example%20of%20creeping)). According to this view, being woke isn’t just about personal virtue – it actively **demands** a larger bureaucratic apparatus to monitor and re-engineer social relations (from HR departments enforcing speech codes to consultants reviewing scripts in Hollywood for representation) ([www.city-journal.org](https://www.city-journal.org/article/wokeness-the-highest-stage-of-managerialism#:~:text=The%20main%20practical%20demand%20that,Another%20example%20of%20creeping)) ([www.city-journal.org](https://www.city-journal.org/article/wokeness-the-highest-stage-of-managerialism#:~:text=equity%20consultants%20to%20ensure%20that,a%20class%20of%20moral%20managers)). In other words, woke ideology increases the power of *“managers”* in the broad sense – those who regulate others’ behavior – by insisting that only constant oversight can root out ever-present bias.

**Perspectives and Critiques:**  Woke ideology has been praised as a long-needed awakening to injustice, but it has also been heavily criticized on numerous grounds. One common critique is that it is *overzealous and performative* rather than genuinely principled. Paul Graham defines wokeness as *“an aggressively performative focus on social justice”* ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=term%20and%20wokeness%20by%20people,both%20have%20the%20same%20definition)) – in his view, the problem is not the concern for social justice per se, but the shallow and punitive way it is often expressed ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=real%20problem%20%E2%80%94%20the%20performativeness%2C,words%20to%20talk%20about%20them)). He and others liken today’s woke enforcers to moral puritans of earlier eras, a new breed of **“prigs”** who derive status by loudly condemning others’ transgressions ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=important%20clue%3A%20it%20shows%20that,answer%20that%20we%20have%20to)) ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=term%20and%20wokeness%20by%20people,both%20have%20the%20same%20definition)). Every society, Graham notes, has its priggish moralists; *“all that changes is the rules they enforce”*. In Victorian times it was sexual prudery, in Stalin’s USSR it was communist orthodoxy – *“for the woke, it’s social justice”* ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=There%27s%20a%20certain%20kind%20of,answer%20that%20we%20have%20to)) ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=rules,ask%20is%20not%20why%20people)). This view sees wokeism as a sort of secular religion or purity cult, complete with blasphemy (using the wrong word) and heresy (expressing unorthodox opinions) ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=,the%20woke%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20social%20justice)) ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=15,it%20as%20we%20treat%20religion)). The analogy to religion comes up frequently: proponents of wokeness display strong conviction, a clear sense of good vs. evil, and often demand public repentance or “struggle sessions” for sinners. Critics argue that like a fundamentalist faith, woke ideology does not tolerate dissent – *“disagreement is recast as trauma…speech is violence,”* as journalist Bari Weiss puts it ([johnhcochrane.blogspot.com](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/07/woke-week.html#:~:text=,Excellence%20with%20equity)) ([johnhcochrane.blogspot.com](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/07/woke-week.html#:~:text=,at%20all%E2%80%94but%20in%20fact%20justice)). Instead of debate, there is de-platforming; instead of forgiveness, ostracism ([johnhcochrane.blogspot.com](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/07/woke-week.html#:~:text=,is%20replaced%20with%20mob%20rule)) ([johnhcochrane.blogspot.com](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/07/woke-week.html#:~:text=,repetition%20is%20a%20great%20tool)). In this way, detractors say, the woke movement undermines classical liberal values such as free inquiry and individual rights, replacing them with an absolutist moral order. They point to examples like speakers being disinvited, employees fired for moderately expressed views, or students policing each other’s language, as evidence that wokeness breeds intolerance in the name of tolerance ([johnhcochrane.blogspot.com](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/07/woke-week.html#:~:text=views%20and%20procedural%20niceties)) ([johnhcochrane.blogspot.com](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/07/woke-week.html#:~:text=And%20the%20goal%20of%20the,line%20and%20you%20are%20next)).

Another criticism is that woke ideology relies on **ever-shifting, arcane rules** and jargon that provide an easy substitute for actual virtue ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=morality%20turned%20out%20to%20be,created%20land%20mines%20for%20the)) ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=The%20danger%20of%20these%20rules,seem%20more%20virtuous%20than%20other)). Mastering the correct terminology and stances can become a form of elite cultural capital, a way to signal one’s status as morally enlightened without necessarily doing anything concrete to help others ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=The%20danger%20of%20these%20rules,seem%20more%20virtuous%20than%20other)) ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=real%20problem%20%E2%80%94%20the%20performativeness%2C,words%20to%20talk%20about%20them)). This has led some observers to cynically suggest that wokeness is more about *performing goodness* than achieving it. Steve Stewart-Williams summarizes this dynamic: *“Instead of quietly helping members of marginalized groups, the politically correct [now woke] focused on getting people in trouble for using the wrong words”* ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=real%20problem%20%E2%80%94%20the%20performativeness%2C,words%20to%20talk%20about%20them)). In effect, it channels energy into language-policing and symbolic battles. The list of what counts as offensive or acceptable can also appear inconsistent or arbitrary to outsiders – e.g. why one outdated term is an unforgivable slur while another, with nearly identical meaning, is fine ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=morality%20turned%20out%20to%20be,created%20land%20mines%20for%20the)). Critics say this suggests a lack of clear principle beyond enforcing group orthodoxy.

**Hypocrisy and Elite Interests:** Some social analysts contend that woke ideology’s rise has less to do with mass moral awakening than with struggles within the elite class. Sociologist Musa al-Gharbi argues that *“wokeness has become a key source of cultural capital among contemporary elites”*, especially those in fields like academia, media, and tech ([www.frontporchrepublic.com](https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2024/10/the-cultural-contradictions-of-a-new-elite-a-review-of-musa-al-gharbis-we-have-never-been-woke/#:~:text=have%20a%20great%20deal%20to,benefits%2C%20and%20privileges%20thereunto%20pertaining)). In this view, publicly embracing woke positions is a way for educated strivers to gain status and advancement. Al-Gharbi observes that periods of intense woke activism (he calls them *Great Awokenings*) often coincide with **“elite overproduction”** – i.e. too many highly educated people chasing a limited number of top jobs ([www.frontporchrepublic.com](https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2024/10/the-cultural-contradictions-of-a-new-elite-a-review-of-musa-al-gharbis-we-have-never-been-woke/#:~:text=1910%E2%80%99s%2C%20the%20United%20States%20has,Great%20Awokenings%20in%20general%20and)). Under those pressures, competitors may try to out-radicalize each other in displays of ideological purity, effectively using *“concern for the less fortunate as a righteous stepping stone to glory and wealth”* ([www.frontporchrepublic.com](https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2024/10/the-cultural-contradictions-of-a-new-elite-a-review-of-musa-al-gharbis-we-have-never-been-woke/#:~:text=deserve%20high%20status%20and%20high,increase%2C%20as%20our%20elite%20aspirants)). This perspective portrays certain woke crusades as cynical or self-serving. For example, universities creating many new graduates in “grievance studies” (identity-focused fields) end up with more aspiring experts than positions; the result is a pressure to create new diversity offices and initiatives to employ this surplus – reinforcing the cycle of ideological radicalization on campus ([www.frontporchrepublic.com](https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2024/10/the-cultural-contradictions-of-a-new-elite-a-review-of-musa-al-gharbis-we-have-never-been-woke/#:~:text=persons%20to%20ally%20with%20the,stone%20to%20glory%20and%20wealth)) ([www.frontporchrepublic.com](https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2024/10/the-cultural-contradictions-of-a-new-elite-a-review-of-musa-al-gharbis-we-have-never-been-woke/#:~:text=One%20can%20only%20admire%20al,offering%20any%20theses%20as%20to)). Moreover, al-Gharbi highlights an apparent **gap between elite rhetoric and personal behavior**. Many elite adherents of woke ideology espouse anti-racist or feminist values in public, but their private actions often don’t match (e.g. wealthy progressives championing school integration or defunding police while living in mostly white safe neighborhoods, or professing LGBT allyship while largely leading conventional family lives) ([www.frontporchrepublic.com](https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2024/10/the-cultural-contradictions-of-a-new-elite-a-review-of-musa-al-gharbis-we-have-never-been-woke/#:~:text=By%20the%20end%20of%20the,as%20something%20other%20than%20heterosexual)) ([www.frontporchrepublic.com](https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2024/10/the-cultural-contradictions-of-a-new-elite-a-review-of-musa-al-gharbis-we-have-never-been-woke/#:~:text=something%20other%20than%20heterosexual)). This hypocrisy, he suggests, indicates that woke ideals are often a *positional good* – a fashion for status – more than a sincere sacrifice. The net effect, according to this analysis, is that woke ideology serves to mask and even justify the power of a “new elite” rather than truly empower the oppressed. It creates an insider language and set of credentials (knowing the correct concepts, having the right moral posture) that help gatekeep institutions, determining *“who gets to enter or remain in the cultural aristocracy”* ([www.frontporchrepublic.com](https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2024/10/the-cultural-contradictions-of-a-new-elite-a-review-of-musa-al-gharbis-we-have-never-been-woke/#:~:text=have%20a%20great%20deal%20to,benefits%2C%20and%20privileges%20thereunto%20pertaining)). In short, being fluent in wokeness is a requirement for membership in elite circles, which rewards the practitioners but does not necessarily redistribute real power or resources to marginalized communities.

**Explanations of Wokeness – Power vs. Principle:** There is debate even among critics about what fundamentally drives woke ideology. Some on the political right maintain that *wokeness is essentially Marxism updated*: a **“cultural Marxism”** that swaps economic class for identity groups in its oppressor-oppressed framework ([www.theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/09/woke-ideology-history-origins-flaws/675454/#:~:text=Right,patriotic%20versions%20of%20American%20history)) ([mises.org](https://mises.org/power-market/history-and-metaphysics-woke#:~:text=I%20believe%20Paul%20Gottfried%E2%80%94paleoconservative%20political,values%20because%20they%20are%20destructive)). They argue it’s a nihilistic worldview aimed at upending Western institutions – tearing down anything seen as predominantly “white,” “male,” “heterosexual,” etc., without a clear positive vision of what comes next ([mises.org](https://mises.org/power-market/history-and-metaphysics-woke#:~:text=Americanized%20version%20of%20the%20Frankfurt,values%20because%20they%20are%20destructive)) ([mises.org](https://mises.org/power-market/history-and-metaphysics-woke#:~:text=it%20has%2C%20but%20what%20it,heteronormative%2C%20not%20gender%20binary%2C%20etc)). Others emphasize the sincere idealism of many woke adherents, seeing it as misguided utopianism or extreme egalitarianism. Psychologist Nick Haslam, for instance, describes trends like **“concept creep,”** where definitions of harm and prejudice keep expanding, causing well-meaning people to detect more and more subtle “violence” or bias in everyday life ([johnhcochrane.blogspot.com](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/07/woke-week.html#:~:text=,cannot%20dismantle%20the%20master%E2%80%99s%20house)) ([johnhcochrane.blogspot.com](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/07/woke-week.html#:~:text=,at%20all%E2%80%94but%20in%20fact%20justice)). This could be driven by genuine compassion *and* a lowering threshold for what is considered intolerable. Still other critics point to psychological needs: “wokeism” offers a sense of moral clarity and belonging, fulfilling quasi-religious yearnings in an increasingly secular society. Its adherents often experience a powerful *meaning* in fighting what they view as righteous battles (a feeling of being on the “right side of history”).

A particularly provocative thesis comes from scholar **Nathan Cofnas**, who argues that woke ideology is the logical outcome of a widely-held (but, in his view, flawed) belief he calls *the equality thesis* ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/why-we-need-to-talk-about-the-rights?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=To%20explain%20the%20appeal%20of,conservatives%20fail%20to%20recognize%20the)) ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/a-guide-for-the-hereditarian-revolution?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=Any%20realistic%20path%20to%20victory,attracted%20to%20the%20woke%20left)). The equality thesis is the assumption that all groups of people are inherently identical in talents and temperament; thus, any disparity in outcomes is proof of discrimination. Cofnas notes that both mainstream liberals and conservatives publicly subscribe to this premise (i.e. that race or sex will not contribute to any differences in achievement if society were fair) ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/why-we-need-to-talk-about-the-rights?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=background%20of%20Christian%20morality,offers%20a%20more%20intellectually%20coherent)). Woke ideologues, he argues, are simply those who **follow this “Big Lie” to its logical conclusion**: if all groups are equal in potential, then unequal results *must* mean oppression is ongoing, and society must be radically restructured to eliminate it ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/why-we-need-to-talk-about-the-rights?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=have%20to%20explain%20what%20wokism,Smart%20people%20are%20disproportionately%20attracted)) ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/a-guide-for-the-hereditarian-revolution?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=Any%20realistic%20path%20to%20victory,attracted%20to%20the%20woke%20left)). In his words, *“wokism is what follows from taking the equality thesis seriously, given a background of Christian morality”* that emphasizes caring for the oppressed ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/why-we-need-to-talk-about-the-rights?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=To%20explain%20the%20appeal%20of,conservatives%20fail%20to%20recognize%20the)). This would explain why smart, idealistic people are often drawn to woke ideas – because within the framework of those (questionable) assumptions, woke ideology is **internally coherent** and even morally imperative ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/why-we-need-to-talk-about-the-rights?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=for%20example%2C%20mathematical%20achievement%20to,the%20persistence%20of%20racial%20disparities)). Cofnas’s solution (controversial in itself) is that only by openly challenging the equality thesis – acknowledging that different outcomes may partly reflect natural differences or varied preferences – can we remove the moral force behind woke activism ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/why-we-need-to-talk-about-the-rights?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=equality%20thesis%2C%20and%20that%20is,what%20must%20be%20explained)) ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/a-guide-for-the-hereditarian-revolution?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=practice%2C%20that%20means%20differences%20in,reason%20to%20join%20the%20right)). Until then, he suggests, any victory against woke policies will be temporary, because the root belief driving them remains intact. This perspective intersects with others that note how post-1960s Western societies developed a deep aversion to any hint of biological or innate group differences (for very understandable historical reasons), and thus became *intellectually disarmed* against arguments that all disparities are proof of injustice ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/a-guide-for-the-hereditarian-revolution?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=Only%20Hereditarianism%20Stops%20the%20Cycle,of%20Wokism)) ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/a-guide-for-the-hereditarian-revolution?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=theory%20because%20the%20elites%20who,%E2%80%9D)). In Cofnas’s view, the woke revolution is less a conspiracy or power grab than a **moral force born from a false premise** – a force that will continually resurge unless that premise is corrected.

On the other hand, writers like **Richard Hanania** focus on structural incentives: he contends that much of modern wokeness was set in motion by changes in law and bureaucracy during the Civil Rights era. Hanania argues that expansive civil rights and anti-discrimination laws after the 1960s created an environment where institutions had to proactively prove they weren’t discriminating (to avoid lawsuits and sanctions), which over decades led to pervasive identity-based policies and a *de facto* requirement to embrace woke ideas ([acxreader.github.io](https://acxreader.github.io/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-the-cf9#:~:text=,would%20of%20course%20be%20massively)). In a pithy summary, *“if you’re going to have a one sentence explanation of how society became woke, ‘It was civil rights law’ would be the closest thing to the truth”* ([acxreader.github.io](https://acxreader.github.io/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-the-cf9#:~:text=as%20it%20was%20not%20meant,world%20legible%2C%20this%20is%20it)). While he acknowledges that cultural attitudes (like guilt over racism) primed this development ([acxreader.github.io](https://acxreader.github.io/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-the-cf9#:~:text=,same%20template%20got%20applied%20to)), his thesis is that *bureaucratic momentum* took over: anti-bias regulations, diversity mandates in workplaces and schools, and the threat of legal action against any policy yielding disparate outcomes all pressured organizations to adopt the rhetoric and practices of wokeness. Essentially, once the U.S. made discrimination illegal, institutions steadily reinterpreted what *“discrimination”* meant – extending it to things like neutral tests or behavioral standards if they didn’t produce equal group outcomes, and thus enforcing ever more aggressive equity measures ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/why-we-need-to-talk-about-the-rights?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20popular%20theories,was%20widespread%20acceptance%20of%20the)) ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/a-guide-for-the-hereditarian-revolution?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=Hanania%20argues%20that%20,for%20interpreting%20and%20implementing%20the)). This legal-institutional angle dovetails with the idea of wokeness as a *“self-perpetuating bureaucracy”*: once a diversity committee or bias review board is established, it has an incentive to find problems to justify its existence ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=,proving%20their%20commitment%20to%20wokeness)). In practice, as Hanania and others note, major corporations and universities often go **beyond** what the law strictly requires – demonstrating a kind of zeal to satisfy the spirit of wokeness, if not its letter ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/a-guide-for-the-hereditarian-revolution?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=I%20agree%20with%20Hanania%20that,Suppose%20we%20eliminated%20civil)). The result is a cultural shift where even absent external mandates, many elite institutions are *“far woker than they are required to be”* because of internal pressure and values held by staff ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/a-guide-for-the-hereditarian-revolution?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=I%20agree%20with%20Hanania%20that,Suppose%20we%20eliminated%20civil)).

**Peak Woke and Backlash:** Around 2020, during the protests after George Floyd’s murder, woke ideology reached a zenith of influence and visibility – what some call *“Peak Woke.”* Public support for movements like Black Lives Matter hit record highs; corporations and sports leagues adopted social-justice slogans; academia and media underwent rapid shifts to align with woke sensibilities. This moment was seen by sympathizers as a great awakening of conscience, and by critics as an outbreak of moral hysteria. Interestingly, even many who champion some social justice causes noted the *fervor* of 2020 was extraordinary. Researchers tracking cultural trends indeed found that by various metrics (social media activity, protest frequency, vocabulary in news, etc.), the peak of wokeness was likely in 2020–2021 ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=say%20that%E2%80%A6%20,peaked%20in%202020%20or%202021)) ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=,peaked%20in%202020%20or%202021)). After that, fatigue and backlash set in. Polls began to show rising numbers of Americans uncomfortable with “cancel culture” and skeptical of some woke positions. High-profile backlashes – such as the political repudiation of certain progressive prosecutors, or parents mobilizing against perceived ideological overreach in schools – indicated a reaction against aspects of the woke program. By 2023, some commentators (even liberal ones) were writing that *“Wokeness is in retreat.”* Steve Stewart-Williams observes that the **excesses of the 2020 peak prompted many to say “enough is enough,” leading to a modest swing back towards moderation** ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=now%20once%20again%20receding)). He and others liken the pattern to earlier moral panics that eventually burn out. Comedian and pundit ridiculing of woke absurdities – much as satire helped puncture 1990s political correctness ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=10,because%20people%20started%20ridiculing%20it)) – has also undermined the mystique of woke authority.

That said, *woke ideology has by no means disappeared*. It has been “normalized” within many institutions, and its core ideas (systemic racism, white privilege, gender fluidity as identity, etc.) continue to influence mainstream discussions and policies. However, the momentum of the Great Awokening has slowed. The cutting-edge intellectual energy on the left has moved somewhat from endless expansion of identity critique (*Woke 1.0*) toward debates about economic inequality, free speech, or even critiques of wokeness itself by leftists who worry it became counterproductive. Noah Smith, for instance, argues that wokeness, while arising for valid reasons, started losing its dynamism once it turned into an enforced institutional orthodoxy; he notes that by the late 2010s, *“what was once a Cambrian explosion of memes and ideas [became] canonized, standardized, and institutionalized,”* leaving a prairie fire that’s burnt out at the center even if still burning at the edges ([www.noahpinion.blog](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/thoughts-on-the-origins-of-wokeness#:~:text=I%20went%20back%20and%20forth,Meanwhile%2C%20at%20the%20level%20of)) ([www.noahpinion.blog](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/thoughts-on-the-origins-of-wokeness#:~:text=clear%20that%20wokeness%20is%20still,1%20already%20starting%20to%20feel)). In youth culture, there are signs of a quiet backlash or simply a shift in priorities ([www.noahpinion.blog](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/thoughts-on-the-origins-of-wokeness#:~:text=increasingly%20likely%20to%20be%20middle,still%20flaming%20at%20the%20edges)).

**Conclusion:** In summary, *“woke” ideology is a modern form of progressive moralism* – a constellation of beliefs that sees society through a lens of pervasive power imbalances and demands vigilant action to rectify them. It champions causes of racial, gender, and sexual equality (among others) with an often uncompromising zeal. This ideology has evolved from commendable origins in civil rights and awareness-raising, into a wider – at times more rigid – social doctrine about how we should speak, think, and govern. It has achieved significant influence, reshaping institutional policies and social norms in a short span. But it has also proven polarizing. To its **advocates**, woke ideology is about empathy and justice: being “awake” to the suffering of others and the unseen injustices woven into everyday life, and refusing to tolerate those injustices. To its **critics**, it represents a dogmatic, even illiberal, mindset – one that elevates group identity over common humanity, treats dissent as heresy, and extends the reach of bureaucratic control under the banner of virtue ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=15,it%20as%20we%20treat%20religion)) ([www.city-journal.org](https://www.city-journal.org/article/wokeness-the-highest-stage-of-managerialism#:~:text=But%20if%20Burnham%20were%20alive,reappear%20today%20in%20hypertrophied%20form)). Understanding woke ideology requires grappling with both these interpretations, as well as the social conditions that gave it life. Far from arising in a vacuum, wokeness is the product of historical currents – the legacy of oppression and the striving for equality – but also of contemporary forces like academia, law, the internet, and elite competition. Whether one views it as a righteous revolution or a moral panic (or something in between), *“woke” ideology now occupies a significant place in the cultural landscape*, and debates over its merits and excesses look set to continue for years to come.

1. **Steve Stewart-Williams – “Where Did Wokeness Come From?” (2025).** Stewart-Williams summarizes Paul Graham’s thesis that woke ideology is essentially *political correctness reborn*: a moral purity movement fixated on social justice as its creed ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=term%20and%20wokeness%20by%20people,both%20have%20the%20same%20definition)). He traces its origin to 1980s academia and notes how it faded in the late 1990s before surging back in the 2010s (the *“Great Awokening”*) via social media outrage ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=11,Yglesias%20dubbed%20the%20Great%20Awokening)). Stewart-Williams (echoing Graham) describes wokeness as *“political correctness on steroids,”* lacking consistent principles and enforced by a new class of bureaucratic “commissars” in institutions ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=13,driven%20and%20enforced%20by%20professionals)). He argues that wokeness peaked around 2020 and is now receding, suggesting we treat it like a religion – tolerated in personal belief but not imposed in workplaces or schools ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=15,it%20as%20we%20treat%20religion)). *(URL: stevestewartwilliams.com)*

2. **Aporia Magazine – “Woke as Managerial Ideology.”** This source (e.g. articles by Malcom Kyeyune or others in *Aporia*) posits that wokeness functions as the *ideology of the modern managerial elite*. It argues that well-educated progressives use woke ideals to solidify institutional power and justify expanding bureaucracy ([www.city-journal.org](https://www.city-journal.org/article/wokeness-the-highest-stage-of-managerialism#:~:text=But%20if%20Burnham%20were%20alive,reappear%20today%20in%20hypertrophied%20form)). The perspective builds on James Burnham’s concept of a “managerial revolution,” suggesting wokeness has become a *“systematized, managerial ideology”* that new elites use to claim moral authority to govern ([www.city-journal.org](https://www.city-journal.org/article/wokeness-the-highest-stage-of-managerialism#:~:text=The%20core%20thesis%20of%20James,regardless%20of%20formal%20ownership%20status)) ([www.city-journal.org](https://www.city-journal.org/article/wokeness-the-highest-stage-of-managerialism#:~:text=But%20if%20Burnham%20were%20alive,reappear%20today%20in%20hypertrophied%20form)). For example, demands for diversity mandates or speech codes increase the role of administrators and consultants (a *“Woke Industrial Complex”*). In Aporia/City Journal essays, the authors highlight that in the U.S., capital and corporations have embraced woke causes more than in other countries, indicating it’s not simply a grassroots leftist movement but one intertwined with corporate and professional class interests ([www.city-journal.org](https://www.city-journal.org/article/wokeness-the-highest-stage-of-managerialism#:~:text=Why%20is%20it%2C%20then%2C%20that,sings%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Internationale%E2%80%9D%20at%20its)) ([www.city-journal.org](https://www.city-journal.org/article/wokeness-the-highest-stage-of-managerialism#:~:text=afflicting%20the%20U,%E2%80%9CThe%20Internationale%E2%80%9D%20at%20its%20congresses)). *(URL: aporiamagazine.com)*

3. **Gray Mirror (Curtis Yarvin) – “The Origin of Woke: A George Mason Perspective.”** This piece (as indicated by the title on Graymirror.substack) explores how woke ideology arose from intellectual currents and policy shifts, possibly drawing on arguments similar to Richard Hanania’s. It likely emphasizes the *U.S. policy environment* (e.g. civil rights laws, regulatory decisions) and academia (e.g. George Mason University scholars’ views) in seeding today’s woke norms. For instance, one referenced argument is that *civil rights law entrenched identity-based preferences*, so that by the 2010s culture was catching up to legal mandates ([acxreader.github.io](https://acxreader.github.io/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-the-cf9#:~:text=,would%20of%20course%20be%20massively)). Gray Mirror’s author may frame wokeness as not merely spontaneous cultural upheaval but the result of decades of elite planning, bureaucracy, and ideology (“ideas nurtured in the professor’s study” taking power). In sum, this source presents woke ideology as having *strategic origins in the marriage of activist ideas with government/institutional power*. *(URL: graymirror.substack.com)*

4. **Musa al-Gharbi – “The Cultural Contradictions of a New Elite” (2023/2024).** Al-Gharbi, a sociologist at Columbia University, analyzes woke ideology as a phenomenon driven by *elite status competition*. In his book *We Have Never Been Woke* (and related essays), he argues that professions with surplus graduates (symbolic analysts in academia, media, etc.) use woke causes as a means to advance themselves ([www.frontporchrepublic.com](https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2024/10/the-cultural-contradictions-of-a-new-elite-a-review-of-musa-al-gharbis-we-have-never-been-woke/#:~:text=1910%E2%80%99s%2C%20the%20United%20States%20has,Great%20Awokenings%20in%20general%20and)). Wokeness, he says, has become a form of *cultural capital* for educated elites – fluency in woke rhetoric confers prestige and gatekeeping power ([www.frontporchrepublic.com](https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2024/10/the-cultural-contradictions-of-a-new-elite-a-review-of-musa-al-gharbis-we-have-never-been-woke/#:~:text=have%20a%20great%20deal%20to,benefits%2C%20and%20privileges%20thereunto%20pertaining)). He documents how waves of intense woke activism (*“Great Awokenings”*) coincided with *“elite overproduction,”* leading ambitious aspirants to champion radical causes publicly while often privately maintaining their privileges ([www.frontporchrepublic.com](https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2024/10/the-cultural-contradictions-of-a-new-elite-a-review-of-musa-al-gharbis-we-have-never-been-woke/#:~:text=1910%E2%80%99s%2C%20the%20United%20States%20has,Great%20Awokenings%20in%20general%20and)) ([www.frontporchrepublic.com](https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2024/10/the-cultural-contradictions-of-a-new-elite-a-review-of-musa-al-gharbis-we-have-never-been-woke/#:~:text=persons%20to%20ally%20with%20the,stone%20to%20glory%20and%20wealth)). Al-Gharbi highlights the **hypocrisy** of many elite adherents, noting a gap between their woke pronouncements and personal actions (e.g. firms preaching diversity but still largely favoring insiders) ([www.frontporchrepublic.com](https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2024/10/the-cultural-contradictions-of-a-new-elite-a-review-of-musa-al-gharbis-we-have-never-been-woke/#:~:text=account%20does%20not%20require%20our,the%20benefit%20of%20others%2C%20even)) ([www.frontporchrepublic.com](https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2024/10/the-cultural-contradictions-of-a-new-elite-a-review-of-musa-al-gharbis-we-have-never-been-woke/#:~:text=By%20the%20end%20of%20the,as%20something%20other%20than%20heterosexual)). His view is that woke ideology’s *contradictions* (high ideals versus self-interest) reveal it to be less a mass moral awakening than a reshuffling of elite hierarchies. *(URL: musaalgharbi.substack.com)*

5. **“From Poverty to Progress” Substack – “Trends That Created the Woke.”** This source identifies long-term social trends underpinning the rise of woke ideology. It likely points to factors such as: the significant reduction of material poverty and overt bigotry in modern society (paradoxically making subtler grievances more salient), the expansion of higher education (exposing more people to activist academic theories), the influence of the internet and social media in spreading new values, and generational shifts in attitudes. For example, it might note how **social media outrage dynamics** and youth activism culture in the 2010s accelerated woke movements ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=,seemed%20to%20like%20being%20outraged)). It may also discuss demographic and value changes (e.g. more diverse, socially liberal younger generations) that made society more receptive to woke ideas. In summary, this author frames wokeness as emerging from *progress-induced problems*: as societies become wealthier and more equal, cultural and identity issues move to the forefront (*“post-material”* issues), and new forms of activism gain momentum. *(URL: frompovertytoprogress.substack.com)*

6. **Nathan Cofnas – “Why We Need to Talk About the Right’s Stupidity Problem” (2024).** Philosopher Nathan Cofnas in this essay contends that the *“big lie” motivating wokism is the equality dogma* – the assumption that groups do not differ innately in traits like intelligence ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/why-we-need-to-talk-about-the-rights?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=To%20explain%20the%20appeal%20of,conservatives%20fail%20to%20recognize%20the)) ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/why-we-need-to-talk-about-the-rights?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=have%20to%20explain%20what%20wokism,Smart%20people%20are%20disproportionately%20attracted)). He argues that elites (left and right) have broadly accepted this **blank-slate egalitarianism**, and woke activists are the ones taking it to its logical end: if all groups are inherently equal, any disparity is proof of oppression, thus justifying perpetual affirmative action, diversity policies, and accusations of systemic bias ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/why-we-need-to-talk-about-the-rights?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=background%20of%20Christian%20morality,offers%20a%20more%20intellectually%20coherent)) ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/why-we-need-to-talk-about-the-rights?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=for%20example%2C%20mathematical%20achievement%20to,the%20persistence%20of%20racial%20disparities)). Cofnas provocatively asserts that conservatives lose ground because they too publicly pretend to believe the equality thesis, making woke arguments appear *more intellectually consistent* in explaining disparities ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/why-we-need-to-talk-about-the-rights?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=for%20example%2C%20mathematical%20achievement%20to,the%20persistence%20of%20racial%20disparities)). To undercut woke ideology, he suggests the right must openly challenge this thesis by discussing human biodiversity and group differences – essentially starting a *“hereditarian”* conversation that is currently taboo ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/why-we-need-to-talk-about-the-rights?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=equality%20thesis%2C%20and%20that%20is,what%20must%20be%20explained)). This, he believes, would remove the moral impetus from woke claims and help win back smart, truth-oriented people to non-woke views. *(URL: ncofnas.com)*

7. **Paul Graham – “The Origins of Wokeness” (Jan 2025).** In this essay, technologist Paul Graham provides a historical and psychological account of woke ideology. He characterizes *wokeness as a successor to the 1980s–90s political correctness movement*, describing it as *“an aggressively performative focus on social justice”* ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=term%20and%20wokeness%20by%20people,both%20have%20the%20same%20definition)). Graham emphasizes the continuity of human *“prigs”* – individuals drawn to strict moral crusades – and notes that wokeness is simply the latest content for that temperament ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=important%20clue%3A%20it%20shows%20that,answer%20that%20we%20have%20to)) ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=rules,ask%20is%20not%20why%20people)). He traces modern wokeness to academic radicalism: student activists of the ’60s who entered universities, creating a wave of P.C. norms by the late ’80s ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=issues.%20,retire%2C%20they%20gradually%20became%20both)) ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=But%20in%20the%20early%201970s,2)). His essay outlines key features of woke ideology: lack of clear principles (relying on ever-changing rules) ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=morality%20turned%20out%20to%20be,created%20land%20mines%20for%20the)), a shift from *protest to punishment* (using institutional power to enforce beliefs) ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#:~:text=A%20new%20set%20of%20moral,as%20a%20comment%20on%20current)), and the role of *social media outrage* and polarized media in supercharging the movement in the 2010s ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=11,Yglesias%20dubbed%20the%20Great%20Awokening)) ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=12,increasing%20polarization%20of%20the%20media)). Graham ultimately argues wokeness behaved like a wave of religious revivalism, peaking around 2020 and now ebbing ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=,peaked%20in%202020%20or%202021)). He suggests society should treat it akin to religion: allow freedom of belief but keep its dictates out of official policy and prevent it from curtailing open discourse ([www.stevestewartwilliams.com](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from?action=share&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=substack#:~:text=15,it%20as%20we%20treat%20religion)). *(URL: paulgraham.com)*

8. **Nathan Cofnas – “A Guide for the Hereditarian Revolution” (2024).** In this follow-up piece, Cofnas lays out how embracing scientific findings on genetic differences could *“derail the woke juggernaut.”* He reiterates that without addressing the root assumption of innate group equality, efforts against woke policies will be futile, as the narrative of oppression will keep regenerating ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/a-guide-for-the-hereditarian-revolution?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=Any%20realistic%20path%20to%20victory,attracted%20to%20the%20woke%20left)) ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/a-guide-for-the-hereditarian-revolution?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=because%20the%20mainstream%20right%20accepts,reason%20to%20join%20the%20right)). Cofnas advocates for a *“hereditarian revolution”* – persuading intellectual elites to accept **race realism** (the idea of biologically rooted group differences) as a basis for understanding outcome disparities ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/a-guide-for-the-hereditarian-revolution?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=Any%20realistic%20path%20to%20victory,attracted%20to%20the%20woke%20left)) ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/a-guide-for-the-hereditarian-revolution?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=The%20prospect%20of%20a%20hereditarian,can%20construct%20a%20better%20world)). He argues this is both feasible and necessary: once elites privately acknowledge differences in ability distribution, the moral urgency behind equity mandates and diversity initiatives will lessen, breaking what he sees as a cycle of escalating woke demands ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/a-guide-for-the-hereditarian-revolution?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=because%20the%20mainstream%20right%20accepts,reason%20to%20join%20the%20right)) ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/a-guide-for-the-hereditarian-revolution?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=Only%20Hereditarianism%20Stops%20the%20Cycle,of%20Wokism)). The guide discusses practical steps like promoting open science and protecting researchers who study human genetics, as well as challenging misinterpretations of civil rights law that assume equal performance across groups ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/a-guide-for-the-hereditarian-revolution?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=Hanania%20argues%20that%20,for%20interpreting%20and%20implementing%20the)) ([ncofnas.com](https://ncofnas.com/p/a-guide-for-the-hereditarian-revolution?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=long%20as%20the%20elites%20who,back%20to%20where%20we%20started)). Cofnas’s perspective is a **dissenting one** – even many anti-woke thinkers shy from his solution – but it underscores a crucial point: woke ideology is underpinned by empirical claims (or denials thereof), so the cultural battle is entwined with debates about human nature. *(URL: ncofnas.com)*
