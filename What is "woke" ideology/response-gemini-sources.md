Based on the provided sources, "woke" ideology is a term used by its critics to describe a contemporary political and moral belief system primarily concerned with identity, power dynamics, and social justice [1, 7]. Originating in African-American Vernacular English as an exhortation to be aware of systemic racial injustice, the term has evolved to describe what these authors see as a more comprehensive and rigid ideology [11].

### Core Tenets

The sources describe the core tenets of "woke" ideology as follows:

*   **Group Identity and Power Dynamics**: The ideology views society primarily as a collection of identity groups (based on race, gender, sexuality, etc.) engaged in a struggle for power [1, 2]. Society is analyzed through a lens of "oppressor" and "oppressed" groups, with an emphasis on dismantling perceived systems of oppression like patriarchy and white supremacy [1]. This is sometimes referred to as an "oppression matrix" where various identities intersect [1].
*   **Rejection of Universalism and Objectivity**: Proponents are said to reject Enlightenment values like universalism, individualism, and objective truth [1]. Instead, they prioritize "lived experience" and "ways of knowing" that are specific to particular identity groups. Objective truth and reason are often framed as tools of the dominant group used to maintain power [1].
*   **Successor Ideology**: Several sources characterize "woke" ideology as a successor to, or replacement for, traditional belief systems like Christianity and classical liberalism [7, 9]. Paul Graham describes it as a powerful new "moral fashion" that functions like a religion, complete with its own heresies and methods for punishing dissenters [7]. Others see it as a secularized version of American Protestantism or Puritanism, exhibiting a similar moral fervor, public confession, and zeal for purity [3, 9]. However, some critics of this view argue it is not a Christian heresy but a distinct, anti-Christian ideology [10].

### Origins and Development

The sources offer several overlapping theories for the emergence of this ideology:

*   **Philosophical Roots**: Steve Stewart-Williams traces the ideology's intellectual lineage to postmodernism and Critical Theory. From postmodernism, it borrows skepticism toward objective truth and a focus on how language constructs reality and power. From Critical Theory, it takes the goal of actively critiquing and dismantling societal structures to achieve liberation [1].
*   **The "Great Awokening"**: Sociologist Musa al-Gharbi identifies a phenomenon he calls the "Great Awokening," a sudden and dramatic shift in the attitudes of white liberals and Democrats on issues of race, gender, and identity that began around 2014 [4]. This shift, he argues, was not a gradual evolution but a rapid ideological transformation that created a new, powerful political bloc [4].
*   **Socio-Economic and Technological Factors**: Several authors point to wider trends that created fertile ground for the ideology. Paul Graham argues that the internet and social media unleashed a "genie" of moral fashion, allowing new, often intolerant, moral ideas to spread rapidly and enforce conformity [7]. The author of *From Poverty to Progress* suggests that factors like increased education, rising prosperity (which allows for a focus on post-material concerns), declining religiosity, and a more diverse media landscape all contributed to its rise [5].
*   **A "Managerial Ideology"**: The magazine *Aporia* frames "woke" as a "managerial ideology" that serves the interests of the professional-managerial class (academics, HR professionals, journalists, NGO employees). In this view, the ideology's complex language and moral imperatives act as a justification for the power and expansion of this class, allowing it to control other institutions and social strata [2]. Curtis Yarvin (writing in *Gray Mirror*) presents a similar idea, arguing that the ideology functions as the informal "state religion" of the modern administrative state and its associated institutions, like universities and the media [3].

In summary, the provided sources define "woke" ideology not simply as an awareness of social injustice, but as a comprehensive and doctrinaire belief system that emerged from a confluence of academic theories, socio-technological changes, and historical religious impulses. Its critics argue that it has become a new public orthodoxy that suppresses dissent and rejects core principles of liberalism and the Enlightenment [1, 6, 7].
