Based on the provided sources, "woke" ideology is a political and social belief system primarily concerned with identifying and challenging perceived power structures and systemic injustices related to group identity [1, 2, 7]. While the term "woke" originated in African American Vernacular English as an exhortation to be "awake" to racial prejudice and discrimination, the sources describe its modern usage as representing a broader ideology with distinct tenets, origins, and functions [11].

### Core Tenets

According to the sources, the ideology is characterized by the following beliefs:

*   **Group Identity and Power Dynamics**: A central tenet is the view that society is a battleground of power struggles between oppressor and oppressed groups, defined by identities like race, gender, and sexuality. This framework, often associated with critical theory, prioritizes group identity over individualism [1, 7].
*   **Systemic Injustice**: The ideology posits that oppression is not merely the product of individual bigotry but is embedded within societal systems, institutions, and language. Disparities in outcomes between identity groups are seen as prima facie evidence of these systemic biases [2, 4, 8].
*   **Rejection of Universalism**: "Wokeness" is often described as rejecting Enlightenment values such as objective truth and universalism in favor of "standpoint epistemology," which holds that one's lived experience and group identity provide a privileged form of knowledge [1, 6]. This can lead to a view that science and reason are social constructs used to uphold dominant power structures [6].
*   **Moral and Purity Frameworks**: Several sources argue that the ideology functions like a religion, particularly a "mutation of Protestantism" or a form of Gnosticism [3, 7, 10]. It has its own concepts of sin (privilege, complicity in oppression), heresy (dissenting from its orthodoxy), and blasphemy (violating social justice norms). It offers a path to righteousness through activism and acknowledging one's privilege [1, 7].

### Origins and Driving Forces

The provided sources propose several overlapping theories for the emergence and spread of "woke" ideology:

*   **Intellectual and Religious Roots**:
    *   **Postmodernism and Critical Theory**: Steve Stewart-Williams argues that "wokeness" synthesizes postmodern concepts—such as Michel Foucault's ideas on power and knowledge—with a Protestant moral framework. It takes the critical, deconstructive impulse of postmodernism but attaches it to a rigid moral crusade [1].
    *   **Secularized Religion**: Multiple authors contend that "wokeness" fills the spiritual vacuum left by the decline of traditional religion in the West. It provides a source of meaning, community, moral certainty, and a framework for salvation [1, 7, 9]. Curtis Yarvin traces its lineage to the evolution of American mainline Protestantism, viewing it as a new "state church" [3]. Keith Woods and *Law & Liberty* argue it is a modern resurgence of Gnosticism, an ancient religion that saw the material world as corrupt and evil, created by a lesser god (the "Demiurge"), and believed that salvation came through secret knowledge (*gnosis*) held by an enlightened elite [9, 10]. In this parallel, "systemic oppression" is the Demiurge, and "wokeness" is the secret knowledge that allows the enlightened to see the world's true nature [10].
*   **Socio-Economic Drivers**:
    *   **Managerial Ideology**: The *Aporia* essay posits that "wokeness" is a "managerial ideology" used by the professional-managerial class (academics, HR professionals, journalists, NGO employees) to legitimize its power. By managing complex social-justice rules, this class creates a moral justification for its elite status and a tool to discipline the workforce and wider society [2].
    *   **Affluence and Post-Materialism**: The "From Poverty to Progress" newsletter suggests that "woke" ideology is a product of immense wealth and security. As societies solve basic material problems, their values shift to "post-materialist" concerns like self-expression and abstract social justice, which are less constrained by practical realities [5].
    *   **Status Signaling**: Technologist Paul Graham argues that "wokeness" functions as a tool for the ambitious upper class to signal their good morals and conformity. It spreads through mechanisms similar to fashion, where adopting the correct opinions at the right time demonstrates one's elite status and fitness for power [7].
*   **A Reaction to Scientific Theories**:
    *   **The "Hereditarian" Counter-Theory**: Nathan Cofnas presents the view that "woke" ideology is a powerful "moral-intellectual immune system" developed specifically to suppress "hereditarianism"—the scientific theory that group differences in social outcomes may be partially explained by genetic differences in traits like intelligence [6, 8]. According to this view, the ideology’s core tenets (e.g., that all disparities are due to systemic oppression) function to make any discussion of biological group differences a moral taboo, thereby protecting a preferred social narrative [6].

He draws parallels between the Gnostic belief in a corrupt material world and the Woke belief in all-pervasive systemic oppression, with "consciousness raising" being the modern equivalent of receiving secret knowledge (*gnosis*).
