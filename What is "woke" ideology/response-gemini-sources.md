"Woke" is a term with a dual meaning. It originated as a call for social awareness but has since been adopted by critics to describe a specific political ideology.

The term "woke" originated in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and means to be "awake" to or aware of social and racial injustice [10, 11]. Its usage can be traced back to the early 20th century, with a notable example being folk-blues singer Lead Belly’s use of the phrase "stay woke" in his 1938 song "Scottsboro Boys" as a warning for Black Americans to remain vigilant [11]. The term was repopularized and entered the mainstream with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement following the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. In this context, #StayWoke served as a digital rallying cry to remain alert to police brutality and systemic racism [12].

In contemporary political discourse, particularly among its critics, "woke" ideology refers to a specific set of beliefs and attitudes that are seen as a departure from classical liberalism. The provided sources define this ideology through several interconnected themes:

### Core Tenets as Defined by Critics

According to critics, "woke" ideology is characterized by a set of core tenets that shape its worldview:
*   **Group Identity and Power:** Society is primarily understood as a battlefield of power struggles between oppressor and oppressed groups, categorized by identities like race, gender, and sexuality [1, 2].
*   **Social Constructionism:** It holds that many human categories and knowledge itself are not objective realities but social constructs created to maintain the power of dominant groups [1].
*   **Emphasis on Equity:** It prioritizes equality of outcome ("equity") over equality of opportunity. This can involve treating people differently based on their group identity to correct for historical and systemic imbalances [1].
*   **Primacy of "Lived Experience":** The personal, subjective experience of individuals from marginalized groups is often elevated as a primary source of knowledge and evidence, sometimes over objective data [1].

### A Successor to Liberalism and a Secular Religion

Several sources frame "woke" ideology, which they sometimes call "The Successor Ideology," as a replacement for liberalism that enforces a new moral orthodoxy [6, 9]. From this perspective, it abandons liberal principles like individualism, universalism, and free speech in favor of a collectivism based on identity groups [9].

This has led some commentators to describe it as a form of secular religion [3, 9]. Curtis Yarvin, for example, traces its origins to American Puritanism, arguing it functions like a faith with its own dogma (e.g., systemic racism), original sin (privilege), heresy (dissenting opinions), and clergy (such as DEI professionals) [3].

### An Ideology of the Managerial Class

Another critical perspective posits that "wokeness" is the ideology of the professional-managerial class (PMC)—the highly educated elite who work in media, academia, NGOs, and corporate management [2, 4]. According to this view, the ideology serves the interests of this class by:
*   **Providing Moral Justification:** It allows the PMC to justify its elite status through displays of moral virtue and superior knowledge about social justice [2, 7].
*   **Managing Dissent:** It channels social discontent toward cultural issues and away from fundamental economic critiques that might threaten the PMC's own economic standing [4]. It offers a framework for managing social tensions without requiring significant wealth redistribution [2].
*   **Creating Professional Roles:** It creates and legitimizes new professional fields, such as DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion), which are staffed by and serve the interests of this class [2].

### Intellectual Roots

Commentators trace the intellectual roots of this ideology to several sources. Steve Stewart-Williams identifies a synthesis of three main influences:
1.  **Postmodernism:** Particularly its skepticism of objective truth and its focus on language and power.
2.  **Critical Theory:** Its framework for analyzing society through the lens of power structures and oppression.
3.  **Identity Politics:** The idea that identity is the primary lens through which to understand oneself and one's place in the world [1].

In summary, while "woke" began as a term for awareness of racial injustice, it is now widely used by critics to describe what they see as a distinct and illiberal ideology focused on group identity, power dynamics, and the pursuit of equal outcomes, which they argue functions as a secular religion and serves the interests of a managerial elite [2, 3, 9].
