Based on the provided sources, "woke" ideology is a contemporary political and social framework centered on identifying and opposing perceived systemic injustices related to group identity. The authors describe it not as a fringe movement but as a powerful and increasingly dominant belief system, particularly among Western elites, that functions as a successor to both traditional liberalism and religion [1, 4, 7].

### Core Tenets

The sources identify several core tenets of "woke" ideology:

1.  **Group Identity and Power Dynamics:** Society is primarily understood as a struggle between oppressor and oppressed groups, defined by identity categories such as race, gender, sexuality, and disability. This framework, often drawing from Critical Theory, categorizes individuals as either privileged or marginalized based on their group identity [1, 6].
2.  **Systemic Injustice:** Oppression is not merely the result of individual prejudice but is deeply embedded within societal structures, institutions, and language ("systemic racism," "patriarchy"). This perspective rejects the classical liberal focus on individual rights and equality of opportunity in favor of an analysis centered on group-based power imbalances and a demand for equity of outcomes [1, 6].
3.  **Social Constructionism:** Many human traits and social hierarchies are viewed as social constructs created to maintain the power of dominant groups. This includes a rejection of biological explanations for group differences in favor of cultural and environmental ones, sometimes referred to as the "blank slate" view [1, 8].
4.  **The Primacy of "Lived Experience":** The subjective experiences of individuals from marginalized groups are given special authority as a source of knowledge. This is seen as a way to validate perspectives that have been historically ignored, but critics argue it can devalue objective evidence and reason [1].
5.  **Rejection of Liberal Norms:** The ideology is often critical of core tenets of liberalism, such as free speech, due process, and viewpoint neutrality. Speech can be viewed as a form of violence ("words are violence"), and platforms or ideas deemed harmful can be legitimately censored or "deplatformed" to protect marginalized groups [1, 7]. Paul Graham notes that this creates a system with concepts equivalent to blasphemy, where questioning core tenets can lead to severe social and professional consequences [7].

### Origins and Influences

The authors trace the origins of "woke" ideology to a confluence of intellectual, social, and historical trends:

*   **Intellectual Roots:** Many sources point to 20th-century postmodernist and critical theories, particularly the work of French intellectuals like Michel Foucault, as the intellectual foundation [1]. However, other analyses trace its roots deeper into Western thought, such as the philosophical shifts of nominalism and voluntarism that prioritized will and power over reason [9], or to specific strains of American Protestantism that evolved into a secular, universalist state religion [3].
*   **The "Great Awokening":** This term describes a significant, quantifiable shift in the language and priorities of progressives, particularly white liberals, beginning around 2011-2014. This period saw a dramatic increase in the use of terms related to social justice in mainstream media and a heightened focus on race and identity issues [1, 5].
*   **Socio-Economic Factors:** Several authors argue that "woke" ideology is not an academic theory that "escaped the lab" but rather a belief system that emerged organically among elites to serve specific functions [4]. These factors include:
    *   **Secularization:** The decline of traditional religion created a spiritual vacuum, which "wokeness" fills by providing a sense of meaning, purpose, community, and a moral framework of good versus evil [1, 5, 7].
    *   **Elite Overproduction and Status Signaling:** With a surplus of educated elites competing for a limited number of high-status positions, adopting complex and often counter-intuitive "woke" beliefs became a way to signal one's elite status and moral superiority. Musa al-Gharbi terms these "luxury beliefs" [4].
    *   **Affluence and Post-Materialist Values:** As societies become wealthier, they tend to shift focus from material security to post-materialist values like self-expression and social justice, creating fertile ground for these ideas [5].

### Function and Purpose

According to the sources, the ideology serves several functions in contemporary society:

*   **A Managerial Ideology:** One analysis presents "wokeness" as a tool for the Professional-Managerial Class (PMC). It provides a moral language to manage an increasingly diverse workforce, justify the authority of HR departments and DEI consultants, and channel social discontent into manageable, intra-elite conflicts rather than class-based challenges to the economic system [2].
*   **A Successor Ideology/Religion:** It functions as a replacement for traditional belief systems. It offers a creation myth (society was built on oppression), a concept of original sin (privilege), saints (marginalized activists), heretics (those who dissent), and a path to salvation (anti-racism and activism) [1]. Curtis Yarvin describes it as the unofficial "state religion" of the modern administrative state, which he calls "the Cathedral" [3].
*   **A Moral Fashion:** Paul Graham describes it as a form of "moral fashion" that, like clothing fashion, is arbitrary, constantly changing, and driven by a small group of trendsetters. Adherence is enforced through intense social pressure, making it difficult and costly to dissent [7].
