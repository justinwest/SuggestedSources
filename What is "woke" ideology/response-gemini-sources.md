"Woke" is a term that originated in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and initially meant being alert to racial prejudice and systemic injustice [7]. Over the last decade, its meaning has expanded and become highly contested. According to the provided sources, "woke" or "wokeism" now generally refers to a left-leaning political ideology that views society primarily through the lens of power dynamics between identity groups [1].

### Core Tenets

While there is no single unified doctrine, the sources identify several core tenets commonly associated with woke ideology:

1.  **Systemic Oppression and Group Identity**: Society is understood as a matrix of oppressive systems (e.g., systemic racism, patriarchy, cis-heteronormativity) that grant privilege to dominant groups (e.g., white, male, heterosexual, cisgender) at the expense of marginalized groups [1, 4]. The primary focus is on group identity rather than the individual.
2.  **Rejection of Objective Truth**: The ideology is deeply influenced by postmodernist thought, which critiques universal truth claims. Instead, it elevates "lived experience" and "standpoint epistemology," the idea that a person's knowledge is shaped by their social position and identity. This often leads to the view that science and reason are not objective but are "constructs" of the dominant culture used to maintain power [1].
3.  **The Nature of Power**: Drawing from thinkers like Michel Foucault, this ideology sees power as pervasive, operating not just through overt force but through language, social norms, and institutions [1]. This leads to a focus on deconstructing language and discourse to uncover hidden biases and power structures.
4.  **Equity over Equality**: The goal is not "equality of opportunity" but "equity," which aims for equality of outcome. This requires actively redistributing resources and power to counteract the effects of systemic oppression, which can involve treating people differently based on their group identity [1].

### Intellectual and Historical Origins

The provided sources trace the origins of "wokeness" through several distinct stages:

*   **Intellectual Lineage**: Many authors trace a path from Marxism, which focuses on class-based oppression, to the Frankfurt School's Critical Theory, which expanded the critique to culture. This was followed by French postmodernists like Foucault and Jacques Derrida, who focused on power and deconstruction. These ideas were then adapted in American academia into Critical Race Theory (CRT) by figures like Derrick Bell and intersectionality by Kimberlé Crenshaw, forming the immediate intellectual precursors to modern wokeness [1, 9].
*   **The "Great Awokening"**: The term gained widespread use around 2014, coinciding with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and the increased use of social media for activism. This period saw a significant shift among white liberals in their stated beliefs on race and justice [5, 7].
*   **Secular Religion**: Several sources describe wokeness as a form of secular religion or a successor to American Protestantism. They point to concepts like "original sin" (privilege), "heresy" (problematic views), "blasphemy" (slurs), and public "confession" (apologies for privilege) as parallels [1, 3]. It is seen as filling a spiritual void left by declining traditional religion [5]. Keith Woods, however, argues against a common comparison to Gnosticism, stating that wokeness is fundamentally materialist and this-worldly, unlike the transcendent focus of Gnosticism [10].

### Sociological and Economic Explanations

Beyond its intellectual history, various authors propose reasons for its recent prominence:

*   **Managerial Ideology**: One theory posits that wokeness serves as a "managerial ideology" for the professional-managerial class (PMC). It allows corporations and institutions to manage an increasingly diverse workforce, justify the existence of HR and DEI departments, and channel employee discontent into non-economic grievances, thereby deflecting from issues like wages and working conditions [2, 11].
*   **Status Symbol and Fashion**: Paul Graham describes wokeness as a powerful tool for "good-people-signaling." In a secular, prosperous society, adhering to woke norms became a way for the educated elite to distinguish themselves as morally superior, much like a fashion that spreads from elite institutions outward [7].
*   **Institutional Power**: Curtis Yarvin (writing as Mencius Moldbug) argues that wokeness is the informal ideology of the modern American establishment (what he calls the "Cathedral," comprising universities, the media, and the civil service). He views it as a descendant of mainline Protestantism that functions as a state religion, enforcing conformity through institutional and social power [3].
*   **Economic Prosperity and Education**: Another perspective suggests that the rise of wokeness was enabled by unprecedented peace, prosperity, and mass education. As basic material needs were met for more people, their focus shifted to post-materialist concerns like self-actualization and social justice, creating fertile ground for these ideas to flourish [5].

### Critical Perspectives

The provided sources are themselves critical analyses of the ideology:

*   **Denial of Biology**: Nathan Cofnas argues that the central tenet of wokeism is the "denial of human nature," specifically the rejection of any role for genetics in explaining group differences in social outcomes. He contends that this "blank slate" view is scientifically false and that the right's failure to effectively challenge it is a major strategic error [6, 8].
*   **Contradictions of the "Anti-Woke"**: Musa al-Gharbi observes that many who critique wokeness often champion the very forces that fueled its rise, such as radical individualism, market fundamentalism, and the disruption of traditional communities. He argues that many "anti-woke" positions are culturally unsustainable and inadvertently reinforce the social atomization in which woke ideology thrives [4].
