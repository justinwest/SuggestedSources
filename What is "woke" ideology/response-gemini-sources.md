# What is "woke" ideology?

Based on the provided sources, "woke" ideology is a term used to describe a political and social belief system primarily concerned with injustice and power dynamics between different identity groups [1]. While the term originated in African American Vernacular English meaning "alert to racial prejudice and discrimination," the sources describe its evolution into a broader ideology with several key characteristics and disputed origins [5, 7].

### Core Tenets

As defined by the sources, the core tenets of "woke" ideology include:

*   **Group Identity and Power Dynamics**: Society is primarily understood as a collection of identity groups (based on race, gender, sexuality, etc.) engaged in a struggle for power. These groups are categorized as either "oppressors" or "the oppressed" [1, 9].
*   **Systemic Injustice**: Racism, sexism, and other forms of prejudice are not seen merely as individual failings but as systems embedded within society's institutions, language, and norms. This framework is heavily influenced by critical theory and postmodernism [1].
*   **Rejection of Universalism**: The ideology tends to be skeptical of classical liberal values like objectivity, meritocracy, and free speech, viewing them as constructs that uphold the power of dominant groups [6, 8, 9].
*   **Epistemology of "Lived Experience"**: It prioritizes knowledge gained from personal experience, particularly the "lived experience" of individuals from marginalized groups. This is sometimes described as a form of "standpoint epistemology," where an individual's social position gives them a privileged insight into the nature of oppression [1].

### Theories on its Origins and Function

The provided sources offer several distinct, and sometimes overlapping, theories about where "woke" ideology comes from and what purpose it serves.

1.  **A Secular Religion**: Several authors argue that wokeness functions as a new, secularized religion, filling the void left by the decline of traditional faith in the West [5].
    *   Curtis Yarvin, in *Gray Mirror*, posits that it is a direct mutation of mainline American Protestantism, particularly its Puritanical and Calvinist strains. He argues it retains the structure, moral fervor, and evangelism of a religion but replaces theological concepts with political ones [3].
    *   Other authors, such as Keith Woods and the reviewer in *Law & Liberty*, compare it to the ancient heresy of Gnosticism. They point to parallels such as a dualistic worldview (oppressor vs. oppressed), the claim to possess special, hidden knowledge (gnosis) about the nature of society, and a desire to radically remake a supposedly corrupt world [9, 10].

2.  **An Intellectual Successor to Postmodernism**: Steve Stewart-Williams traces a direct intellectual lineage from 1960s postmodern philosophers like Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida. He argues that postmodernism's skepticism of objective truth and its focus on power dynamics were channeled through fields like post-colonial theory and critical race theory, eventually coalescing into the popular ideology now known as "woke" [1].

3.  **A Managerial and Status-Signaling Tool**: This theory suggests wokeness serves the interests of a specific socioeconomic class.
    *   The article in *Aporia* describes it as a "managerial ideology" used by the professional-managerial class (academics, journalists, HR professionals, etc.) to legitimize their authority and social status in a post-aristocratic society. It provides a moral justification for their role as society's managers [2].
    *   Similarly, Paul Graham characterizes it as a "moral fashion" that allows the affluent to signal their virtue and status inexpensively. By adopting "woke" positions, they can distinguish themselves from the lower classes and accrue social capital without making tangible sacrifices [7].

4.  **A Consequence of Social and Material Trends**: Michael Shellenberger, in *From Poverty to Progress*, argues that wokeness is the result of several converging trends, including rising prosperity (allowing for a focus on post-materialist concerns), increasing education levels, the decline of religion, and the rise of social media, which accelerates the spread of moral panics and new social norms [5].

5.  **An Ideology Based on a "Great Lie"**: Nathan Cofnas defines "wokeism" as a moral-political project built on what he calls the "Great Lie": the claim that all human populations are, on average, biologically identical in socially relevant traits. He argues that the ideology's core function is to enforce this belief, viewing any discussion of group differences as a moral transgression that must be suppressed [6, 8].

Steve Stewart-Williams argues that "wokeness" is a belief system that emerged from postmodernism and critical theory. He defines it by its core tenets, including its focus on group identity, power dynamics, systemic oppression, and the primacy of "lived experience."
2.  **[Woke as Managerial Ideology](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/woke-as-managerial-ideology)** – *Aporia*. This article posits that "woke" is not just a set of ideas but a functional ideology for the professional-managerial class. It serves to justify their social status and power by framing them as moral arbiters who manage society's injustices.
3.  **[The origin of woke: a George Mason view](https://graymirror.substack.com/p/the-origin-of-woke-a-george-mason)** – *Gray Mirror*. Curtis Yarvin (writing as Mencius Moldbug) argues that "wokeism" is a secularized evolution of mainline American Protestantism. He contends it is essentially a new "state religion" that maintains the moral and social structures of its religious predecessor.
4.  **[The Cultural Contradictions of the Anti‑Woke](https://musaalgharbi.substack.com/p/the-cultural-contradictions-of-the)** – *Musa al‑Gharbi Substack*. Musa al-Gharbi analyzes the "anti-woke" movement, suggesting that it often mirrors the tactics and tendencies of the "woke" ideology it opposes. This perspective frames "woke" as one side of a larger, escalating cultural conflict rather than a standalone phenomenon.
5.  **[Trends that Created the Woke](https://frompovertytoprogress.substack.com/p/trends-that-created-the-woke)** – *From Poverty to Progress*. Michael Shellenberger argues that "woke" ideology arose from a combination of modern trends, including mass prosperity, higher education, secularization, and the influence of social media. He views it as a quasi-religious replacement for traditional faith.
6.  **[Why We Need to Talk about the Right’s Stupidity Problem](https://ncofnas.com/p/why-we-need-to-talk-about-the-rights)** – *Nathan Cofnas’s Newsletter*. Nathan Cofnas defines wokeism as an ideology founded on what he calls the "Great Lie"—the denial of innate, average differences between human population groups. He criticizes the right for failing to effectively challenge this foundational premise.
7.  **[The Origins of Wokeness](https://paulgraham.com/woke.html)** – *PaulGraham.com*. Paul Graham describes wokeness as a "moral fashion" that functions as a status-signaling mechanism, particularly for the upper and upper-middle classes. He argues it's a way to demonstrate moral superiority without cost, comparing its spread to the dynamics of other fashion trends.
8.  **[A Guide for the Hereditarian Revolution](https://ncofnas.com/p/a-guide-for-the-hereditarian-revolution)** – *Nathan Cofnas’s Newsletter*. In this piece, Cofnas reiterates his view of wokeism as a destructive ideology based on the denial of human biodiversity. He argues that accepting "hereditarianism" (the view that genes influence group traits) is necessary to defeat it.
9.  **[Wokeism’s Deeper Roots](https://lawliberty.org/book-review/wokeisms-deeper-roots)** – *Law & Liberty*. This book review traces the intellectual roots of "wokeism" to earlier philosophical movements, including the Gnosticism of antiquity and the thought of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. It frames wokeism as an anti-liberal, anti-reason ideology that seeks to impose a specific vision of virtue on society.
10. **[Gnosticism](https://keithwoods.pub/p/gnosticism)** – *keithwoods.pub*. Keith Woods explicitly argues that "wokeism" is a modern form of Gnosticism. He draws parallels between its dualistic view of the world (good vs. evil, oppressed vs. oppressor), its belief in a special knowledge (gnosis) that reveals the world's corruption, and its aim for salvation through political transformation.
