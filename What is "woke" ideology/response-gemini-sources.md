The term "woke" originated in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), where it historically meant being "awake" to and well-informed about social and racial injustice [11]. Its modern usage was popularized by the Black Lives Matter movement around 2014 to describe a state of awareness regarding issues of systemic racism and inequality [1, 12].

However, the provided sources define "woke" not just as an awareness but as a comprehensive and distinct ideology that has become influential in Western institutions. According to these authors, this ideology is a successor to traditional liberalism and is characterized by a set of core beliefs, historical roots, and social functions [1, 4].

### Core Tenets of Woke Ideology

According to the provided sources, woke ideology is built on several key principles:

*   **Group Identity and Power Dynamics**: The ideology views society primarily through the lens of group identity based on race, gender, and sexuality, rather than focusing on the individual [1, 5]. It posits that society is structured by systems of power and privilege, creating a perpetual conflict between "oppressor" groups (e.g., white, male, heterosexual) and "oppressed" groups [1].
*   **Rejection of Universalism**: It challenges Enlightenment principles like universalism and objective truth. Instead, it prioritizes "lived experience" and subjective perspectives, especially those of individuals from marginalized groups, as a primary source of knowledge and authority [1].
*   **Focus on Disparities as Proof of Injustice**: Woke ideology often assumes that any statistical disparity in outcomes between identity groups is de facto evidence of systemic bias and oppression. This view tends to dismiss or reject alternative explanations for these disparities [5, 6].
*   **The Social Construction of Reality**: A central belief is that human identity and social hierarchies are primarily social constructs. This leads to what Nathan Cofnas terms "bio-denialism," the rejection of biological or genetic explanations for differences in traits or outcomes among human populations, attributing them almost exclusively to social conditioning and power structures [1, 6, 8].
*   **Language as Power**: Drawing on postmodern thought, the ideology sees language not just as a tool for communication but as an instrument of power that creates and reinforces social realities. This leads to a focus on policing language, pronouns, and terminology to dismantle perceived systems of oppression [1].

### Origins and Function

The sources trace the origins of "woke" ideology to several historical and social trends:

*   **A Secularized Religion**: Several authors describe wokeness as a form of secularized religion, particularly as a successor to American Puritanism or mainline Protestantism. Paul Graham and Curtis Yarvin argue that it retains the moral fervor, focus on sin (privilege), and public confession of its religious predecessors but without a deity [3, 7]. This perspective sees the ideology as filling a spiritual void in a secularizing society, with "social justice" as its core theological principle [9]. Others liken it to Gnosticism, where adherents believe they possess a special, hidden knowledge (*gnosis*) about the true nature of society's evils, which is inaccessible to the unenlightened [9, 10].
*   **An Elite-Driven Ideology**: Rather than a grassroots movement, authors like Musa al-Gharbi and the writer for *Aporia* argue that wokeness is an ideology promoted by the professional-managerial class (academics, journalists, HR professionals, non-profit administrators) [2, 4]. From this perspective, it serves as a tool for this class to legitimize its authority, manage social dissent, and distinguish itself from the general populace. Al-Gharbi suggests it emerged as a new consensus for elites after the 2008 financial crisis discredited the previous neoliberal framework [4]. Michael Froman also describes it as a "luxury belief," a set of ideas adopted by affluent, educated people to signal their elite status and moral virtue [5].
*   **Incubation in Academia**: Most sources agree that the core tenets of this ideology were developed over decades in university humanities and social science departments, influenced by Critical Theory, postmodernism, and post-colonial studies [3, 7]. It then spread from academia into media, corporations, and government agencies, a phenomenon referred to as "the Great Awokening" that accelerated around 2012-2014 [1, 5].

In summary, the provided sources define "woke" as an ideology that interprets the world through a lens of identity-based power struggles. They characterize it as a quasi-religious, elite-driven belief system that emerged from academia to challenge traditional liberal norms and assert the authority of a new professional class.
