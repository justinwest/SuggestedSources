Based on the provided sources, "woke" ideology is a term, often used by its critics, to describe a left-leaning political and social framework centered on identifying and opposing perceived systemic injustices. It views society primarily through a lens of power dynamics between different identity groups, such as those based on race, gender, and sexuality [1, 2].

### Core Tenets and Beliefs

A central tenet of this ideology is that society is structured by systems of oppression, such as "systemic racism," "patriarchy," and "cisheteronormativity," which benefit dominant groups (e.g., white, male, heterosexual, cisgender people) at the expense of marginalized ones [1, 4]. Consequently, "social justice" is often defined not as ensuring equal opportunity but as achieving "equity," meaning equal outcomes, which may require treating people differently based on their group identity to correct for historical and systemic imbalances [1, 6].

This worldview often rejects Enlightenment values like universalism, individualism, and objective truth. Instead, it elevates "lived experience" and subjective "ways of knowing" tied to one's identity group as more authentic or valid than objective evidence or scientific inquiry, particularly in social matters [1, 6, 8]. According to some critics, this has led to the belief that modern Western societies are fundamentally and irredeemably flawed by their oppressive structures [3, 7].

### Origins and Influences

The sources trace the origins of this ideology to several distinct but overlapping historical and intellectual movements:

*   **Intellectual History**: Author Steve Stewart-Williams describes "wokeness" as a "successor ideology" that evolved from the Civil Rights movement and was later heavily influenced by European intellectual traditions like postmodernism (Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida) and critical theory (the Frankfurt School). These traditions provided the tools for deconstructing traditional norms, language, and power structures [1].
*   **The "Great Awokening"**: Sociologist Musa al-Gharbi and others point to a quantifiable shift in the language and attitudes of white, college-educated liberals beginning around 2011-2014, a phenomenon termed the "Great Awokening" [4, 5]. This ideological transformation, accelerated by the rise of social media, saw a dramatic increase in the use of terms related to social justice and a sharp turn toward more radical positions on race and identity [4].
*   **Historical Parallels**: Several sources, including Paul Graham and Curtis Yarvin, draw a parallel between the moral fervor, public shaming ("cancel culture"), and dogmatism of "woke" ideology and earlier religious movements, particularly American Puritanism [3, 7]. They argue it functions as a new, secular religion for an increasingly non-religious elite, providing a source of meaning, moral righteousness, and community [5, 7].

### Sociological and Functional Explanations

Beyond its tenets and history, the sources offer several functional explanations for why "woke" ideology has become influential, especially among Western elites:

*   **Managerial Ideology**: N.S. Lyons argues that "wokeness" functions as a "managerial ideology" that serves the interests of the professional-managerial class (PMC). It provides a moral justification for their authority and creates a new layer of bureaucratic control through Human Resources and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) departments. This framework helps manage and pacify a diverse population while legitimizing the power of the elite that promotes it [2].
*   **Status Signaling and Symbolic Capital**: For educated elites, adopting the language and attitudes of "wokeness" serves as a powerful status symbol. It signals one's virtue, educational attainment, and membership in a high-status cultural group, distinguishing them from the "deplorable" masses [4]. Musa al-Gharbi refers to this as accumulating "symbolic capital" [4].
*   **A Response to Scientific Claims**: According to N. Cofnas, "woke" ideology is in part a defensive reaction against scientific findings, particularly in fields like behavioral genetics, that challenge its foundational belief in social constructionism. By insisting that all group disparities are solely the result of "systemic oppression," it aims to delegitimize and suppress research into potential biological or hereditary factors [6, 8].

It emphasizes the rejection of universalism and the focus on group identity and power dynamics. ([link](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/where-did-wokeness-come-from))

He argues it serves as a tool for social control, justifies the power of the elite, and creates new bureaucratic structures (like DEI) that reinforce their authority.

He sees it as an intolerant, expansionist ideology inherent to the American establishment. ([link](https://graymirror.substack.com/p/the-origin-of-woke-a-george-mason))
4.  **Musa al-Gharbi, "The Cultural Contradictions of the American 'Elite'"**: This sociological analysis argues that "wokeness" functions as a status-signaling system for elites. He documents the "Great Awokening" and explains how adopting these beliefs and linguistic norms (symbolic capital) allows elites to distinguish themselves from the general population.

He posits that declining faith in traditional religion and national identity created a spiritual void that is now filled by a new victimhood-focused, pseudo-religious moral framework.

6.  **N. Cofnas, "Why We Need to Talk About the Rights' Causal Theory of Disparities"**: Cofnas argues that a core, non-negotiable axiom of "woke" ideology is that all statistical disparities between identity groups must be caused by "systemic injustice." He critiques this as an unfalsifiable dogma that obstructs scientific inquiry into other potential causes. ([link](https://ncofnas.com/p/why-we-need-to-talk-about-the-rights))
7.  **Paul Graham, "Woke"**: Graham describes "woke" as a moral fashion characterized by its intolerance and focus on punishment. He compares it to historical phenomena like Puritanism, arguing it enforces conformity by creating a climate of fear where people are afraid to question its tenets.

8.  **N. Cofnas, "A Guide for the Hereditarian Revolution"**: This essay defines "wokeness" as an ideological opponent to "hereditarianism" (the view that heredity plays a significant role in human traits). Cofnas asserts that the ideology's main function is to suppress and deny scientific realities about human biological diversity. ([link](https://ncofnas.com/p/a-guide-for-the-hereditarian-revolution))
