"Woke" and "wokeness" are highly contested terms whose meanings have evolved significantly. Originally, the term "woke" emerged from African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) to mean being awake to and aware of systemic injustices, particularly racism [7, 8]. Over the last decade, its usage has broadened and become a focal point of cultural and political debate.

### The Original Meaning and Evolution

The term "stay woke" gained prominence within activist circles, especially following the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement around 2014. In this context, it served as a call to action to remain vigilant about police brutality, racial prejudice, and other forms of social inequality [8]. The Oxford English Dictionary defines "woke" as being "originally: well-informed, up-to-date. Now chiefly: alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice" [9].

However, the term was quickly adopted, and often appropriated, by a wider audience. By the late 2010s, it began to be used pejoratively by critics to describe a specific set of progressive ideologies they viewed as extreme, performative, or censorious [4, 8].

### Key Tenets Attributed to Wokeness

The provided sources, which are largely critical or analytical, identify several core tenets associated with the modern concept of "wokeness":

*   **A Focus on Systemic Power and Identity:** Wokeness is characterized by a framework that views society through the lens of power dynamics between identity groups (e.g., race, gender, sexuality) [1, 6]. It posits that systems and institutions are inherently biased and structured to benefit dominant groups (e.g., white, male, heterosexual) while oppressing marginalized ones [1].
*   **Centrality of "Lived Experience":** Proponents of this worldview often prioritize subjective "lived experience," especially the experience of belonging to a marginalized group, as a valid form of evidence, sometimes placing it on par with or above objective data [4].
*   **The Primacy of Disparities:** Disparities in outcomes between identity groups are often treated as prima facie evidence of systemic bias or discrimination. The absence of proportional representation is seen as a problem that requires active intervention [4].
*   **Critique of Universalism and Objectivity:** Some of the philosophical underpinnings of wokeness are linked to postmodern thought, which is skeptical of universal truths, objective reality, and classical liberal values like free speech and individual rights [1, 6]. These values are sometimes viewed as tools that uphold the existing oppressive power structures [6].
*   **Prescriptive Language and Norms:** There is a strong emphasis on using specific, approved language and terminology to avoid causing offense and to signal ideological alignment. This can lead to strict social norms and swift condemnation for perceived transgressions [4].

### Theories on the Origin of Wokeness

The sources offer several distinct, though sometimes overlapping, theories about how and why "wokeness" emerged as a dominant force in Western institutions.

1.  **A Secular Religion:** Several analysts describe wokeness as functioning like a new, secular religion. Curtis Yarvin argues it is a direct continuation of a specific strain of American Protestantism, tracing a lineage from 17th-century Puritanism through various progressive movements to the present day. In his view, concepts like original sin, public confession, and heresy have been secularized into ideas like privilege, public apologies for microaggressions, and "cancellation" [3]. Michael Powell also posits that it fills a "God-shaped hole" left by declining traditional religious belief, providing a source of meaning, community, and moral righteousness [5].

2.  **An Ideology of the Managerial Class:** Another theory frames wokeness not as a grassroots movement but as a top-down "managerial ideology." The argument, detailed in *Aporia Magazine*, is that this ideology serves the interests of the professional-managerial class (academics, HR professionals, journalists, non-profit administrators). By creating complex and ever-changing rules around language and social conduct, this class solidifies its own authority and creates a demand for its administrative and interpretive skills, thereby justifying its power and status within institutions [2].

3.  **The "Great Awokening":** Sociologist Musa al-Gharbi identifies a phenomenon he calls the "Great Awokening," a rapid and dramatic leftward shift in the views of white liberals, starting around 2014 [4]. He argues this shift was not driven by the marginalized groups it purports to champion, but rather by elite actors and institutions. He points to data showing this ideological transformation was most pronounced among educated, affluent white Democrats and was amplified by changes in media, academia, and corporate culture [4].

4.  **A Product of Societal Trends:** Michael Powell suggests that wokeness is the result of a confluence of several recent trends, including:
    *   **The Rise of Social Media:** Platforms that incentivize moral grandstanding and public shaming.
    *   **"Luxury Beliefs":** Affluent individuals adopt beliefs that confer status but may have negative consequences for lower-class communities.
    *   **Political Polarization:** The increasing division between political parties, leading to more extreme ideological positions.
    *   **The Decline of Class-Based Politics:** A shift away from economic issues and toward cultural and identity-based conflicts [5].

5.  **A Legacy of Philosophical Ideas:** Steve Stewart-Williams traces the intellectual roots of wokeness to 20th-century philosophical movements like postmodernism and critical theory. These schools of thought challenged Enlightenment ideals, questioned objective truth, and focused on deconstructing language and power, providing the foundational concepts for today's identity-focused activism [1].
