"Woke" ideology, often referred to as "wokeness," is a multifaceted and contested concept that has evolved significantly over time. At its core, it represents a heightened awareness of social injustices, particularly those related to race, gender, sexuality, and other identity-based inequalities, with an emphasis on systemic oppression and the need for societal change [1][11]. Originally emerging from African American Vernacular English in the early 20th century, "woke" meant staying alert to racial prejudice and discrimination, as popularized in phrases like "stay woke" in the 1930s and later in protest movements [11]. In contemporary usage, however, it has broadened into a political and cultural ideology that critiques power structures, promotes equity through identity politics, and often advocates for policies like affirmative action, diversity initiatives, and restrictions on speech deemed harmful [2][7].

### Historical Origins and Evolution
The term "woke" gained prominence in the 2010s through movements like Black Lives Matter, where it signified awareness of police brutality and systemic racism [11]. Sources trace its ideological roots to various influences, including postmodern philosophy, critical theory (e.g., from thinkers like Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida), and civil rights activism [1][7][9]. For instance, some analyses link wokeness to the expansion of higher education and the rise of "safetyism" in universities, where protecting marginalized groups from perceived harm became a priority [5]. Others argue it emerged as a managerial tool in corporate and institutional settings, enforcing conformity through diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs to mitigate legal risks and maintain social order [2][3].

Critics often portray wokeness as an outgrowth of left-wing ideologies that prioritize group identities over individual merit, leading to what they describe as "cancel culture" and ideological intolerance [6][7][8]. One perspective frames it as a successor to older progressive movements, influenced by trends like urbanization, secularization, and the decline of traditional values, which created fertile ground for identity-based activism [5]. However, not all views are uniformly critical; some highlight internal contradictions, such as how anti-woke rhetoric on the right can mirror the identity politics it opposes [4].

### Core Tenets and Beliefs
Woke ideology typically encompasses several key principles:
- **Systemic Oppression**: A belief that societal structures perpetuate inequality based on race, gender, class, and other identities. This draws from intersectionality, a framework coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, which examines how overlapping identities compound disadvantage [12].
- **Equity Over Equality**: Emphasis on achieving equal outcomes rather than just equal opportunities, often through redistributive policies and representation quotas [2][7].
- **Language and Cultural Sensitivity**: Advocacy for inclusive language, trigger warnings, and deplatforming offensive views to create "safe spaces" [1][5].
- **Critique of Meritocracy**: The idea that traditional notions of merit are biased toward privileged groups, necessitating interventions like DEI training [8][9].

Proponents see wokeness as a moral imperative for justice, while detractors argue it fosters division, suppresses free speech, and enforces a new orthodoxy [6][10]. For example, some sources critique it as a "Gnostic heresy" or pseudo-religion, though this view is disputed as an oversimplification [10].

### Criticisms and Broader Context
Many of the provided sources approach wokeness from a skeptical or conservative lens, suggesting it arises from elite institutions (e.g., universities and corporations) and serves to consolidate power [3][7]. One argues it's tied to "hereditarian" debates on intelligence and race, positioning anti-woke efforts as a counter-revolution [8]. Another posits that wokeness fills a void left by declining religious faith, adopting quasi-spiritual elements [9]. However, to ensure balance, it's worth noting that wokeness is not monolithic; it varies by context, and some defenders view it as essential for addressing real inequalities [12][13].

In summary, "woke" ideology is a dynamic framework for understanding and combating social inequities, but it remains polarizing, with interpretations ranging from emancipatory to authoritarian depending on the observer [4][6].
