"Woke" and "wokeness" are terms that have evolved significantly in meaning and usage over time, originating in African American Vernacular English and expanding into broader cultural, political, and ideological contexts. At its core, "woke" refers to being aware of and attentive to issues of social injustice, particularly those related to race, gender, sexuality, and systemic inequalities [7]. "Wokeness" is often used to describe the broader ideology, mindset, or cultural movement associated with this awareness, emphasizing progressive activism, identity politics, and critiques of power structures. However, the terms are highly contested, with positive connotations among supporters (as a call for equity and empathy) and negative ones among critics (who see it as dogmatic, performative, or authoritarian) [1][2][6][8].

### Origins and Historical Evolution
The term "woke" first emerged in the 1930s within African American communities, notably in protest songs like Scottsboro Boys by Lead Belly, where it meant staying alert to danger and injustice, especially racial discrimination [7]. It gained renewed prominence in the 2010s through the Black Lives Matter movement, where phrases like "stay woke" encouraged awareness of police brutality and systemic racism [7][8]. Over time, its scope broadened beyond race to encompass feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, environmentalism, and anti-capitalist sentiments, influenced by academic fields like critical race theory, intersectionality, and postcolonial studies [1][4].

Several sources trace wokeness to deeper historical and societal trends. For instance, it is linked to the Protestant Reformation's emphasis on moral purity and social reform, evolving through American Puritanism, abolitionism, and 20th-century civil rights movements [1]. Others connect it to post-1960s cultural shifts, including the rise of higher education, affluence, and the decline of traditional institutions, which fostered a "successor ideology" to liberalism focused on equity over equality [5]. Critically, some view wokeness as an outgrowth of managerial ideologies in elite institutions, where it serves as a tool for social control and professional advancement rather than genuine activism [2][3].

### Key Characteristics and Ideological Components
Wokeness is characterized by several interconnected ideas:
- **Awareness of Systemic Oppression**: A central tenet is recognizing "invisible" structures of privilege and discrimination, such as white supremacy, patriarchy, and heteronormativity. This draws from concepts like intersectionality, coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, which examines how overlapping identities (e.g., race, gender, class) compound disadvantage [7][4].
- **Identity Politics and Group-Based Justice**: It prioritizes group identities over individualism, advocating for policies like affirmative action, diversity initiatives, and reparations to address historical inequities [6]. Critics argue this can lead to "victimhood culture" or reverse discrimination [1][5].
- **Cultural and Linguistic Sensitivity**: Wokeness often involves policing language (e.g., preferred pronouns, avoiding microaggressions) and promoting "cancel culture" to hold individuals accountable for perceived harms [2][8].
- **Moral and Emotional Dimensions**: It emphasizes empathy for marginalized groups and moral outrage against injustice, sometimes manifesting as a quasi-religious fervor with rituals like public apologies or virtue signaling [1][3].

From a sociological perspective, wokeness is seen as a response to modern contradictions, such as the tension between meritocracy and persistent inequalities in knowledge-based economies [4]. It thrives in elite spaces like universities, corporations, and media, where it aligns with "symbolic capitalism" – using progressive rhetoric to maintain status hierarchies [4][2].

### Criticisms and Alternative Perspectives
While supporters view wokeness as essential for progress, critics from the provided sources often frame it negatively. For example, it is described as a "managerial ideology" that enforces conformity in professional environments, suppressing dissent under the guise of inclusivity [2]. Others trace its origins to mid-20th-century academic and bureaucratic shifts, portraying it as a distorted evolution of civil rights into an intolerant orthodoxy [3][6]. Some argue it arises from societal trends like urbanization, secularization, and the expansion of higher education, which create echo chambers for extreme views [5]. There's also a call to examine "right-wing wokeness," such as identity politics among conservatives, to avoid one-sided critiques [6].

In contrast, neutral definitions emphasize its grassroots origins in anti-oppression movements, cautioning against its co-optation by elites or its weaponization in culture wars [7][8]. The term's pejorative use surged around 2017, often by conservatives to mock perceived over-sensitivity, leading to backlash and semantic shifts [7].

### Contemporary Usage and Impact
Today, "woke" is ubiquitous in politics, media, and business, influencing everything from corporate DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) programs to public policy debates. Its global spread has sparked movements like #MeToo and climate activism, but also polarized societies, contributing to phenomena like "anti-woke" backlashes in elections [5][6]. Understanding wokeness requires recognizing its fluidity: what began as a call to awareness has become a multifaceted ideology, tool for power, and cultural flashpoint.
