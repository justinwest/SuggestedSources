**Woke** is an adjective that originally means being ‚Äúawake‚Äù to social injustices and racial discrimination ‚Äì in other words, being keenly aware of systemic inequities and prejudices in society ([www.merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/woke#:~:text=1)) ([www.merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wokeness#:~:text=woke%C2%B7%E2%80%8Bness%20%CB%88w%C5%8Dk)). The term comes from African American Vernacular English; to ‚Äústay woke‚Äù in Black communities historically meant to remain alert to racial bias and injustice. Early uses of *woke* in this context go back to the mid-20th century. For example, in 1962 the African-American novelist William Melvin Kelley used *woke* in a New York Times essay explaining black slang (‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre woke, you dig it‚Äù), signaling that *woke* meant socially conscious or aware ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=The%20Economist%20writes%20that%20the,%E2%80%9D)). The idea of waking up to unjust realities also appeared in activism of the 1970s ‚Äì a character in a 1972 play about Marcus Garvey declares he was ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù until enlightened and now vows to ‚Äústay woke‚Äù to help awaken others ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=A%20decade%20later%2C%20a%20character,wake%20up%20other%20black%20folk%E2%80%9D)). In essence, *woke* came to describe an alertness to racial or social discrimination and the need for action against it. **Wokeness**, as a noun, refers to the state of being ‚Äúwoke‚Äù ‚Äì that is, a broad awareness of social injustices and a commitment to addressing them ([www.merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wokeness#:~:text=woke%C2%B7%E2%80%8Bness%20%CB%88w%C5%8Dk)). It can also denote the broader *ideology or movement* centered on such social consciousness.

In modern usage, *woke* and *wokeness* entered the mainstream during the 2010s amid rising social justice movements. The phrase ‚Äústay woke‚Äù was popularized in 2014 during the Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson, Missouri, as a caution to remain watchful for racial injustice (particularly police brutality) ([www.vox.com](https://www.vox.com/culture/21437879/stay-woke-wokeness-history-origin-evolution-controversy#:~:text=Before%202014%2C%20the%20call%20to,brutality%20and%20unjust%20police%20tactics)) ([www.vox.com](https://www.vox.com/culture/21437879/stay-woke-wokeness-history-origin-evolution-controversy#:~:text=staying%20%E2%80%9Cwoke%E2%80%9D%20and%20alert%20to,brutality%20and%20unjust%20police%20tactics)). Through social media and activism, *woke* evolved from African-American slang into a wider colloquial term signaling awareness of issues like racism, sexism, and other forms of inequality. By the late 2010s, major dictionaries had recognized this shift. For instance, in 2017 the Oxford English Dictionary added *woke* in its new sense, defining it as ‚Äúalert to racial or social discrimination and injustice‚Äù ([time.com](https://time.com/4830959/oxford-english-dictionary-woke/#:~:text=%3E%20woke%2C%20adjective%3A%20Originally%3A%20well,injustice%3B%20frequently%20in%20stay%20woke)). Similarly, Merriam-Webster‚Äôs dictionary defines *woke* as ‚Äúaware of and actively attentive to important facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice)‚Äù ([www.merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/woke#:~:text=1)). Originally rooted in racial justice, the term broadened to encompass a generalized left-leaning social awareness, including causes such as gender equality and LGBTQ+ rights ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke#:~:text=political%20connotations%20by%20the%201970s,slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States)) ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=adjective,with%20race%20and%20more%20ideology)). In other words, being *‚Äúwoke‚Äù* in today‚Äôs context means being informed about social inequalities and supportive of efforts to address them.

However, *woke* has also become a contested term with different connotations depending on who uses it. On the political left or among progressives, *woke* is often used positively to signify a heightened consciousness about social injustice and a proactive stance in fighting inequality ([www.vox.com](https://www.vox.com/culture/21437879/stay-woke-wokeness-history-origin-evolution-controversy#:~:text=leftist%20culture%20by%20the%20right)). To call oneself *woke* (or to be called woke) in this sense implies one is socially aware, empathetic toward marginalized groups, and committed to progressive reform. Advocates see *wokeness* as an extension of moral vigilance ‚Äì a virtue signaling one‚Äôs dedication to fairness and inclusion. For example, psychologist Michael Karson describes wokeness as fundamentally *‚Äúa good thing‚Äù* ‚Äì an awareness of unfairness that makes society better by fostering empathy for the marginalized ([www.psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/feeling-our-way/202108/the-psychology-wokeism?amp=#:~:text=Wokeness%2C%20in%20my%20view%2C%20is,to%20live%20in%20for%20everyone)). In this view, *wokeness* means actively remaining informed about issues like racial bias, MeToo and gender inequality, or LGBTQ discrimination, and supporting measures to remedy these injustices. Those who embrace the term often consider it synonymous with social justice consciousness and view it as a **moral duty** to ‚Äústay woke‚Äù in order to challenge systemic ills ([www.vox.com](https://www.vox.com/culture/21437879/stay-woke-wokeness-history-origin-evolution-controversy#:~:text=On%20the%20left%2C%20to%20be,Consider%20the%20%204%202020)) ([www.psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/feeling-our-way/202108/the-psychology-wokeism?amp=#:~:text=Wokeness%2C%20in%20my%20view%2C%20is,to%20live%20in%20for%20everyone)). 

In contrast, many conservative and centrist voices now use *‚Äúwoke‚Äù* as a pejorative term. On the political right, *woke* is often deployed sarcastically or derogatorily to label what they perceive as overzealous or misguided progressive culture ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=Hide%20Ad)) ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=%E2%80%9COn%20the%20right%2C%20%E2%80%9Cwoke%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%94,%E2%80%9D)). Critics argue that *wokeness* in practice can amount to performative activism, excessive ‚Äúpolitical correctness,‚Äù or even an irrational ideology. For instance, they point to instances of ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù and say that *woke* ideals enforce a strict conformity of language and thought ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=In%20recent%20years%2C%20the%20word,health%20consequences%20can%20be%20dangerous)) ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=progressive%20activism%20has%20been%20widely,by%20many%20over%20the%20years)). The term *‚Äúwoke‚Äù* in conservative usage has become a catch-all for a range of modern progressive positions ‚Äì from diversity and inclusion initiatives to debates about gender identity ‚Äì all of which are viewed skeptically as extreme or ill-founded. Prominent right-wing figures have openly condemned *wokeness* as a damaging force: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, for example, calls *‚Äúthe woke mind virus‚Äù* a *‚Äúwar on merit‚Äù* and *‚Äúa war on achievement,‚Äù* claiming that woke ideology undermines traditional values and objective standards ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=As%20with%20many%20cultural%20phenomena,%E2%80%9D)) ([www.telegraph.co.uk](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/05/25/ron-desantis-interview-disney-covid-war-on-wokery/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWoke%20ideologyundermines%20merit%20and%20achievement,%E2%80%9D)). By 2019, it was common for opponents to use *woke* as an insult, suggesting someone is a self-righteous ‚Äúsocial justice warrior‚Äù or engaging in shallow virtue-signaling ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke#:~:text=By%202019%2C%20the%20term%20was,progressive%20messaging%20for%20financial%20gain)) ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=In%20short%2C%20it%20is%20bipartisan%3A,by%20misguided%20or%20performative%20activism)). In this sense, being labeled *woke* by others can imply one is part of an illiberal leftist orthodoxy or that one‚Äôs awareness of social issues is performative and not based in practical reality ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=In%20short%2C%20it%20is%20bipartisan%3A,by%20misguided%20or%20performative%20activism)). Indeed, to these critics *wokeness* has come to represent *‚Äúpolitical correctness gone awry‚Äù* ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=%E2%80%9COn%20the%20right%2C%20%E2%80%9Cwoke%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%94,%E2%80%9D)) ‚Äì an ideology that they argue stifles free speech, erodes meritocracy, and even *‚Äúcorrupts‚Äù* institutions by prioritizing identity politics over competence or truth ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=As%20with%20many%20cultural%20phenomena,%E2%80%9D)) ([www.telegraph.co.uk](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/05/25/ron-desantis-interview-disney-covid-war-on-wokery/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWoke%20ideologyundermines%20merit%20and%20achievement,%E2%80%9D)).

Beyond the polarized political battle over the term, there is also debate about the sincerity and impact of *wokeness*. Some observers (including moderate liberals and left-wing commentators) have cautioned that *wokeness* can sometimes devolve into empty posturing or intolerance, betraying the term‚Äôs original ideals. For example, **Michael Karson** warns that every social movement faces the risk of becoming what it hates; in his view, *‚Äúwokeness‚Äù* can slide into **‚Äúwokeism,‚Äù** a rigid mindset **‚Äúcharacterized by intolerance, policing the speech of others, and proving one‚Äôs own superiority by denouncing others,‚Äù** rather than true compassion ([www.psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/feeling-our-way/202108/the-psychology-wokeism?amp=#:~:text=On%20the%20political%20left%2C%20wokeness,others%20have%20written%20extensively%20about)) ([www.psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/feeling-our-way/202108/the-psychology-wokeism?amp=#:~:text=On%20the%20political%20left%2C%20wokeness,others%20have%20written%20extensively%20about)). This critique suggests that some self-identified *woke* activists may focus on performatively shaming or ‚Äúcancelling‚Äù others to display moral purity, instead of effecting meaningful change ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=In%20recent%20years%2C%20the%20word,health%20consequences%20can%20be%20dangerous)) ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20there%20are%20those%20in,moves%20or%20rhetoric%20gone%20awry)). Additionally, the mainstreaming of *woke* rhetoric has led to instances of corporate and political opportunism. Companies have been accused of *‚Äúwoke-washing‚Äù* or *‚Äúwoke capitalism‚Äù* ‚Äì adopting superficial progressive branding (such as rainbow logos during Pride Month or diverse marketing campaigns) while avoiding substantive changes, a practice that brings its own backlash ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=performative%20activism)) ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=As%20Psychology%20Today%20wrote%3A%20%E2%80%9CIn,by%20many%20over%20the%20years)). Such examples feed the argument that *wokeness* can sometimes be hollow or hypocritical, which even some proponents of social justice find concerning. 

In summary, **‚Äúwoke‚Äù** can either be a badge of awareness or an epithet, depending on context. *Woke* began as a term urging people to stay alert to racial and social injustices, and many still use it to denote a praiseworthy consciousness of inequality and commitment to reform [1][5]. At the same time, *wokeness* has evolved into a broader concept ‚Äì often politicized ‚Äì that some celebrate as enlightened progressive values and others deride as an overzealous, even detrimental, trend [2][3]. The divergence in meaning is so pronounced that one writer observed *‚Äúwhat ‚Äòwoke‚Äô means depends on who‚Äôs defining it.‚Äù* ([www.scotsman.com](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/woke-meaning-definition-4467326#:~:text=Being%20conscious%20and%20aware%2C%20embracing,depends%20on%20who%E2%80%99s%20defining%20it)) For supporters, wokeness means being *morally awake* to injustice and striving for a more equitable society. For its critics, *woke* has become shorthand for a pretentious or extreme brand of progressivism divorced from common sense. As a result, the term sits at the center of contemporary culture wars, with *‚Äúwoke‚Äù* and *‚Äúanti-woke‚Äù* camps using it as a rallying cry on opposite sides of debates. In effect, *woke* and *wokeness* encapsulate a ongoing conflict over social values ‚Äì either representing the pursuit of social justice or, conversely, a subject of scorn for those who feel that pursuit has gone too far [2][4]. The meaning continues to evolve, but at its core *to be woke* still implies a call to **awareness** ‚Äì whether one views that as a virtue or a vice.

# ü§ñ Gemini's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

"Woke" and "wokeness" are highly contested terms whose meanings have evolved significantly. Originally, the term "woke" emerged from African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) to mean being awake to and aware of systemic injustices, particularly racism [7, 8]. Over the last decade, its usage has broadened and become a focal point of cultural and political debate.

### The Original Meaning and Evolution

The term "stay woke" gained prominence within activist circles, especially following the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement around 2014. In this context, it served as a call to action to remain vigilant about police brutality, racial prejudice, and other forms of social inequality [8]. The Oxford English Dictionary defines "woke" as being "originally: well-informed, up-to-date. Now chiefly: alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice" [9].

However, the term was quickly adopted, and often appropriated, by a wider audience. By the late 2010s, it began to be used pejoratively by critics to describe a specific set of progressive ideologies they viewed as extreme, performative, or censorious [4, 8].

### Key Tenets Attributed to Wokeness

The provided sources, which are largely critical or analytical, identify several core tenets associated with the modern concept of "wokeness":

*   **A Focus on Systemic Power and Identity:** Wokeness is characterized by a framework that views society through the lens of power dynamics between identity groups (e.g., race, gender, sexuality) [1, 6]. It posits that systems and institutions are inherently biased and structured to benefit dominant groups (e.g., white, male, heterosexual) while oppressing marginalized ones [1].
*   **Centrality of "Lived Experience":** Proponents of this worldview often prioritize subjective "lived experience," especially the experience of belonging to a marginalized group, as a valid form of evidence, sometimes placing it on par with or above objective data [4].
*   **The Primacy of Disparities:** Disparities in outcomes between identity groups are often treated as prima facie evidence of systemic bias or discrimination. The absence of proportional representation is seen as a problem that requires active intervention [4].
*   **Critique of Universalism and Objectivity:** Some of the philosophical underpinnings of wokeness are linked to postmodern thought, which is skeptical of universal truths, objective reality, and classical liberal values like free speech and individual rights [1, 6]. These values are sometimes viewed as tools that uphold the existing oppressive power structures [6].
*   **Prescriptive Language and Norms:** There is a strong emphasis on using specific, approved language and terminology to avoid causing offense and to signal ideological alignment. This can lead to strict social norms and swift condemnation for perceived transgressions [4].

### Theories on the Origin of Wokeness

The sources offer several distinct, though sometimes overlapping, theories about how and why "wokeness" emerged as a dominant force in Western institutions.

1.  **A Secular Religion:** Several analysts describe wokeness as functioning like a new, secular religion. Curtis Yarvin argues it is a direct continuation of a specific strain of American Protestantism, tracing a lineage from 17th-century Puritanism through various progressive movements to the present day. In his view, concepts like original sin, public confession, and heresy have been secularized into ideas like privilege, public apologies for microaggressions, and "cancellation" [3]. Michael Powell also posits that it fills a "God-shaped hole" left by declining traditional religious belief, providing a source of meaning, community, and moral righteousness [5].

2.  **An Ideology of the Managerial Class:** Another theory frames wokeness not as a grassroots movement but as a top-down "managerial ideology." The argument, detailed in *Aporia Magazine*, is that this ideology serves the interests of the professional-managerial class (academics, HR professionals, journalists, non-profit administrators). By creating complex and ever-changing rules around language and social conduct, this class solidifies its own authority and creates a demand for its administrative and interpretive skills, thereby justifying its power and status within institutions [2].

3.  **The "Great Awokening":** Sociologist Musa al-Gharbi identifies a phenomenon he calls the "Great Awokening," a rapid and dramatic leftward shift in the views of white liberals, starting around 2014 [4]. He argues this shift was not driven by the marginalized groups it purports to champion, but rather by elite actors and institutions. He points to data showing this ideological transformation was most pronounced among educated, affluent white Democrats and was amplified by changes in media, academia, and corporate culture [4].

4.  **A Product of Societal Trends:** Michael Powell suggests that wokeness is the result of a confluence of several recent trends, including:
    *   **The Rise of Social Media:** Platforms that incentivize moral grandstanding and public shaming.
    *   **"Luxury Beliefs":** Affluent individuals adopt beliefs that confer status but may have negative consequences for lower-class communities.
    *   **Political Polarization:** The increasing division between political parties, leading to more extreme ideological positions.
    *   **The Decline of Class-Based Politics:** A shift away from economic issues and toward cultural and identity-based conflicts [5].

5.  **A Legacy of Philosophical Ideas:** Steve Stewart-Williams traces the intellectual roots of wokeness to 20th-century philosophical movements like postmodernism and critical theory. These schools of thought challenged Enlightenment ideals, questioned objective truth, and focused on deconstructing language and power, providing the foundational concepts for today's identity-focused activism [1].

1.  **Steve Stewart-Williams, "Where Did Wokeness Come From?"**

# ü§ñ Grok's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

"Woke" and "wokeness" are terms that have evolved significantly in meaning and usage over time, originating in African American Vernacular English and expanding into broader cultural, political, and ideological contexts. At its core, "woke" refers to being aware of and attentive to issues of social injustice, particularly those related to race, gender, sexuality, and systemic inequalities [7]. "Wokeness" is often used to describe the broader ideology, mindset, or cultural movement associated with this awareness, emphasizing progressive activism, identity politics, and critiques of power structures. However, the terms are highly contested, with positive connotations among supporters (as a call for equity and empathy) and negative ones among critics (who see it as dogmatic, performative, or authoritarian) [1][2][6][8].

### Origins and Historical Evolution
The term "woke" first emerged in the 1930s within African American communities, notably in protest songs like Scottsboro Boys by Lead Belly, where it meant staying alert to danger and injustice, especially racial discrimination [7]. It gained renewed prominence in the 2010s through the Black Lives Matter movement, where phrases like "stay woke" encouraged awareness of police brutality and systemic racism [7][8]. Over time, its scope broadened beyond race to encompass feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, environmentalism, and anti-capitalist sentiments, influenced by academic fields like critical race theory, intersectionality, and postcolonial studies [1][4].

Several sources trace wokeness to deeper historical and societal trends. For instance, it is linked to the Protestant Reformation's emphasis on moral purity and social reform, evolving through American Puritanism, abolitionism, and 20th-century civil rights movements [1]. Others connect it to post-1960s cultural shifts, including the rise of higher education, affluence, and the decline of traditional institutions, which fostered a "successor ideology" to liberalism focused on equity over equality [5]. Critically, some view wokeness as an outgrowth of managerial ideologies in elite institutions, where it serves as a tool for social control and professional advancement rather than genuine activism [2][3].

### Key Characteristics and Ideological Components
Wokeness is characterized by several interconnected ideas:
- **Awareness of Systemic Oppression**: A central tenet is recognizing "invisible" structures of privilege and discrimination, such as white supremacy, patriarchy, and heteronormativity. This draws from concepts like intersectionality, coined by Kimberl√© Crenshaw, which examines how overlapping identities (e.g., race, gender, class) compound disadvantage [7][4].
- **Identity Politics and Group-Based Justice**: It prioritizes group identities over individualism, advocating for policies like affirmative action, diversity initiatives, and reparations to address historical inequities [6]. Critics argue this can lead to "victimhood culture" or reverse discrimination [1][5].
- **Cultural and Linguistic Sensitivity**: Wokeness often involves policing language (e.g., preferred pronouns, avoiding microaggressions) and promoting "cancel culture" to hold individuals accountable for perceived harms [2][8].
- **Moral and Emotional Dimensions**: It emphasizes empathy for marginalized groups and moral outrage against injustice, sometimes manifesting as a quasi-religious fervor with rituals like public apologies or virtue signaling [1][3].

From a sociological perspective, wokeness is seen as a response to modern contradictions, such as the tension between meritocracy and persistent inequalities in knowledge-based economies [4]. It thrives in elite spaces like universities, corporations, and media, where it aligns with "symbolic capitalism" ‚Äì using progressive rhetoric to maintain status hierarchies [4][2].

### Criticisms and Alternative Perspectives
While supporters view wokeness as essential for progress, critics from the provided sources often frame it negatively. For example, it is described as a "managerial ideology" that enforces conformity in professional environments, suppressing dissent under the guise of inclusivity [2]. Others trace its origins to mid-20th-century academic and bureaucratic shifts, portraying it as a distorted evolution of civil rights into an intolerant orthodoxy [3][6]. Some argue it arises from societal trends like urbanization, secularization, and the expansion of higher education, which create echo chambers for extreme views [5]. There's also a call to examine "right-wing wokeness," such as identity politics among conservatives, to avoid one-sided critiques [6].

In contrast, neutral definitions emphasize its grassroots origins in anti-oppression movements, cautioning against its co-optation by elites or its weaponization in culture wars [7][8]. The term's pejorative use surged around 2017, often by conservatives to mock perceived over-sensitivity, leading to backlash and semantic shifts [7].

### Contemporary Usage and Impact
Today, "woke" is ubiquitous in politics, media, and business, influencing everything from corporate DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) programs to public policy debates. Its global spread has sparked movements like #MeToo and climate activism, but also polarized societies, contributing to phenomena like "anti-woke" backlashes in elections [5][6]. Understanding wokeness requires recognizing its fluidity: what began as a call to awareness has become a multifaceted ideology, tool for power, and cultural flashpoint.

**Definition and Origins:** The term **‚Äúwoke‚Äù** originated as slang in African-American English, meaning *awake* to social injustice and discrimination„Äê1„Äë„Äê2„Äë. In essence, being ‚Äúwoke‚Äù implies being highly aware of societal issues such as racism, inequality, and other forms of oppression„Äê1„Äë. The related noun **‚Äúwokeness‚Äù** refers to this state of alertness to social problems and injustice„Äê1„Äë. The concept has roots in Black American communities: for example, a 1930s blues song cautioned listeners to ‚Äústay woke‚Äù to the dangers of racist threats, and a 1962 *New York Times* essay by William Melvin Kelley discussed *woke* as an African-American slang term for enlightened awareness„Äê1„Äë„Äê2„Äë. Originally, **woke** simply meant *well-informed* or *up-to-date* ‚Äì the Oxford English Dictionary notes that it *formerly* meant being informed, but **now chiefly** means being ‚Äúalert to racial or social discrimination and injustice‚Äù„Äê1„Äë.  

**Mainstream Popularization:** The concept of being *woke* remained in Black vernacular for decades, but it entered mainstream usage in the 2010s amid rising social justice movements„Äê2„Äë. During the 2014 Ferguson protests and the Black Lives Matter movement, activists urged communities to ‚Äústay woke‚Äù in the face of police brutality and racial inequality„Äê2„Äë. The term spread via social media (notably on Black Twitter) and was adopted by many young Americans as a badge of awareness or allyship with marginalized groups„Äê2„Äë. As usage broadened beyond its original context, *woke* gained recognition in official lexicons ‚Äì by 2017, the term was added to the Oxford English Dictionary, reflecting its new prominence in popular vocabulary„Äê2„Äë. The surge of racial justice protests in 2020 (after George Floyd‚Äôs murder) further propelled ‚Äúwoke‚Äù into global discourse, making it a widely recognized shorthand for consciousness of social inequality„Äê3„Äë.  

**Backlash and Evolving Connotations:** Over time, ‚Äúwoke‚Äù also acquired negative connotations in some quarters. By the late 2010s, conservative and centrist commentators began invoking ‚Äúwoke‚Äù sarcastically or as an insult„Äê2„Äë. In this pejorative sense, *woke* is used to imply someone is overly politically correct or excessively progressive in a way deemed extreme or unreasonable„Äê4„Äë. (*Merriam-Webster*‚Äôs dictionary, for example, notes that **woke**, used disapprovingly, describes a person who is liberal ‚Äúin a way that is considered unreasonable or extreme‚Äù„Äê4„Äë.) In U.S. politics especially, **‚Äúwoke‚Äù** has become a buzzword for right-wing critics to lump together progressive social policies they oppose„Äê3„Äë. Republican politicians now routinely deride ‚Äúwoke‚Äù ideas in education, business, and media ‚Äì Florida‚Äôs governor even enacted a **‚ÄúStop W.O.K.E. Act‚Äù** to restrict what his administration calls ‚Äúwoke indoctrination‚Äù in schools„Äê5„Äë. Analysts point out that this anti-woke rhetoric often serves as a **dog whistle** ‚Äì a coded way to rally opposition to racial and social justice initiatives without explicitly mentioning race„Äê5„Äë. In essence, the term **woke** has been **co-opted** by opponents of progressive change, turning a call for awareness into a catch-all slur against modern left-leaning values„Äê3„Äë.  

**Debate and Usage Today:** Because of these shifts, **‚Äúwokeness‚Äù** has become a contested term with starkly different interpretations. Supporters view wokeness as a positive **awareness** ‚Äì a call to stay mindful of injustice and to advocate for equitable treatment of marginalized groups. In this sense, being *woke* is seen as being enlightened and socially conscious, aligned with ideals of fairness and empathy„Äê1„Äë. However, critics (across the political spectrum) argue that wokeness can veer into performative activism or dogmatism. Right-wing critics often claim ‚Äúwoke culture‚Äù is superficial or divisive, prioritizing symbolic gestures over substance„Äê2„Äë. At the same time, some left-wing or liberal commentators worry that a fixation on identity politics under the *woke* banner undermines broader working-class solidarity and universal humanist values„Äê2„Äë„Äê6„Äë. There is concern that certain ‚Äúwoke‚Äù practices emphasize virtue-signaling and language policing over tangible progress, leading to public fatigue or backlash„Äê6„Äë. Indeed, terms like **‚Äúwoke-washing‚Äù** and **‚Äúwoke capitalism‚Äù** have emerged to accuse corporations of superficially embracing progressive rhetoric for goodwill, rather than implementing real change„Äê2„Äë.  

In summary, **woke** and **wokeness** broadly refer to social awareness and the drive to address injustices. The terms‚Äô meanings have evolved from their origins in Black American slang to become mainstream shorthand for progressive consciousness. Yet today they carry a dual legacy: for many, *wokeness* signifies a laudable vigilance against inequality, while for others ‚Äúwoke‚Äù is used derisively to label something as overly political or extreme. This duality has made *wokeness* a flashpoint in contemporary culture wars ‚Äì encapsulating debates over how society should pursue equality and social change„Äê3„Äë„Äê6„Äë.

# ü§ñ Gemini's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

"Woke" and "wokeness" are complex and highly contested terms whose meanings have evolved significantly over time. Originally a term of empowerment within the African American community, it has since entered mainstream discourse, where it is used both as a positive descriptor for social awareness and as a pejorative term for what critics see as performative or overly dogmatic progressive politics.

### 1. Origins and Original Meaning

The term "woke" originates in African American Vernacular English (AAVE). In its most literal sense, it is the past participle of "wake." However, its figurative meaning‚Äîto be "awake" to social and political issues, particularly racial prejudice and systemic injustice‚Äîhas a long history.

The phrase "stay woke" served as a command and a reminder within the Black community to remain vigilant and aware of the social and political dangers they faced, especially from racial discrimination and violence. While the concept is older, one of the first widely cited uses of the phrase in this context appears in a 1938 recording by the folk singer Lead Belly, who warns Black Americans to "stay woke" when traveling through Alabama [1].

In the 21st century, the term was repopularized by the 2008 song "Master Teacher" by Erykah Badu, which features the refrain "I stay woke" [2]. This helped reintroduce the term to a new generation before its explosion into the mainstream. At this stage, to be "woke" was to be a well-informed, conscious, and vigilant advocate for Black rights and liberation.

### 2. Mainstream Adoption and Black Lives Matter

The term "woke" gained widespread prominence with the rise of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, particularly following the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The hashtag #StayWoke became a digital rallying cry on social media, urging people to remain aware of and engaged with issues of police brutality and systemic racism [2].

During this period, the meaning began to broaden. While still centered on racial justice, being "woke" expanded to encompass a general awareness of other forms of social inequality, including sexism, LGBTQ+ discrimination, and other systemic issues. It functioned as a positive shorthand for being committed to social justice and understanding the structural nature of oppression.

### 3. Pejorative Usage and "Wokeism"

As the term became more mainstream, it was co-opted by political and cultural critics, primarily on the right, and transformed into a pejorative. In this context, "woke" is used to mock or dismiss a wide range of progressive ideas and behaviors. The term "wokeness" is often used to describe this as a rigid and intolerant ideology.

The negative connotations associated with "woke" include:

*   **Performative Activism:** The idea that a person or corporation is publicly adopting "woke" stances for social credit or financial gain without genuine commitment, a practice often called "virtue signaling."
*   **Oversensitivity:** Critics use "woke" to describe what they see as an excessive tendency to take offense, particularly in relation to language and cultural representation. This is often linked to the term "snowflake."
*   **"Cancel Culture":** "Wokeness" is frequently blamed for "cancel culture," the practice of publicly shaming and withdrawing support from individuals or entities after they have said or done something considered offensive.
*   **Illiberalism and Dogma:** Some critics argue that "wokeness" has become an illiberal ideology that is intolerant of dissent, stifles free speech, and promotes a simplistic worldview of oppressors and oppressed [4]. The term "wokeism" is often used to frame it as a quasi-religious, dogmatic belief system.

Today, "woke" is often used as a vague, all-purpose insult for nearly any person, policy, or idea associated with progressive politics, from diversity initiatives in corporations to discussions of gender identity in schools [3].

### 4. Key Concepts Associated with Wokeness

The ideas underlying the positive definition of "wokeness" are drawn from various strains of critical theory and social justice advocacy. Key concepts include:

*   **Systemic Injustice:** The belief that social inequalities (like racism, sexism, and homophobia) are not just the product of individual prejudices but are embedded within the structures, laws, and norms of society.
*   **Intersectionality:** A term coined by legal scholar Kimberl√© Crenshaw, intersectionality is the analytical framework for understanding how a person's overlapping social and political identities (e.g., race, gender, class, sexual orientation) combine to create unique experiences of discrimination and privilege [5]. For example, the experience of a Black woman is distinct from that of a white woman or a Black man.
*   **Privilege:** The concept that certain groups in society have unearned advantages based on their identity (e.g., white privilege, male privilege). Being "woke" involves recognizing one's own privilege and working to dismantle the systems that grant it.

### Conclusion

In summary, "woke" is a term with a dual, and often contradictory, meaning that is highly dependent on the speaker and the context.

1.  **Original and Affirmative Meaning:** Rooted in AAVE, it signifies a deep awareness of systemic injustices, particularly racism, and a commitment to challenging them.
2.  **Pejorative and Critical Meaning:** Used by critics, it describes a perceived form of performative, overly sensitive, and dogmatic progressive politics.

The journey of the word from a specific call for vigilance within the Black community to a broad and contested political label illustrates the complex ways language is shaped by culture, activism, and political conflict.

    *   While not solely about "woke," Mounk's writing here and elsewhere presents a prominent critique of what he considers the "woke worldview." He argues that certain progressive movements have embraced an illiberal set of ideas that are hostile to core democratic values like free speech and individual rights, framing "wokeness" as a rigid ideology that can be counterproductive to its stated goals.

    *   This source features an interview with Kimberl√© Crenshaw, the scholar who coined the term "intersectionality." It provides a direct explanation of the concept from its originator. The perspective is academic and definitional, presenting intersectionality as an essential analytical tool for understanding how overlapping systems of power and discrimination affect individuals with multiple marginalized identities.

### Definition and Origins

The term "woke" is an adjective originating from African American Vernacular English (AAVE), where it initially meant being literally awake or alert. In a socio-political context, it evolved to signify being aware of and attentive to issues of social injustice, particularly racial discrimination and systemic inequalities [1]. The related noun "wokeness" refers to the state, ideology, or cultural phenomenon of embodying this awareness, often encompassing activism against various forms of oppression, including racism, sexism, homophobia, and economic disparity [2].

Historically, the term can be traced back to the 1930s in African American communities. For instance, it appeared in a 1938 protest song by Huddie Ledbetter (Lead Belly) titled "Scottsboro Boys," where he warned Black individuals to "stay woke" to dangers of injustice during the trial of nine Black teenagers falsely accused of rape [3]. The modern usage gained prominence in the 21st century, notably through Erykah Badu's 2008 song "Master Teacher," which includes the refrain "I stay woke," emphasizing vigilance against societal ills [1]. It surged in popularity during the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement around 2014, with phrases like "stay woke" becoming a call to action against police brutality and racial inequality [2].

### Evolution and Broader Usage

Over time, "woke" has broadened beyond racial justice to include awareness of other progressive causes, such as environmental issues, gender equality, and LGBTQ+ rights. In positive contexts, being woke is seen as a virtue: it encourages empathy, education, and advocacy for marginalized groups, fostering a more equitable society [4]. For example, corporations and institutions have adopted "woke" branding in diversity initiatives, such as inclusive hiring practices or campaigns supporting social causes [2].

However, the term has also become polarized. In the 2010s and 2020s, critics‚Äîoften from conservative viewpoints‚Äîhave repurposed "woke" and "wokeness" pejoratively to describe what they perceive as excessive political correctness, performative activism, or an overreach of progressive ideologies that stifle free speech or impose "cancel culture" [5]. This shift is evident in political discourse, where figures like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have used "woke" as a shorthand for opposing certain educational curricula on race and gender [5]. Linguists note that this evolution reflects a common pattern where terms from marginalized communities are co-opted and redefined in mainstream culture [1].

### Key Characteristics and Criticisms

Wokeness is often characterized by:
- **Awareness and Education**: Encouraging individuals to recognize implicit biases and historical contexts of oppression [4].
- **Activism**: Promoting actions like protests, policy changes, or boycotts to address inequalities [2].
- **Intersectionality**: Understanding how different forms of discrimination overlap, a concept popularized by scholar Kimberl√© Crenshaw [3].

Criticisms include accusations that wokeness can lead to divisiveness, where disagreement is equated with bigotry, or that it prioritizes symbolism over substantive change (e.g., "virtue signaling") [5]. Supporters counter that such critiques often dismiss legitimate calls for justice and serve to maintain the status quo [4]. The term's meaning continues to evolve, influenced by social media, where it can be both a badge of honor and a target for satire [1].

In summary, "woke" and "wokeness" represent a dynamic concept rooted in social awareness but subject to varying interpretations based on cultural and political lenses. Its usage highlights ongoing debates about progress, identity, and power in society.
