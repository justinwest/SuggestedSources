# 🤖 ChatGPT's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

The term **“woke” ideology** generally refers to a set of progressive beliefs centered on social justice and awareness of systemic inequalities. In its original sense, “woke” meant being consciously alert to racial or social injustices – one dictionary defines it as *“having or marked by an active awareness of systemic injustices and prejudices, especially those involving the treatment of ethnic, racial, or sexual minorities”* [1]. The term originated in African American communities in the early 20th century, where to “stay woke” meant remaining vigilant to racial oppression and injustice [2]. For example, a 1930s blues song by Lead Belly used the phrase “stay woke” to warn Black Americans about the threat of racist violence [2]. 

**Evolution into a Broader Movement:** The concept of *“being woke”* regained prominence during the 2010s, especially with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014 ([abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/woke-conservatives/story?id=93051138#:~:text=The%20term%2C%20in%20one%20of,police%20shooting%20of%20Michael%20Brown)). It expanded beyond racial issues to encompass awareness of all forms of social inequality, including gender discrimination, LGBTQ+ rights, and economic injustice. Thus, *“woke ideology”* in modern usage refers to a broad left-wing worldview that seeks to identify and address systemic injustices in society. Journalist Zaid Jilani, for instance, explains that a woke person is *“constantly inspecting every institution in society, looking for the presence of racism, sexism, and other forms of pervasive prejudice.”* [3] In this view, being woke implies not just awareness but a **commitment to social change**. Supporters of woke ideology see it as a positive consciousness-raising. They argue that “waking up” to historical and ongoing oppression is a necessary first step toward empowering marginalized groups and achieving meaningful change [4]. Indeed, Black activists have long used the admonition *“stay woke”* as a call for solidarity and vigilance in the face of injustice [4]. 

**Negative Connotations and Criticisms:** In recent years, however, “woke” has also taken on negative connotations in the political arena. The definition of *“woke”* now often **depends on who you ask** [2]. Conservative critics have co-opted “woke” as a catch-all label for what they perceive as an overzealous or coercive progressive ideology. In this pejorative sense, *“woke ideology”* is used to mock or criticize left-wing social justice activism and what opponents see as an imposed *“liberal orthodoxy”* [1]. For example, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has railed against “woke ideology,” defining it as *“the belief there are systemic injustices in American society and the need to address them”* – a belief he pledges to “never surrender” to ([abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/woke-conservatives/story?id=93051138#:~:text=Woke%20is%20defined%20by%20the,reported%20by%20The%20Washington%20Post)). Critics often argue that woke ideology demands rigid conformity of thought and frames issues in absolute moral terms. Zaid Jilani contends that it fosters an almost **“you’re either with us or against us”** mentality, pushing a fervent activism that insists everyone must publicly embrace its social causes [3]. He notes that, unlike traditional liberals, many “woke” advocates put less emphasis on neutral principles like free speech if those conflict with their equity goals ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=Unlike%20traditional%20liberals%2C%20woke%20Americans,you%20are%20with%20the%20terrorists%E2%80%9D)). As an illustration, anti-racism author Ibram X. Kendi – a popular voice in woke circles – has written that *“the only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination,”* implying that affirmative action or similar measures are required to correct historical wrongs ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=Unlike%20traditional%20liberals%2C%20woke%20Americans,you%20are%20with%20the%20terrorists%E2%80%9D)). Detractors say this *ends-justify-the-means* approach exemplifies what they dislike about woke ideology [3]. 

Some skeptics go so far as to liken “wokeness” to a new **secular religion**, complete with its own dogmas and zeal. Linguist John McWhorter, for example, argues that the modern “woke” movement functions like a religious cult, with adherents zealously policing heresy and purity. In his view, this ideology harbors rigid doctrines about racism and virtue, and it ultimately *“reinforces racism rather than combating it,”* by reducing everything to racial identity in a moral absolutist way [5]. Such critics believe that woke ideology can be intolerant of dissenting viewpoints and prone to performative gestures (or *“virtue signaling”*) instead of practical solutions – often punishing those who don’t vocally adhere to its tenets. They point to phenomena like social media “cancel culture” as evidence of a quasi-religious fervor to purge unbelievers. 

**Debate Over Meaning:** Because the term *“woke”* is used so broadly, it has become a **contested and ambiguous label** in culture-war debates. Even some progressives note that the word has been overused and misappropriated outside its original context. Terms that began in Black activist slang have often been *“co-opted and distorted beyond recognition”* once they enter mainstream discourse, one commentator argues [6]. In other words, when people today deride “woke ideology,” they may be attacking a caricature that bears little resemblance to what its originators intended ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=Malaika%20Jabali%3A%20%E2%80%98Woke%20has%20become,distorted%20beyond%20recognition%E2%80%99)). Meanwhile, others argue that the core values behind being *woke* – empathy for the oppressed and a desire to fix unfair systems – are being lost in the polarized backlash. 

In summary, **“woke ideology”** originally signified alertness to societal injustices and a willingness to fight for equality, but it has evolved into a polarizing shorthand. To its proponents, it means heightened awareness and progress toward justice; to its opponents, it implies an aggressive, misguided dogma. The phrase has essentially become a battlefield of definitions, with each side assigning it either a virtuous or a derisive meaning. Understanding what *“woke”* ideology **is** therefore requires understanding **who is using the term, and in what context** [2][6].

# 🤖 Gemini's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

"Woke" is a complex and contested term that originally comes from African American Vernacular English (AAVE), where it meant being alert to systemic injustice, particularly racism [1, 7]. Over the past decade, its meaning has evolved and expanded. It is now commonly used to describe a specific, left-leaning ideology focused on identity, power dynamics, and social justice. This ideology is characterized by a set of core beliefs and has been explained through several distinct theories regarding its origins and function [2, 3].

### Core Tenets of Woke Ideology

According to the provided sources, the ideology often labeled as "woke" is built on several key pillars:

1.  **A Worldview of Oppression:** A central belief is that society is not a community of individuals but a web of power structures and systems. These systems create a hierarchy where groups are defined as either "oppressors" or "the oppressed" based on identity markers like race, gender, sexuality, and class [1]. This framework is heavily influenced by Critical Theory, which analyzes society through the lens of power [1].
2.  **The Primacy of Group Identity:** The ideology prioritizes group identity over individual identity and universal human values. An individual's primary essence is seen through the lens of the identity groups to which they belong [1, 6].
3.  **Social Constructionism:** A key tenet is that many aspects of human life and identity—including gender, race, and social norms—are "socially constructed." This means they are not based on objective reality or biology but are created and enforced by dominant groups to maintain power [1].
4.  **Knowledge as Subjective ("Standpoint Epistemology"):** The ideology often values "lived experience" as a primary source of knowledge and truth, particularly the experiences of those from marginalized groups. This concept, known as standpoint epistemology, posits that oppressed groups have a special insight into the nature of their oppression that members of oppressor groups cannot access [1].
5.  **The Role of Language:** Language is not seen as a neutral tool for communication but as an active force that shapes reality and reinforces power structures. This belief underpins the focus on policing language, using specific terminology (e.g., "Latinx," "BIPOC"), and identifying "problematic" speech [1, 7].

### Theories on the Origin and Function

Analysts have proposed several distinct, sometimes overlapping, theories to explain where "woke" ideology came from and what purpose it serves in society.

*   **A Secularized Religion:** One prominent theory, articulated by Curtis Yarvin, posits that wokeness is the modern, secularized evolution of American mainline Protestantism. As traditional religious belief declined among educated elites, the moral fervor, focus on sin (privilege), and missionary zeal to reform society were transferred to a new, secular belief system. In this view, universities, media, and HR departments function as the new "Cathedral" or church, propagating the doctrine [3].
*   **An Ideology for the Managerial Elite:** N.S. Lyons argues that "woke" functions as a "managerial ideology." It provides a moral framework for the professional-managerial class (academics, HR professionals, government bureaucrats, corporate leaders) to manage an increasingly diverse and fragmented society. By focusing on therapeutic language and identity-based recognition, it serves as a tool to maintain social control and legitimize the authority of this elite class, all while avoiding more challenging economic questions [2].
*   **A Product of Affluence and Status Seeking:** Other analysts connect the rise of this ideology to unprecedented wealth and safety in Western societies. Michael Makovi suggests it is a "post-scarcity" phenomenon; with their basic material needs met, educated elites turn to satisfying higher-level psychological needs, such as the pursuit of moral status [5]. Musa al-Gharbi similarly identifies many "woke" positions as "luxury beliefs"—ideas that confer status on the upper class while often inflicting costs on lower classes [4].
*   **An Intellectual Successor to Marxism and Postmodernism:** Steve Stewart-Williams traces the intellectual lineage of wokeness through several historical philosophical movements. He argues it inherits its focus on group struggle from Marxism (substituting identity for class), its skepticism of objective truth from Postmodernism (Foucault, Derrida), and its belief in the malleability of human nature from "blank slate" theories popularized by thinkers like Rousseau [1].
*   **A Conformity Cascade:** From a social-psychological perspective, Paul Graham describes wokeness as a powerful force for conformity. In environments where these ideas are dominant (like universities and tech companies), there is immense pressure to adopt the correct views and language to signal goodness and, crucially, to avoid being targeted and ostracized. This creates a cascade where people conform out of a desire for social acceptance or fear of social and professional consequences, regardless of their private beliefs [7].

In summary, "woke" ideology is understood as a belief system centered on identity-based power structures and the deconstruction of traditional norms. Its emergence is explained by a convergence of factors: the evolution of specific intellectual traditions, the secularization of religious impulses, the social-management needs of an elite class, and psychological dynamics of status-seeking and conformity in a wealthy society [1, 2, 3, 5, 7].

# 🤖 Grok's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

"Woke" ideology, often simply referred to as "wokeness," is a multifaceted and contested term that has evolved significantly in recent years. Originally emerging from African American Vernacular English in the early 20th century, "woke" meant staying alert to social injustices, particularly racial discrimination [8]. In contemporary usage, it has broadened to encompass a progressive worldview emphasizing awareness of systemic inequalities related to race, gender, sexuality, and other identity markers. However, it is frequently used pejoratively by critics to describe an overzealous or authoritarian form of social justice activism that prioritizes identity politics, political correctness, and institutional reforms [1][7]. This response synthesizes insights from the suggested sources, which trace its origins, cultural drivers, and ideological functions, while incorporating additional references for a balanced overview.

### Definition and Core Elements
At its core, wokeness involves a heightened sensitivity to oppression and a commitment to dismantling structures perceived as perpetuating inequality. Key elements include:
- **Awareness of Systemic Injustices**: Drawing from critical race theory and intersectionality, it posits that societal systems (e.g., capitalism, patriarchy, colonialism) inherently favor dominant groups (e.g., white, male, heterosexual individuals) and marginalize others [1][4]. For instance, it critiques "white privilege" and calls for equity over equality [8].
- **Identity Politics**: Emphasis on group identities as central to understanding power dynamics, often advocating for affirmative action, diversity initiatives, and representation in media and institutions [2][5].
- **Cultural and Linguistic Norms**: Promotion of inclusive language (e.g., gender-neutral pronouns), cancellation of offensive content or figures, and "safe spaces" to protect marginalized voices [7].
- **Activism and Reform**: It manifests in movements like Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, and environmental justice, pushing for policy changes in education, workplaces, and governance [3][6].

Critics argue that wokeness has morphed into an ideology that enforces conformity, stifles free speech, and creates new hierarchies based on victimhood status [1][7]. Paul Graham, for example, describes it as a "heresy hunt" where deviation from progressive orthodoxy invites social punishment [7].

### Origins and Historical Development
The roots of wokeness are debated, with sources linking it to a blend of intellectual, social, and institutional trends:
- **Intellectual Foundations**: Many trace it to mid-20th-century postmodernism and critical theory, influenced by thinkers like Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida, who questioned objective truth and emphasized power structures. This evolved through academic fields like gender studies and postcolonial theory in the 1960s–1990s [1][5]. Steve Stewart Williams highlights how these ideas spread from universities into broader culture via social media and activism [1].
- **Social and Cultural Trends**: Post-1960s civil rights movements, feminism, and LGBTQ+ advocacy laid the groundwork. Economic shifts, such as rising inequality and the decline of traditional industries, fueled a sense of precarity that amplified identity-based grievances [5]. Michael Lind argues that wokeness arose from broader trends like urbanization, secularization, and the rise of knowledge economies, which empowered educated elites to champion social justice [5].
- **Institutional and Managerial Aspects**: Some view wokeness as a tool of elite management. Bo Winegard posits it as a "managerial ideology" that helps corporations and institutions navigate diversity while maintaining control, often through HR policies and DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) programs [2]. Curtis Yarvin traces it to historical American progressivism, likening it to a modern Puritanism rooted in 19th-century abolitionism and evolving into a state-sponsored ideology [3].
- **Elite Contradictions**: Musa al-Gharbi notes the irony that wokeness is often driven by affluent, educated progressives who benefit from the systems they critique, creating cultural contradictions [4]. Nathan Cofnas extends this by arguing that the political right has inadvertently contributed to wokeness through its own identity politics and anti-establishment rhetoric [6].

The term gained mainstream traction in the 2010s, amplified by social media platforms that rewarded viral outrage and echo chambers [1][7]. Events like the 2014 Ferguson protests popularized "stay woke" as a call to action against police brutality [8].

### Criticisms and Variations
Wokeness is not monolithic; it varies by context. In the U.S., it's tied to Democratic politics, while globally, similar ideas appear in anti-colonial movements [9]. Critics from the left argue it distracts from class-based issues, while right-leaning voices see it as cultural Marxism or reverse discrimination [6][10]. Proponents defend it as essential for progress, countering that anti-woke sentiments often mask bigotry [8].

Empirical studies suggest wokeness correlates with higher education and urban living, but it's not universally embraced even among progressives [4]. Its pejorative use surged around 2017, often as a catch-all for any left-leaning view [7].

In summary, wokeness represents a evolving ideology focused on social justice through the lens of identity and power, with origins in academia and activism. While it drives positive change for some, others see it as divisive or elitist. Understanding it requires recognizing both its aspirational goals and the debates it provokes.

**“Woke” ideology** generally refers to a set of beliefs centered around awareness of social injustices and a commitment to addressing systemic inequalities. The term “woke” originally emerged in African American slang, meaning alertness to racism and social injustice ([www.merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/woke-meaning-origin#:~:text=,leaning)). Merriam-Webster defines *woke* as being “aware of and actively attentive to important facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice),” noting the word gained wider use during the Black Lives Matter movement in the 2010s ([www.merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/woke-meaning-origin#:~:text=,leaning)). In this original sense, to be woke was a positive description—essentially being socially conscious and informed about inequality. 

As an ideology, *woke* encompasses progressive values and advocacy for marginalized groups. It is rooted in the belief that systemic injustices (such as racism, sexism, or other forms of discrimination) exist in society and must be actively identified and remedied. One commentator describes *woke* as a modern left-wing political ideology focused on recognizing and fighting structural inequalities ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=The%20word%20woke%20loosely%20refers,other%20forms%20of%20pervasive%20prejudice)). A woke perspective emphasizes issues like racial equity, gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and other social justice causes. For example, someone who is *woke* is highly attuned to instances of prejudice or privilege—they strive to “stay awake” to unfairness in institutions and everyday life and push for changes that promote equity and inclusion ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=The%20word%20woke%20loosely%20refers,other%20forms%20of%20pervasive%20prejudice)). This often involves challenging established power structures, calling out discriminatory behavior (even when subtle), and championing policies or cultural shifts that support historically disadvantaged groups. 

The meaning and connotation of *“woke”* have evolved and now vary greatly depending on who is using the term ([abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/woke-conservatives/story?id=93051138#:~:text=The%20definition%20of%20,depending%20on%20who%20you%20ask)). Many progressives and social justice advocates still use *woke* in a positive way, as a badge of awareness and empathy toward societal injustices. In its early usage, *woke* was indeed a proud expression of having *awakened* to injustice – for example, writer Rebecca Solnit notes that the word described “the quality of having awakened, especially to injustice and racism” among Black Americans before it entered mainstream use ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=Once%20upon%20a%20time%2C%20the,Woke%20was%20such%20a%20word)). To supporters, embracing woke ideals means being conscious of historical and ongoing oppression and working to **make society more fair and inclusive**. However, in today’s political discourse, *“woke”* is often used with negative overtones—especially by some conservatives who apply it as an umbrella term for a wide range of progressive values they criticize ([abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/woke-conservatives/story?id=93051138#:~:text=The%20term%20has%20recently%20been,using%20it%20with%20negative%20connotations)). In this context, “woke ideology” is portrayed as a caricature of far-left politics or *social engineering*. Critics use *woke* as a catch-all label for what they deem excessive political correctness or extreme identity-based politics. The term gets invoked in debates over issues like school curricula, corporate diversity programs, gender-neutral language, and more. For instance, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has explicitly declared “we reject woke ideology” as a rallying cry, while pursuing policies to limit what he views as *“woke”* influences in education and government ([abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/woke-conservatives/story?id=93051138#:~:text=gubernatorial%20candidate%20Rep,8%2C%202022%2C%20in%20Tampa%2C%20Fla)). In such usages, *woke* becomes a pejorative shorthand, signaling a broad rejection of modern progressive social change. 

**Critiques and Controversies:** Those who criticize *woke ideology* argue that it can be dogmatic or divisive. Conservative commentators often claim that *woke* activists prioritize group identities and differences over shared national values or individual merit. British author Douglas Murray, for example, describes *“wokeness”* as a tyrannical mindset that elevates racial, gender, and sexual identities above our common humanity ([www.rnz.co.nz](https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/saturday/audio/2018726945/douglas-murray-the-groupthink-tyranny-of-woke#:~:text=Divided%20by%20our%20race%2C%20gender,higher%20priority%20than%20our%20sameness)). Detractors frequently associate *woke* ideas with concepts like *cancel culture*, *radical identity politics*, and extreme *political correctness*, suggesting that this ideology pressures people to conform to a left-wing viewpoint and ostracizes those who dissent ([en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org](https://en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org/wiki/Woke#:~:text=Both%20the%20word%20woke%20and,that%20the%20concept%20of%20being)). They point to instances where zealous “woke” activism – in their view – has led to public shaming, censorship, or the loss of livelihoods for individuals deemed insufficiently progressive. Some critics also argue that *woke* practices can be performative or lacking in substance: for example, focusing on symbolic gestures and language changes rather than practical solutions. Even a few liberal and center-left voices have cautioned that certain “woke” behaviors (such as jargon-heavy or moralizing language) may alienate potential allies or distract from concrete policy goals. This perspective holds that an overly rigid commitment to woke ideals can sometimes backfire, creating culture-war flashpoints instead of consensus. 

**Supporters’ Perspective:** On the other hand, supporters of what is often called *woke ideology* emphasize that being *woke* simply means striving for a more just, equal society. From this viewpoint, *wokeness* is about compassion, inclusion, and a willingness to question the status quo in order to help disadvantaged groups. Advocates see the term’s origins as a call to *stay alert* to injustice – a reminder not to ignore racism, inequality, or other social ills. They often view the backlash against “woke” as disproportionate or in bad faith. Deriding something as *“woke”*, in their view, has become a way to dismiss or belittle sincere efforts to address discrimination. Rebecca Solnit, for instance, argues that the term *woke* was **“kidnapped”** by its opponents – turned into a caricature or *“zombie”* term used to sneer at people who are concerned about racism and other injustices ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=Once%20upon%20a%20time%2C%20the,Woke%20was%20such%20a%20word)). In other words, many who believe in the core ideals behind *woke* feel that the word itself has been twisted and weaponized, even as the underlying goals of equity and awareness remain worthy. To its proponents, *woke ideology* represents a continued push for societal progress – expanding civil rights, educating about biases, and holding powerful institutions accountable – and the hostility toward the word *woke* says more about resistance to change than about the ideals themselves. 

In summary, **“woke ideology”** refers to a broad framework of social consciousness that urges people to recognize and confront injustice. It aligns with progressive, inclusive values – challenging racism, sexism, and other inequities – and encourages constant awareness of how these issues pervade society. At the same time, the term *“woke”* has become highly polarized in modern discourse. Depending on the context, calling something *woke* might be meant as praise for its social awareness or, conversely, as an insult implying overzealous or misguided activism. The definition *“changes depending on who you ask,”* as one news report observes ([abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/woke-conservatives/story?id=93051138#:~:text=The%20definition%20of%20,depending%20on%20who%20you%20ask)). To some, *woke* is a positive ethos of empathy and enlightenment; to others, it has become a catch-all epithet for a perceived extreme progressive orthodoxy. Understanding *woke ideology* today thus requires recognizing both its origin as a rallying cry for justice and the divergent reactions it provokes in the ongoing culture wars.

**Sources:**

1. **Merriam-Webster Dictionary** – *Definition and origin of “woke.”* Merriam-Webster notes that *woke* means being aware of important social issues (especially racial and social justice). The term originated in African American English and entered mainstream usage around the mid-2010s. By the end of that decade it had also started to be used pejoratively, as a general insult for anyone perceived as politically left-leaning ([www.merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/woke-meaning-origin#:~:text=,leaning)).

2. **Zaid Jilani (The Guardian)** – *Description of woke as a modern left-wing ideology.* Jilani, writing in *The Guardian*, explains that *“woke”* refers to a social-media-fueled leftist political ideology that emerged in the early 2010s. The term derives from the idea of being **awake** to structural inequalities in society and hyper-aware of one’s own role in those injustices. According to Jilani, someone who is woke is constantly scrutinizing institutions for the presence of racism, sexism, and other pervasive prejudices. What separates a woke person from a more traditional progressive, he argues, is a fervent insistence that everyone must be enlisted in these social causes at all times, and a belief that fighting injustice may justify pushing past conventional norms (for example, placing *equity* outcomes above absolute free-speech neutrality) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=The%20word%20woke%20loosely%20refers,other%20forms%20of%20pervasive%20prejudice)) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=enlisted%20into%20their%20social%20causes,the%20means%20when%20battling%20injustice)).

3. **Kiara Alfonseca (ABC News)** – *How the term’s meaning shifts between communities.* Alfonseca’s reporting for ABC News emphasizes that the definition of “woke” often *“changes depending on who you ask.”* In recent years, conservative politicians and media have co-opted *woke* as an umbrella label for progressive values and initiatives – typically applying the term with negative connotations ([abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/woke-conservatives/story?id=93051138#:~:text=The%20term%20has%20recently%20been,using%20it%20with%20negative%20connotations)). By contrast, the word *woke* was originally popularized by progressive Black Americans in the mid-20th century and meant being informed and conscious of racial injustices. (For instance, *Merriam-Webster* records that to be “woke” in Black communities meant someone was educated and aware of social inequality ([abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/woke-conservatives/story?id=93051138#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20term%20was%20originally,1900s)).) Alfonseca notes that Florida’s Governor, Ron DeSantis, even formally defined **“woke ideology”** as the belief there are systemic injustices in society that need to be addressed – a definition he then explicitly rejected while campaigning against what he called *“woke”* influence in schools and government ([abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/woke-conservatives/story?id=93051138#:~:text=gubernatorial%20candidate%20Rep,8%2C%202022%2C%20in%20Tampa%2C%20Fla)).

4. **Rebecca Solnit (The Guardian)** – *Progressive view on the misuse of “woke.”* Solnit, a progressive author and Guardian columnist, recounts that *woke* once straightforwardly meant having *awakened* to injustice and racism. The slang’s early life was nurtured in Black American communities as a call to awareness. However, Solnit argues that the term was later **“kidnapped”** by its foes – “old white conservatives” who turned *woke* into a derisive buzzword. Rather than allow the concept to thrive, she says, opponents wielded *“woke”* as a weapon, sending the word out as a “zombie mercenary” to *“sneer at those who were concerned about racism and other injustices.”* In her view, this cynical distortion robbed the term of its original meaning and effectively killed its usefulness – a fate that left its original users indifferent (or even glad) to abandon the word ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=Once%20upon%20a%20time%2C%20the,Woke%20was%20such%20a%20word)) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=zombie%20mercenary%20sent%20out%20to,The%20end)).

According to Murray, *wokeness* entails obsessing over identity categories – dividing people by race, gender, and sexual orientation – and giving those differences priority over shared humanity and unity. He characterizes this mindset as **tyrannical**, suggesting that it forces society into factions and silos. Murray’s perspective is that *woke* activists demand strict adherence to their views on gender, race, and identity, stifling open debate; he warns that such *woke* groupthink undermines social cohesion and free expression ([www.rnz.co.nz](https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/saturday/audio/2018726945/douglas-murray-the-groupthink-tyranny-of-woke#:~:text=Divided%20by%20our%20race%2C%20gender,higher%20priority%20than%20our%20sameness)).

6. **Various Commentators (Summarized in Wikipedia)** – *“Woke” as a pejorative and culture-war term.* Analyses compiled on Wikipedia note that over time *woke* (and *wokeness*) have increasingly been used in a derogatory sense. Commentators across the political spectrum have observed that *“woke”* became a loaded label often synonymous with extreme *identity politics*, *cancel culture*, or *virtue signaling* ([en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org](https://en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org/wiki/Woke#:~:text=Both%20the%20word%20woke%20and,that%20the%20concept%20of%20being)). In public discourse, especially on the right, the term is frequently deployed as a catch-all shorthand for progressive changes that critics view as overzealous or absurd. This reflects how a word that began as an empowering call to awareness has been transformed, in some quarters, into a punchline or political grenade in the broader culture wars.


# 🤖 Gemini's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

The term "woke" refers to a complex and highly contested set of ideas centered on social and political justice. Its meaning has evolved significantly, from a term of affirmation within the African American community to a polarizing label in broader political discourse. Originally, being "woke" meant being alert to systemic injustices, particularly racism [1, 2]. Today, the term is often used, especially by critics, to describe a broader, more dogmatic political ideology associated with the progressive left.

### 1. Historical Origins and Evolution

The term's roots are in African American Vernacular English (AAVE). While early uses have been traced back to the 1920s, its modern usage began to take shape in the mid-20th century. In a 1962 *New York Times* article titled "If You’re Woke You Dig It," novelist William Melvin Kelley defined the term as being aware and in-the-know [2].

The term gained significant traction in the 21st century. In her 2008 song "Master Teacher," singer Erykah Badu repeats the phrase "I stay woke," solidifying its connection to social and spiritual consciousness [3]. The phrase became a watchword for activists during the Black Lives Matter movement, starting around 2014. In this context, "stay woke" was a call to remain vigilant against police brutality and systemic racism [1].

By the late 2010s, the term was co-opted and began to be used more broadly, and often pejoratively, by political commentators and politicians. It transformed from a specific call for awareness of racial injustice into a catch-all term for a range of progressive views that critics find extreme or performative [2, 4].

### 2. Core Tenets of the "Woke" Worldview

While not a formal, unified doctrine, the set of ideas often labeled "woke ideology" is drawn from various academic fields like critical theory, post-colonial theory, and gender studies. Proponents see these ideas as essential tools for identifying and dismantling systems of oppression. The core tenets include:

*   **Systemic Injustice:** The central belief is that societal problems like racism, sexism, and homophobia are not merely the product of individual prejudice. Instead, they are *systemic*—embedded within institutions, laws, cultural norms, and power structures that grant advantages to dominant groups while disadvantaging marginalized ones [5]. For example, the focus is not just on a single racist person, but on how housing policies, hiring practices, and the justice system can produce racially disparate outcomes regardless of individual intent.
*   **Intersectionality:** Coined by legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, this concept holds that different aspects of a person's identity (e.g., race, gender, class, sexual orientation, disability) can overlap to create unique, compounded experiences of discrimination or privilege [6]. For example, the experience of a Black woman is distinct from that of a white woman or a Black man because she faces a unique combination of racism and sexism. This framework is used to analyze how power structures affect people differently based on their intersecting identities.
*   **Power Dynamics and Privilege:** Society is viewed as a complex web of power relationships between dominant and marginalized groups (e.g., white/people of color, men/women, cisgender/transgender, able-bodied/disabled). The concept of "privilege" refers to the unearned social, economic, and political advantages that members of a dominant group benefit from, often without realizing it [7]. Acknowledging one's privilege is seen as a crucial step toward understanding and challenging inequality.
*   **The Importance of Language and Representation:** Language is not seen as neutral but as a tool that can either reinforce or challenge oppressive structures. This leads to an emphasis on using inclusive language (e.g., using preferred pronouns, avoiding ableist terms) and creating trigger warnings to alert people to potentially distressing content [4]. Similarly, representation in media, politics, and culture is considered vital for validating marginalized identities and challenging stereotypes.
*   **Re-examination of History and Knowledge:** This worldview advocates for critically re-examining traditional historical narratives, which are often seen as written from the perspective of the powerful. It seeks to uncover and center the stories and contributions of marginalized groups. Efforts like *The New York Times*'s 1619 Project, which reframes American history around the consequences of slavery, are prominent examples of this principle in action [8].

### 3. Critical Perspectives

As the term "woke" became mainstream, it attracted significant criticism from across the political spectrum, though most forcefully from the center and right. Critics argue that these ideas, taken together, have become an illiberal and divisive ideology. Key criticisms include:

*   **Divisiveness and Identity Politics:** Critics contend that the intense focus on group identity fosters a divisive "oppressor vs. oppressed" narrative, pitting groups against each other. They argue it moves away from the ideal of a common humanity and the individual-focused principles of classical liberalism, instead judging individuals primarily by their group identity [9].
*   **Illiberalism and Intolerance to Dissent:** A major criticism is that this ideology is hostile to free speech and open inquiry. Proponents are often accused of engaging in "cancel culture"—the practice of de-platforming or professionally shunning individuals who express dissenting or controversial opinions. Critics argue this creates a climate of fear where people are afraid to ask questions or challenge prevailing orthodoxies, thus stifling debate [10].
*   **Oversimplification and Reductionism:** Some argue that this worldview reduces complex human interactions and societal problems to simple power dynamics. History, culture, and individual agency are sometimes viewed solely through the lens of oppression, which can be a crude and inaccurate way to understand the world [9].
*   **Performative Activism ("Virtue Signaling"):** Critics also point to the performative nature of some "woke" expressions. "Virtue signaling" is the practice of expressing opinions or taking actions intended to demonstrate one's moral correctness to others, without necessarily leading to meaningful change. This can be seen in corporate diversity statements or social media activism that is seen as shallow [4].
*   **Rejection of Objectivity:** Some critics trace the intellectual roots of these ideas to postmodernism, arguing that it can lead to a rejection of objective truth in favor of "lived experience." In this view, one's identity determines one's truth, and claims to objectivity are dismissed as tools of the powerful to maintain their dominance [11].

In conclusion, "woke" is a term with a dual identity. It began as a positive term for awareness of racial injustice within Black culture. However, it has been transformed into a contentious label used to describe (and often criticize) a cluster of progressive ideas about power, identity, and justice. While its proponents see these ideas as necessary for creating a more equitable society, its critics view them as a divisive and illiberal ideology that threatens foundational principles like free expression and individualism.

# 🤖 Grok's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

"Woke" ideology refers to a social and political awareness centered on issues of racial injustice, systemic inequality, and social justice, particularly in the context of marginalized groups. The term "woke" originated in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) as a slang expression meaning to stay alert to social injustices, especially racism [1]. It gained broader prominence in the 2010s through movements like Black Lives Matter, evolving into a broader ideology that encompasses awareness of and activism against various forms of oppression, including those related to gender, sexuality, class, and environmental issues [2]. Proponents view it as a call to action for equity and inclusion, while critics often portray it as an overreaching or divisive form of political correctness that stifles free speech and promotes identity politics [3].

### Origins and Historical Context
The concept of being "woke" traces back to the 1930s, with early usage in African American communities. For instance, it appeared in a 1938 protest song by Lead Belly titled "Scottsboro Boys," where he urged Black people to "stay woke" to the dangers of racial injustice [1]. The term resurfaced prominently in the 21st century, particularly after the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, which sparked the Black Lives Matter movement. Activists used "stay woke" to encourage vigilance against police brutality and systemic racism [2]. By the mid-2010s, it had expanded beyond racial issues to include feminist, LGBTQ+, and anti-capitalist critiques, often associated with progressive politics in the United States and other Western countries [4].

### Key Principles and Components
At its core, woke ideology emphasizes:
- **Awareness of Systemic Oppression**: It posits that societal structures, such as capitalism, patriarchy, and white supremacy, perpetuate inequalities. Adherents advocate for "intersectionality," a framework coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, which examines how overlapping identities (e.g., race, gender, class) compound discrimination [2].
- **Social Justice Activism**: This includes calls for reforms like defunding the police, affirmative action, gender-neutral language, and corporate diversity initiatives. It often involves "cancel culture," where individuals or entities are publicly shamed or boycotted for perceived offenses [3].
- **Cultural and Linguistic Sensitivity**: Woke ideology promotes inclusive language (e.g., using "Latinx" instead of "Latino" to be gender-neutral) and challenges cultural appropriation, microaggressions, and historical narratives that marginalize non-dominant groups [4].
- **Critique of Power Structures**: It draws from critical theory, including influences from Marxism and postcolonial studies, arguing that neutrality in the face of injustice upholds the status quo [2].

Supporters argue that woke ideology fosters empathy and progress toward a more equitable society, citing achievements like increased representation in media and policy changes addressing inequality [1]. For example, the #MeToo movement, often linked to woke principles, has led to greater accountability for sexual harassment [4].

### Criticisms and Controversies
Critics, particularly from conservative and centrist perspectives, contend that woke ideology has become dogmatic and intolerant. They describe it as "wokeism" or "woke capitalism," where corporations superficially adopt progressive stances for profit without substantive change [3]. Detractors like linguist John McWhorter argue it functions as a "religion" that prioritizes moral purity over practical solutions, potentially alienating allies and exacerbating divisions [3]. In the UK and US, political figures have weaponized the term in culture wars, with laws in some US states restricting teachings on systemic racism in schools under the guise of combating "woke indoctrination" [4]. Additionally, some critics highlight instances where woke activism leads to overreach, such as censorship or job losses over minor infractions [3].

The term "woke" itself has become polarized: Originally empowering, it is now often used pejoratively by opponents to dismiss progressive views, while some on the left have distanced themselves from it due to its co-optation [2].

### Evolution and Global Impact
Woke ideology has spread globally, influencing debates in Europe, Australia, and beyond. In France, for instance, President Emmanuel Macron has criticized "American wokeism" as a threat to republican values [4]. Its evolution reflects broader shifts in digital activism, where social media amplifies calls for justice but also enables backlash [1]. While not a monolithic ideology—lacking a single manifesto or leader—it represents a cultural shift toward heightened social consciousness, though its future remains contested amid ongoing political polarization [3].

In summary, "woke" ideology is a fluid, evolving framework for addressing social injustices, rooted in anti-racism but expansive in scope. Its interpretation varies widely, from a vital tool for change to a problematic overcorrection, depending on one's perspective.
