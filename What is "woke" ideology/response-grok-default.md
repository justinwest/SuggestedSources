"Woke" ideology refers to a social and political awareness centered on issues of racial injustice, systemic inequality, and social justice, particularly in the context of marginalized groups. The term "woke" originated in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) as a slang expression meaning to stay alert to social injustices, especially racism [1]. It gained broader prominence in the 2010s through movements like Black Lives Matter, evolving into a broader ideology that encompasses awareness of and activism against various forms of oppression, including those related to gender, sexuality, class, and environmental issues [2]. Proponents view it as a call to action for equity and inclusion, while critics often portray it as an overreaching or divisive form of political correctness that stifles free speech and promotes identity politics [3].

### Origins and Historical Context
The concept of being "woke" traces back to the 1930s, with early usage in African American communities. For instance, it appeared in a 1938 protest song by Lead Belly titled "Scottsboro Boys," where he urged Black people to "stay woke" to the dangers of racial injustice [1]. The term resurfaced prominently in the 21st century, particularly after the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, which sparked the Black Lives Matter movement. Activists used "stay woke" to encourage vigilance against police brutality and systemic racism [2]. By the mid-2010s, it had expanded beyond racial issues to include feminist, LGBTQ+, and anti-capitalist critiques, often associated with progressive politics in the United States and other Western countries [4].

### Key Principles and Components
At its core, woke ideology emphasizes:
- **Awareness of Systemic Oppression**: It posits that societal structures, such as capitalism, patriarchy, and white supremacy, perpetuate inequalities. Adherents advocate for "intersectionality," a framework coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, which examines how overlapping identities (e.g., race, gender, class) compound discrimination [2].
- **Social Justice Activism**: This includes calls for reforms like defunding the police, affirmative action, gender-neutral language, and corporate diversity initiatives. It often involves "cancel culture," where individuals or entities are publicly shamed or boycotted for perceived offenses [3].
- **Cultural and Linguistic Sensitivity**: Woke ideology promotes inclusive language (e.g., using "Latinx" instead of "Latino" to be gender-neutral) and challenges cultural appropriation, microaggressions, and historical narratives that marginalize non-dominant groups [4].
- **Critique of Power Structures**: It draws from critical theory, including influences from Marxism and postcolonial studies, arguing that neutrality in the face of injustice upholds the status quo [2].

Supporters argue that woke ideology fosters empathy and progress toward a more equitable society, citing achievements like increased representation in media and policy changes addressing inequality [1]. For example, the #MeToo movement, often linked to woke principles, has led to greater accountability for sexual harassment [4].

### Criticisms and Controversies
Critics, particularly from conservative and centrist perspectives, contend that woke ideology has become dogmatic and intolerant. They describe it as "wokeism" or "woke capitalism," where corporations superficially adopt progressive stances for profit without substantive change [3]. Detractors like linguist John McWhorter argue it functions as a "religion" that prioritizes moral purity over practical solutions, potentially alienating allies and exacerbating divisions [3]. In the UK and US, political figures have weaponized the term in culture wars, with laws in some US states restricting teachings on systemic racism in schools under the guise of combating "woke indoctrination" [4]. Additionally, some critics highlight instances where woke activism leads to overreach, such as censorship or job losses over minor infractions [3].

The term "woke" itself has become polarized: Originally empowering, it is now often used pejoratively by opponents to dismiss progressive views, while some on the left have distanced themselves from it due to its co-optation [2].

### Evolution and Global Impact
Woke ideology has spread globally, influencing debates in Europe, Australia, and beyond. In France, for instance, President Emmanuel Macron has criticized "American wokeism" as a threat to republican values [4]. Its evolution reflects broader shifts in digital activism, where social media amplifies calls for justice but also enables backlash [1]. While not a monolithic ideology—lacking a single manifesto or leader—it represents a cultural shift toward heightened social consciousness, though its future remains contested amid ongoing political polarization [3].

In summary, "woke" ideology is a fluid, evolving framework for addressing social injustices, rooted in anti-racism but expansive in scope. Its interpretation varies widely, from a vital tool for change to a problematic overcorrection, depending on one's perspective.
