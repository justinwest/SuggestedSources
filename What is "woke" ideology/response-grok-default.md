"Woke" ideology refers to a broad and evolving set of beliefs and attitudes centered on awareness of and activism against social injustices, particularly those related to race, gender, sexuality, and systemic inequalities. The term "woke" originated in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) as early as the 1930s, where it meant staying alert to racial prejudice and discrimination—essentially, not being "asleep" to societal wrongs [1]. It gained renewed prominence in the 2010s through movements like Black Lives Matter, where it symbolized heightened consciousness of issues such as police brutality and institutional racism [2]. Over time, "woke" has expanded beyond its roots to encompass a progressive worldview that critiques power structures, promotes inclusivity, and advocates for marginalized groups across various intersections, including feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, environmental justice, and anti-capitalism [3].

At its core, woke ideology emphasizes intersectionality—a concept popularized by scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw—which recognizes how overlapping identities (e.g., race, class, gender) compound experiences of oppression [4]. Proponents argue that being "woke" involves not just awareness but active efforts to dismantle these systems through education, policy changes, and cultural shifts. For instance, it often includes calls for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in workplaces, schools, and media, as well as challenging "microaggressions" and promoting "allyship" with oppressed communities [2]. Supporters view it as a moral imperative for social progress, drawing from historical civil rights struggles and contemporary activism [3].

However, the term has become highly politicized and contested. Critics, particularly from conservative perspectives, often use "woke" pejoratively to describe what they see as excessive political correctness, identity politics, or "cancel culture" that stifles free speech and imposes ideological conformity [5]. They argue that woke ideology can lead to divisiveness, prioritizing group identities over individual merit or national unity, and has been co-opted by corporations and institutions for performative rather than substantive change—a phenomenon dubbed "woke capitalism" [6]. This backlash intensified in the 2020s, with figures like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis framing "anti-woke" policies as defenses against indoctrination in education and business [5].

The ideology's evolution reflects broader cultural debates. While some scholars trace its intellectual roots to critical theory, postmodernism, and thinkers like Michel Foucault, who examined power dynamics in society [4], others contend that "woke" has diluted from its original focus on racial justice into a catch-all label for left-leaning views [1]. Public perception varies: polls indicate that while many Americans support the underlying principles of social justice, the term "woke" itself carries negative connotations for a significant portion, especially among older or conservative demographics [6]. Ultimately, "woke" is not a monolithic ideology but a fluid concept shaped by context, often serving as a shorthand in political discourse rather than a rigid doctrine.
