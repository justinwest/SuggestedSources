### Definition and Origins

The term "woke" is an adjective originating from African American Vernacular English (AAVE), where it initially meant being literally awake or alert. In a socio-political context, it evolved to signify being aware of and attentive to issues of social injustice, particularly racial discrimination and systemic inequalities [1]. The related noun "wokeness" refers to the state, ideology, or cultural phenomenon of embodying this awareness, often encompassing activism against various forms of oppression, including racism, sexism, homophobia, and economic disparity [2].

Historically, the term can be traced back to the 1930s in African American communities. For instance, it appeared in a 1938 protest song by Huddie Ledbetter (Lead Belly) titled "Scottsboro Boys," where he warned Black individuals to "stay woke" to dangers of injustice during the trial of nine Black teenagers falsely accused of rape [3]. The modern usage gained prominence in the 21st century, notably through Erykah Badu's 2008 song "Master Teacher," which includes the refrain "I stay woke," emphasizing vigilance against societal ills [1]. It surged in popularity during the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement around 2014, with phrases like "stay woke" becoming a call to action against police brutality and racial inequality [2].

### Evolution and Broader Usage

Over time, "woke" has broadened beyond racial justice to include awareness of other progressive causes, such as environmental issues, gender equality, and LGBTQ+ rights. In positive contexts, being woke is seen as a virtue: it encourages empathy, education, and advocacy for marginalized groups, fostering a more equitable society [4]. For example, corporations and institutions have adopted "woke" branding in diversity initiatives, such as inclusive hiring practices or campaigns supporting social causes [2].

However, the term has also become polarized. In the 2010s and 2020s, critics—often from conservative viewpoints—have repurposed "woke" and "wokeness" pejoratively to describe what they perceive as excessive political correctness, performative activism, or an overreach of progressive ideologies that stifle free speech or impose "cancel culture" [5]. This shift is evident in political discourse, where figures like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have used "woke" as a shorthand for opposing certain educational curricula on race and gender [5]. Linguists note that this evolution reflects a common pattern where terms from marginalized communities are co-opted and redefined in mainstream culture [1].

### Key Characteristics and Criticisms

Wokeness is often characterized by:
- **Awareness and Education**: Encouraging individuals to recognize implicit biases and historical contexts of oppression [4].
- **Activism**: Promoting actions like protests, policy changes, or boycotts to address inequalities [2].
- **Intersectionality**: Understanding how different forms of discrimination overlap, a concept popularized by scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw [3].

Criticisms include accusations that wokeness can lead to divisiveness, where disagreement is equated with bigotry, or that it prioritizes symbolism over substantive change (e.g., "virtue signaling") [5]. Supporters counter that such critiques often dismiss legitimate calls for justice and serve to maintain the status quo [4]. The term's meaning continues to evolve, influenced by social media, where it can be both a badge of honor and a target for satire [1].

In summary, "woke" and "wokeness" represent a dynamic concept rooted in social awareness but subject to varying interpretations based on cultural and political lenses. Its usage highlights ongoing debates about progress, identity, and power in society.
