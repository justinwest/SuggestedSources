**“Woke” ideology** generally refers to a set of beliefs centered around awareness of social injustices and a commitment to addressing systemic inequalities. The term “woke” originally emerged in African American slang, meaning alertness to racism and social injustice ([www.merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/woke-meaning-origin#:~:text=,leaning)). Merriam-Webster defines *woke* as being “aware of and actively attentive to important facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice),” noting the word gained wider use during the Black Lives Matter movement in the 2010s ([www.merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/woke-meaning-origin#:~:text=,leaning)). In this original sense, to be woke was a positive description—essentially being socially conscious and informed about inequality. 

As an ideology, *woke* encompasses progressive values and advocacy for marginalized groups. It is rooted in the belief that systemic injustices (such as racism, sexism, or other forms of discrimination) exist in society and must be actively identified and remedied. One commentator describes *woke* as a modern left-wing political ideology focused on recognizing and fighting structural inequalities ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=The%20word%20woke%20loosely%20refers,other%20forms%20of%20pervasive%20prejudice)). A woke perspective emphasizes issues like racial equity, gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and other social justice causes. For example, someone who is *woke* is highly attuned to instances of prejudice or privilege—they strive to “stay awake” to unfairness in institutions and everyday life and push for changes that promote equity and inclusion ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=The%20word%20woke%20loosely%20refers,other%20forms%20of%20pervasive%20prejudice)). This often involves challenging established power structures, calling out discriminatory behavior (even when subtle), and championing policies or cultural shifts that support historically disadvantaged groups. 

The meaning and connotation of *“woke”* have evolved and now vary greatly depending on who is using the term ([abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/woke-conservatives/story?id=93051138#:~:text=The%20definition%20of%20,depending%20on%20who%20you%20ask)). Many progressives and social justice advocates still use *woke* in a positive way, as a badge of awareness and empathy toward societal injustices. In its early usage, *woke* was indeed a proud expression of having *awakened* to injustice – for example, writer Rebecca Solnit notes that the word described “the quality of having awakened, especially to injustice and racism” among Black Americans before it entered mainstream use ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=Once%20upon%20a%20time%2C%20the,Woke%20was%20such%20a%20word)). To supporters, embracing woke ideals means being conscious of historical and ongoing oppression and working to **make society more fair and inclusive**. However, in today’s political discourse, *“woke”* is often used with negative overtones—especially by some conservatives who apply it as an umbrella term for a wide range of progressive values they criticize ([abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/woke-conservatives/story?id=93051138#:~:text=The%20term%20has%20recently%20been,using%20it%20with%20negative%20connotations)). In this context, “woke ideology” is portrayed as a caricature of far-left politics or *social engineering*. Critics use *woke* as a catch-all label for what they deem excessive political correctness or extreme identity-based politics. The term gets invoked in debates over issues like school curricula, corporate diversity programs, gender-neutral language, and more. For instance, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has explicitly declared “we reject woke ideology” as a rallying cry, while pursuing policies to limit what he views as *“woke”* influences in education and government ([abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/woke-conservatives/story?id=93051138#:~:text=gubernatorial%20candidate%20Rep,8%2C%202022%2C%20in%20Tampa%2C%20Fla)). In such usages, *woke* becomes a pejorative shorthand, signaling a broad rejection of modern progressive social change. 

**Critiques and Controversies:** Those who criticize *woke ideology* argue that it can be dogmatic or divisive. Conservative commentators often claim that *woke* activists prioritize group identities and differences over shared national values or individual merit. British author Douglas Murray, for example, describes *“wokeness”* as a tyrannical mindset that elevates racial, gender, and sexual identities above our common humanity ([www.rnz.co.nz](https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/saturday/audio/2018726945/douglas-murray-the-groupthink-tyranny-of-woke#:~:text=Divided%20by%20our%20race%2C%20gender,higher%20priority%20than%20our%20sameness)). Detractors frequently associate *woke* ideas with concepts like *cancel culture*, *radical identity politics*, and extreme *political correctness*, suggesting that this ideology pressures people to conform to a left-wing viewpoint and ostracizes those who dissent ([en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org](https://en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org/wiki/Woke#:~:text=Both%20the%20word%20woke%20and,that%20the%20concept%20of%20being)). They point to instances where zealous “woke” activism – in their view – has led to public shaming, censorship, or the loss of livelihoods for individuals deemed insufficiently progressive. Some critics also argue that *woke* practices can be performative or lacking in substance: for example, focusing on symbolic gestures and language changes rather than practical solutions. Even a few liberal and center-left voices have cautioned that certain “woke” behaviors (such as jargon-heavy or moralizing language) may alienate potential allies or distract from concrete policy goals. This perspective holds that an overly rigid commitment to woke ideals can sometimes backfire, creating culture-war flashpoints instead of consensus. 

**Supporters’ Perspective:** On the other hand, supporters of what is often called *woke ideology* emphasize that being *woke* simply means striving for a more just, equal society. From this viewpoint, *wokeness* is about compassion, inclusion, and a willingness to question the status quo in order to help disadvantaged groups. Advocates see the term’s origins as a call to *stay alert* to injustice – a reminder not to ignore racism, inequality, or other social ills. They often view the backlash against “woke” as disproportionate or in bad faith. Deriding something as *“woke”*, in their view, has become a way to dismiss or belittle sincere efforts to address discrimination. Rebecca Solnit, for instance, argues that the term *woke* was **“kidnapped”** by its opponents – turned into a caricature or *“zombie”* term used to sneer at people who are concerned about racism and other injustices ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=Once%20upon%20a%20time%2C%20the,Woke%20was%20such%20a%20word)). In other words, many who believe in the core ideals behind *woke* feel that the word itself has been twisted and weaponized, even as the underlying goals of equity and awareness remain worthy. To its proponents, *woke ideology* represents a continued push for societal progress – expanding civil rights, educating about biases, and holding powerful institutions accountable – and the hostility toward the word *woke* says more about resistance to change than about the ideals themselves. 

In summary, **“woke ideology”** refers to a broad framework of social consciousness that urges people to recognize and confront injustice. It aligns with progressive, inclusive values – challenging racism, sexism, and other inequities – and encourages constant awareness of how these issues pervade society. At the same time, the term *“woke”* has become highly polarized in modern discourse. Depending on the context, calling something *woke* might be meant as praise for its social awareness or, conversely, as an insult implying overzealous or misguided activism. The definition *“changes depending on who you ask,”* as one news report observes ([abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/woke-conservatives/story?id=93051138#:~:text=The%20definition%20of%20,depending%20on%20who%20you%20ask)). To some, *woke* is a positive ethos of empathy and enlightenment; to others, it has become a catch-all epithet for a perceived extreme progressive orthodoxy. Understanding *woke ideology* today thus requires recognizing both its origin as a rallying cry for justice and the divergent reactions it provokes in the ongoing culture wars.

1. **Merriam-Webster Dictionary** – *Definition and origin of “woke.”* Merriam-Webster notes that *woke* means being aware of important social issues (especially racial and social justice). The term originated in African American English and entered mainstream usage around the mid-2010s. By the end of that decade it had also started to be used pejoratively, as a general insult for anyone perceived as politically left-leaning ([www.merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/woke-meaning-origin#:~:text=,leaning)).

2. **Zaid Jilani (The Guardian)** – *Description of woke as a modern left-wing ideology.* Jilani, writing in *The Guardian*, explains that *“woke”* refers to a social-media-fueled leftist political ideology that emerged in the early 2010s. The term derives from the idea of being **awake** to structural inequalities in society and hyper-aware of one’s own role in those injustices. According to Jilani, someone who is woke is constantly scrutinizing institutions for the presence of racism, sexism, and other pervasive prejudices. What separates a woke person from a more traditional progressive, he argues, is a fervent insistence that everyone must be enlisted in these social causes at all times, and a belief that fighting injustice may justify pushing past conventional norms (for example, placing *equity* outcomes above absolute free-speech neutrality) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=The%20word%20woke%20loosely%20refers,other%20forms%20of%20pervasive%20prejudice)) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=enlisted%20into%20their%20social%20causes,the%20means%20when%20battling%20injustice)).

3. **Kiara Alfonseca (ABC News)** – *How the term’s meaning shifts between communities.* Alfonseca’s reporting for ABC News emphasizes that the definition of “woke” often *“changes depending on who you ask.”* In recent years, conservative politicians and media have co-opted *woke* as an umbrella label for progressive values and initiatives – typically applying the term with negative connotations ([abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/woke-conservatives/story?id=93051138#:~:text=The%20term%20has%20recently%20been,using%20it%20with%20negative%20connotations)). By contrast, the word *woke* was originally popularized by progressive Black Americans in the mid-20th century and meant being informed and conscious of racial injustices. (For instance, *Merriam-Webster* records that to be “woke” in Black communities meant someone was educated and aware of social inequality ([abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/woke-conservatives/story?id=93051138#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20term%20was%20originally,1900s)).) Alfonseca notes that Florida’s Governor, Ron DeSantis, even formally defined **“woke ideology”** as the belief there are systemic injustices in society that need to be addressed – a definition he then explicitly rejected while campaigning against what he called *“woke”* influence in schools and government ([abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/woke-conservatives/story?id=93051138#:~:text=gubernatorial%20candidate%20Rep,8%2C%202022%2C%20in%20Tampa%2C%20Fla)).

4. **Rebecca Solnit (The Guardian)** – *Progressive view on the misuse of “woke.”* Solnit, a progressive author and Guardian columnist, recounts that *woke* once straightforwardly meant having *awakened* to injustice and racism. The slang’s early life was nurtured in Black American communities as a call to awareness. However, Solnit argues that the term was later **“kidnapped”** by its foes – “old white conservatives” who turned *woke* into a derisive buzzword. Rather than allow the concept to thrive, she says, opponents wielded *“woke”* as a weapon, sending the word out as a “zombie mercenary” to *“sneer at those who were concerned about racism and other injustices.”* In her view, this cynical distortion robbed the term of its original meaning and effectively killed its usefulness – a fate that left its original users indifferent (or even glad) to abandon the word ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=Once%20upon%20a%20time%2C%20the,Woke%20was%20such%20a%20word)) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=zombie%20mercenary%20sent%20out%20to,The%20end)). 

5. **Douglas Murray (RNZ Interview)** – *Conservative critique of woke ideology.* Murray, a British conservative commentator, is deeply critical of what he calls *“wokeness.”* In an RNZ interview about his book, he describes woke ideology as a form of groupthink that he finds divisive. According to Murray, *wokeness* entails obsessing over identity categories – dividing people by race, gender, and sexual orientation – and giving those differences priority over shared humanity and unity. He characterizes this mindset as **tyrannical**, suggesting that it forces society into factions and silos. Murray’s perspective is that *woke* activists demand strict adherence to their views on gender, race, and identity, stifling open debate; he warns that such *woke* groupthink undermines social cohesion and free expression ([www.rnz.co.nz](https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/saturday/audio/2018726945/douglas-murray-the-groupthink-tyranny-of-woke#:~:text=Divided%20by%20our%20race%2C%20gender,higher%20priority%20than%20our%20sameness)).

6. **Various Commentators (Summarized in Wikipedia)** – *“Woke” as a pejorative and culture-war term.* Analyses compiled on Wikipedia note that over time *woke* (and *wokeness*) have increasingly been used in a derogatory sense. Commentators across the political spectrum have observed that *“woke”* became a loaded label often synonymous with extreme *identity politics*, *cancel culture*, or *virtue signaling* ([en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org](https://en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org/wiki/Woke#:~:text=Both%20the%20word%20woke%20and,that%20the%20concept%20of%20being)). In public discourse, especially on the right, the term is frequently deployed as a catch-all shorthand for progressive changes that critics view as overzealous or absurd. This reflects how a word that began as an empowering call to awareness has been transformed, in some quarters, into a punchline or political grenade in the broader culture wars.
