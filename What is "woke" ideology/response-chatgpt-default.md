**“Woke” ideology generally refers to a set of beliefs focused on recognizing and addressing social injustices. The term *woke* originated in African American slang, historically meaning to be awake to racial prejudice and oppression ([edition.cnn.com](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/10/us/woke-race-deconstructed-newsletter-reaj/index.html#:~:text=Once%20upon%20a%20time%2C%20many,patterns%20of%20racism%20and%20oppression)). In the 2010s it entered mainstream usage to describe being “alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice” ([inews.co.uk](https://inews.co.uk/news/what-woke-culture-mean-term-explained-definition-changed-2365401?ico=in-line_link#:~:text=The%20OED%20says%3A%20%E2%80%9CThe%20original,a%20political%20or%20cultural%20sense)) – essentially, a broad awareness of inequities in society and a commitment to change.

As an ideology, being *woke* encompasses a range of progressive, social justice-oriented causes. It is associated with left-wing or socially liberal movements advocating racial equality, gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and other efforts to combat injustice ([en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org](https://en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org/wiki/Woke#:~:text=First%20used%20in%20the%201940s%2C,1)). In practice, a “woke” person is highly attentive to systemic bias – continuously scrutinizing social institutions for signs of racism, sexism, or other forms of prejudice ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=The%20word%20woke%20loosely%20refers,other%20forms%20of%20pervasive%20prejudice)). This outlook emphasizes consciousness of one’s own privilege or positionality and support for policies that promote inclusion and equity.

In modern political discourse, *woke* has also become a controversial and often derogatory term ([inews.co.uk](https://inews.co.uk/news/what-woke-culture-mean-term-explained-definition-changed-2365401?ico=in-line_link#:~:text=The%20word%20%E2%80%9Cwoke%E2%80%9D%20has%20become,ending%20culture%20war)). Critics frequently use “woke” or “wokeism” in a negative sense to imply an overly radical or performative progressive ideology ([www.dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/wokeism#:~:text=1,to%20systemic%20injustices%20and%20prejudices)). For example, opponents argue that “woke” activists demand strict conformity to their views and sometimes override traditional liberal values (like open debate or viewpoint neutrality) in the name of social justice ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=What%20separates%20someone%20who%20is,the%20means%20when%20battling%20injustice)). Some even portray *woke ideology* as a revolutionary threat to Western cultural norms and institutions ([www.heritage.org](https://www.heritage.org/progressivism/report/reason-revelation-and-identity-politics#:~:text=Wokeism%20aims%20to%20remake%20Western,a%20mutating%20law%20and%20politics)). This backlash is evident in the political arena: for instance, Florida’s governor Ron DeSantis has warned of a “far-left woke agenda” and moved to ban what he calls “woke indoctrination” in schools ([inews.co.uk](https://inews.co.uk/news/what-woke-culture-mean-term-explained-definition-changed-2365401?ico=in-line_link#:~:text=Mr%20DeSantis%2C%20like%20many%20right,called%20%E2%80%9Cwoke%E2%80%9D)).

On the other hand, supporters of what is labeled *woke* ideology maintain that *“woke”* simply means being conscious of inequality and committed to fairness ([inews.co.uk](https://inews.co.uk/news/what-woke-culture-mean-term-explained-definition-changed-2365401?ico=in-line_link#:~:text=The%20OED%20says%3A%20%E2%80%9CThe%20original,a%20political%20or%20cultural%20sense)). They argue that the term’s popular usage has strayed far from its positive original meaning, due to mischaracterization in political culture wars ([inews.co.uk](https://inews.co.uk/news/what-woke-culture-mean-term-explained-definition-changed-2365401?ico=in-line_link#:~:text=The%20word%20%E2%80%9Cwoke%E2%80%9D%20has%20become,ending%20culture%20war)). Some note that conservative figures have deliberately weaponized “woke” as a buzzword to stoke backlash and fear, analogous to how past racial justice slogans were demonized ([edition.cnn.com](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/05/opinions/woke-weaponized-racism-gaslighting-cane-ctpr#:~:text=I%20must%20give%20credit%20to,%E2%80%9CWoke%E2%80%9D%20is%20their%20latest%20stunt)). From this perspective, *woke* ideals are about empathy and social awareness – striving to make society more equal and inclusive – rather than a sinister or dogmatic agenda.

By the 2020s it became an imprecise catch-all pejorative used by some conservatives to criticize progressive social action ([edition.cnn.com](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/10/us/woke-race-deconstructed-newsletter-reaj/index.html#:~:text=Once%20upon%20a%20time%2C%20many,patterns%20of%20racism%20and%20oppression)).

3. **Wikipedia:** Summarizes *“woke”* as slang associated with left-wing politics and social justice causes. By the late 2010s, the term encompassed progressive movements such as anti-racism, feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, and environmentalism, while also attracting ironic use and criticism for perceived excesses ([en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org](https://en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org/wiki/Woke#:~:text=First%20used%20in%20the%201940s%2C,1)).

5. **Zaid Jilani (The Guardian):** Describes *woke ideology* as a **left-wing political ideology** that arose in the early 2010s, rooted in being conscious of structural inequalities ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=The%20word%20woke%20loosely%20refers,other%20forms%20of%20pervasive%20prejudice)). Jilani, writing from a critical perspective, argues that *“woke”* adherents exhibit intense vigilance for racism and sexism in all facets of society and insist on enlisting everyone in their causes. He contends this movement can become zealous to the point of justifying extreme measures and neglecting classical liberal principles (like free speech or neutrality) in pursuit of “social justice” goals ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/09/woke-word-meaning-definition-progressive#:~:text=What%20separates%20someone%20who%20is,the%20means%20when%20battling%20injustice)).

6. **Lewis M. Andrews (Heritage Foundation):** Presents a conservative critique of *woke ideology*, characterizing *“wokeism”* as an effort to radically remake Western society. Andrews argues this ideology seeks to transform institutions (from politics and law to education) by prioritizing group identity and grievances over individual rights. In his view, *woke* activists would replace the traditional liberal order with a new system centered on perceived oppression, demanding continual changes to norms and policies ([www.heritage.org](https://www.heritage.org/progressivism/report/reason-revelation-and-identity-politics#:~:text=Wokeism%20aims%20to%20remake%20Western,a%20mutating%20law%20and%20politics)).

7. **Clay Cane (CNN Opinion):** Offers a defense of the original meaning of *“woke”* and criticizes how it’s been weaponized. Cane argues that conservatives have co-opted *“woke”* as a scare tactic – *“their latest stunt”* – to rally their base, similar to how terms like “Black Power” were distorted in the past. He emphasizes that, in reality, being *woke* simply signifies consciousness of injustice, and he calls the anti-woke crusade a form of political gaslighting aimed at discrediting legitimate social concerns ([edition.cnn.com](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/05/opinions/woke-weaponized-racism-gaslighting-cane-ctpr#:~:text=I%20must%20give%20credit%20to,%E2%80%9CWoke%E2%80%9D%20is%20their%20latest%20stunt)).
