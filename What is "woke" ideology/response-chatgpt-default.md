**Definition and Origins:** The term **“woke”** originated as slang in African-American English, meaning *awake* to social injustice and discrimination【1】【2】. In essence, being “woke” implies being highly aware of societal issues such as racism, inequality, and other forms of oppression【1】. The related noun **“wokeness”** refers to this state of alertness to social problems and injustice【1】. The concept has roots in Black American communities: for example, a 1930s blues song cautioned listeners to “stay woke” to the dangers of racist threats, and a 1962 *New York Times* essay by William Melvin Kelley discussed *woke* as an African-American slang term for enlightened awareness【1】【2】. Originally, **woke** simply meant *well-informed* or *up-to-date* – the Oxford English Dictionary notes that it *formerly* meant being informed, but **now chiefly** means being “alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice”【1】.  

**Mainstream Popularization:** The concept of being *woke* remained in Black vernacular for decades, but it entered mainstream usage in the 2010s amid rising social justice movements【2】. During the 2014 Ferguson protests and the Black Lives Matter movement, activists urged communities to “stay woke” in the face of police brutality and racial inequality【2】. The term spread via social media (notably on Black Twitter) and was adopted by many young Americans as a badge of awareness or allyship with marginalized groups【2】. As usage broadened beyond its original context, *woke* gained recognition in official lexicons – by 2017, the term was added to the Oxford English Dictionary, reflecting its new prominence in popular vocabulary【2】. The surge of racial justice protests in 2020 (after George Floyd’s murder) further propelled “woke” into global discourse, making it a widely recognized shorthand for consciousness of social inequality【3】.  

**Backlash and Evolving Connotations:** Over time, “woke” also acquired negative connotations in some quarters. By the late 2010s, conservative and centrist commentators began invoking “woke” sarcastically or as an insult【2】. In this pejorative sense, *woke* is used to imply someone is overly politically correct or excessively progressive in a way deemed extreme or unreasonable【4】. (*Merriam-Webster*’s dictionary, for example, notes that **woke**, used disapprovingly, describes a person who is liberal “in a way that is considered unreasonable or extreme”【4】.) In U.S. politics especially, **“woke”** has become a buzzword for right-wing critics to lump together progressive social policies they oppose【3】. Republican politicians now routinely deride “woke” ideas in education, business, and media – Florida’s governor even enacted a **“Stop W.O.K.E. Act”** to restrict what his administration calls “woke indoctrination” in schools【5】. Analysts point out that this anti-woke rhetoric often serves as a **dog whistle** – a coded way to rally opposition to racial and social justice initiatives without explicitly mentioning race【5】. In essence, the term **woke** has been **co-opted** by opponents of progressive change, turning a call for awareness into a catch-all slur against modern left-leaning values【3】.  

**Debate and Usage Today:** Because of these shifts, **“wokeness”** has become a contested term with starkly different interpretations. Supporters view wokeness as a positive **awareness** – a call to stay mindful of injustice and to advocate for equitable treatment of marginalized groups. In this sense, being *woke* is seen as being enlightened and socially conscious, aligned with ideals of fairness and empathy【1】. However, critics (across the political spectrum) argue that wokeness can veer into performative activism or dogmatism. Right-wing critics often claim “woke culture” is superficial or divisive, prioritizing symbolic gestures over substance【2】. At the same time, some left-wing or liberal commentators worry that a fixation on identity politics under the *woke* banner undermines broader working-class solidarity and universal humanist values【2】【6】. There is concern that certain “woke” practices emphasize virtue-signaling and language policing over tangible progress, leading to public fatigue or backlash【6】. Indeed, terms like **“woke-washing”** and **“woke capitalism”** have emerged to accuse corporations of superficially embracing progressive rhetoric for goodwill, rather than implementing real change【2】.  

In summary, **woke** and **wokeness** broadly refer to social awareness and the drive to address injustices. The terms’ meanings have evolved from their origins in Black American slang to become mainstream shorthand for progressive consciousness. Yet today they carry a dual legacy: for many, *wokeness* signifies a laudable vigilance against inequality, while for others “woke” is used derisively to label something as overly political or extreme. This duality has made *wokeness* a flashpoint in contemporary culture wars – encapsulating debates over how society should pursue equality and social change【3】【6】.

It recounts how *woke* was originally positive (meaning well-informed) but has “undergone a metamorphosis,” becoming a derogatory slur in some quarters and a badge of honour in others. The author traces *woke* back to a 1962 New York Times essay by William Kelley (and even earlier Black American usage) and opines that modern wokeness is *“not the new enlightenment… it is the antithesis of enlightenment.”* [Link](https://www.ieducation.co.za/waking-up-to-wokeness-and-cancel-culture/)  

2. **Wikipedia – “Woke” (2025)** – The Wikipedia entry provides a historical and neutral overview of *woke*. It explains that *woke* originated in African-American vernacular in the 1930s, meaning alert to racial prejudice and injustice. Over time the term broadened to awareness of *social* inequalities (sexism, LGBTQ rights, etc.) and became shorthand for certain left-wing **social justice** ideas. The article notes that by the late 2010s *“woke”* was adopted as a sarcastic pejorative by many on the political right (and some centrists), who dismiss progressive movements as *performative* or insincere (“*performative activism*”). It also mentions critiques from the left – for example, that excessive wokeness can hinder working-class solidarity – and describes terms like *woke-washing* or *woke capitalism* (criticizing companies for exploiting woke messaging).

3. **Axios – “*‘Woke’ and the backlash to the term*” (Nov 17, 2024)** – This explainer article outlines the rise of *“woke”* and the ensuing backlash. Axios notes that *woke* gained wide recognition after the 2020 George Floyd protests, originally indicating awareness of social inequalities and cultural sensitivity. It explains that conservatives have since **co-opted** “woke” as a catch-all label to criticize progressive views they oppose. The piece points out that President Trump and others pledged to purge “woke” influences from education, the military, etc., and it likens the anti-woke rhetoric to historical coded phrases (dog whistles like “law and order”) that allow politicians to stoke opposition to racial justice without explicit racism.

4. **Merriam-Webster Dictionary – “Woke”** – The Merriam-Webster entry for *woke* (chiefly U.S. slang) gives both the positive and negative connotations. It defines *woke* in the approving sense as “aware of and actively attentive to important societal facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice).” It also notes a **disapproving** meaning: *woke* can describe someone as politically liberal or progressive “*in a way that is considered unreasonable or extreme*.” This shows how the term’s common usage has shifted to include a pejorative sense.

5. ***Time* – “Why ‘Woke’ Is a Convenient Republican Dog Whistle” (Jan 2023)** – This *Time* article (by columnist Jeffery Tulloch) argues that Republican politicians have weaponized *“woke”* as a pejorative **dog whistle**. It highlights Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s “war on woke” (including the Stop W.O.K.E. Act) as an example of using *“woke”* to justify banning topics like racial history by branding them as radical. The author notes data showing the term *woke* is embraced by a much larger share of Black Americans than white Americans – underlining that anti-woke rhetoric often targets demands for racial justice. The piece suggests that by slapping the *“woke”* label on various issues, Republicans gain *plausible deniability* (framing their actions as anti-extremism rather than anti-minority) while tapping into voters’ racial resentments.

6. ***Financial Times* – “Where ‘woke’ went wrong” (Feb 2025)** – This FT article examines the growing backlash against “woke” culture and reflects on how perceptions of wokeness have shifted. It notes that figures like Elon Musk and Donald Trump helped spur anti-“woke” sentiment, and even some on the left (e.g. Kamala Harris, Mark Zuckerberg) distanced themselves from the term as public attitudes shifted. The author argues that *wokeness* diverged from the ideals of the civil-rights movement – emphasizing narrow group identities over individualism or universal values – which **unintentionally fostered division**. High-profile controversies and rigid ideological purity tests led to public fatigue with “woke” activism. As a result, both corporations and some progressives have pulled back on overt **wokeness**. Still, the article acknowledges that the movement achieved greater awareness of systemic inequalities, even if it now faces a reckoning. The piece suggests that moving forward, advocates must balance passionate social critique with more practical, inclusive approaches to avoid further backlash.
