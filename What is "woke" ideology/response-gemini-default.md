"Woke" and "wokeness" are complex and highly contested terms whose meanings have evolved significantly over time. Originally a term of empowerment within the African American community, it has since entered mainstream discourse, where it is used both as a positive descriptor for social awareness and as a pejorative term for what critics see as performative or overly dogmatic progressive politics.

### 1. Origins and Original Meaning

The term "woke" originates in African American Vernacular English (AAVE). In its most literal sense, it is the past participle of "wake." However, its figurative meaning—to be "awake" to social and political issues, particularly racial prejudice and systemic injustice—has a long history.

The phrase "stay woke" served as a command and a reminder within the Black community to remain vigilant and aware of the social and political dangers they faced, especially from racial discrimination and violence. While the concept is older, one of the first widely cited uses of the phrase in this context appears in a 1938 recording by the folk singer Lead Belly, who warns Black Americans to "stay woke" when traveling through Alabama [1].

In the 21st century, the term was repopularized by the 2008 song "Master Teacher" by Erykah Badu, which features the refrain "I stay woke" [2]. This helped reintroduce the term to a new generation before its explosion into the mainstream. At this stage, to be "woke" was to be a well-informed, conscious, and vigilant advocate for Black rights and liberation.

### 2. Mainstream Adoption and Black Lives Matter

The term "woke" gained widespread prominence with the rise of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, particularly following the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The hashtag #StayWoke became a digital rallying cry on social media, urging people to remain aware of and engaged with issues of police brutality and systemic racism [2].

During this period, the meaning began to broaden. While still centered on racial justice, being "woke" expanded to encompass a general awareness of other forms of social inequality, including sexism, LGBTQ+ discrimination, and other systemic issues. It functioned as a positive shorthand for being committed to social justice and understanding the structural nature of oppression.

### 3. Pejorative Usage and "Wokeism"

As the term became more mainstream, it was co-opted by political and cultural critics, primarily on the right, and transformed into a pejorative. In this context, "woke" is used to mock or dismiss a wide range of progressive ideas and behaviors. The term "wokeness" is often used to describe this as a rigid and intolerant ideology.

The negative connotations associated with "woke" include:

*   **Performative Activism:** The idea that a person or corporation is publicly adopting "woke" stances for social credit or financial gain without genuine commitment, a practice often called "virtue signaling."
*   **Oversensitivity:** Critics use "woke" to describe what they see as an excessive tendency to take offense, particularly in relation to language and cultural representation. This is often linked to the term "snowflake."
*   **"Cancel Culture":** "Wokeness" is frequently blamed for "cancel culture," the practice of publicly shaming and withdrawing support from individuals or entities after they have said or done something considered offensive.
*   **Illiberalism and Dogma:** Some critics argue that "wokeness" has become an illiberal ideology that is intolerant of dissent, stifles free speech, and promotes a simplistic worldview of oppressors and oppressed [4]. The term "wokeism" is often used to frame it as a quasi-religious, dogmatic belief system.

Today, "woke" is often used as a vague, all-purpose insult for nearly any person, policy, or idea associated with progressive politics, from diversity initiatives in corporations to discussions of gender identity in schools [3].

### 4. Key Concepts Associated with Wokeness

The ideas underlying the positive definition of "wokeness" are drawn from various strains of critical theory and social justice advocacy. Key concepts include:

*   **Systemic Injustice:** The belief that social inequalities (like racism, sexism, and homophobia) are not just the product of individual prejudices but are embedded within the structures, laws, and norms of society.
*   **Intersectionality:** A term coined by legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, intersectionality is the analytical framework for understanding how a person's overlapping social and political identities (e.g., race, gender, class, sexual orientation) combine to create unique experiences of discrimination and privilege [5]. For example, the experience of a Black woman is distinct from that of a white woman or a Black man.
*   **Privilege:** The concept that certain groups in society have unearned advantages based on their identity (e.g., white privilege, male privilege). Being "woke" involves recognizing one's own privilege and working to dismantle the systems that grant it.

### Conclusion

In summary, "woke" is a term with a dual, and often contradictory, meaning that is highly dependent on the speaker and the context.

1.  **Original and Affirmative Meaning:** Rooted in AAVE, it signifies a deep awareness of systemic injustices, particularly racism, and a commitment to challenging them.
2.  **Pejorative and Critical Meaning:** Used by critics, it describes a perceived form of performative, overly sensitive, and dogmatic progressive politics.

The journey of the word from a specific call for vigilance within the Black community to a broad and contested political label illustrates the complex ways language is shaped by culture, activism, and political conflict.
