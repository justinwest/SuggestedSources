The terms "woke" and "wokeness" are highly contested and have evolved significantly over time. Their meaning depends heavily on who is using them and in what context. The term originated as a positive call for awareness within the Black community but is now frequently used as a pejorative term in broader political and cultural debates.

### 1. Core Definition and Origins

At its most basic level, "woke" is an adjective derived from African American Vernacular English (AAVE) that means to be "awake" to and actively attentive to important societal issues, particularly those concerning racial and social justice [1, 2]. To be "woke" is to recognize the existence of systemic inequalities and injustices that affect marginalized communities. "Wokeness" is the noun form, describing the state or quality of being woke.

### 2. Historical Evolution

The term's roots can be traced back to the early 20th century. In 1938, the folk-blues singer Lead Belly used the phrase "stay woke" in his song "Scottsboro Boys," which told the story of nine Black teenagers falsely accused of raping two white women. In this context, it was a literal warning for Black people to remain vigilant and aware of racist violence and danger [3].

The term remained primarily within Black culture for decades. Its modern resurgence is often credited to singer-songwriter Erykah Badu, whose 2008 song "Master Teacher" included the refrain "I stay woke" [2, 4].

The term gained widespread prominence with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement starting in 2013 and 2014. The phrase "stay woke" became a hashtag and a rallying cry, urging people to remain aware of police brutality, systemic racism, and other forms of social injustice [4, 5]. During this period, being "woke" was seen as a positive attribute, signifying a commitment to social justice and a deeper understanding of societal problems.

### 3. Contemporary Meanings and Polarization

As the term moved from a specific community into mainstream and global discourse, its meaning began to bifurcate and become a central point of contention in the "culture wars."

#### As a Positive Term of Self-Identification

When used by proponents and those who self-identify as "woke," the term retains its original spirit. It signifies:

*   **Awareness of Systemic Issues:** A recognition that problems like racism, sexism, and homophobia are not just the result of individual prejudices but are embedded in societal structures, laws, and institutions [6].
*   **Commitment to Social Justice:** An active desire to challenge and dismantle these systems of inequality through activism, education, and policy changes.
*   **Intersectionality:** An understanding that various forms of discrimination (based on race, gender, class, sexual orientation, etc.) overlap and intersect, creating unique experiences of disadvantage.

For those who embrace the label, "wokeness" is a synonym for social consciousness, empathy, and a commitment to creating a more equitable world [3].

#### As a Pejorative Term

Beginning around 2016 and accelerating since, "woke" has been co-opted, primarily by political conservatives and other critics, as a derogatory label. In this context, it is used to criticize a wide range of progressive or left-leaning ideas and behaviors [7, 8]. When used negatively, "woke" or "wokeness" is often associated with:

*   **Excessive Political Correctness:** The belief that "woke" culture goes too far in policing language and ideas, leading to self-censorship and the stifling of free speech.
*   **"Cancel Culture":** The practice of publicly shaming and professionally ostracizing individuals for perceived offensive statements or actions, often from their past.
*   **Virtue Signaling:** The idea that people adopt "woke" positions not out of genuine conviction but to display their moral superiority in a performative way.
*   **"Wokeism":** This term is often used to frame wokeness as a rigid, intolerant, and quasi-religious ideology that is dogmatic and hostile to dissent [7, 8]. Critics argue it promotes division by overemphasizing group identity.

In political discourse, "woke" has become a catch-all insult used to attack policies and concepts such as Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives in workplaces, critical race theory in education, LGBTQ+ rights, and environmental regulations [5, 9]. It functions as a cultural shorthand to mobilize opposition against perceived liberal overreach.

### Summary

In conclusion, "woke" does not have a single, stable definition. It began as a term of empowerment within the African American community, signifying a crucial awareness of systemic injustice. As it entered the mainstream, it became a cultural flashpoint. For its supporters, it represents a positive and necessary consciousness of social inequities. For its critics, it has become a pejorative term for a range of progressive ideas they deem performative, divisive, or extreme. Understanding the term requires recognizing its historical roots and its current, deeply polarized usage in political and cultural conversations.
