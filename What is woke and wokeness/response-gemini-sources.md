"Woke" is a term with a complex, evolving, and highly contested meaning. Originally rooted in African American Vernacular English (AAVE), it described an awareness of systemic racism and social injustice. However, in recent years, it has been co-opted and is now frequently used, particularly by political conservatives, as a pejorative term to criticize progressive movements and ideas [1, 2].

### 1. Etymology and Original Meaning

The term "woke" originates from the AAVE adjective meaning "awake" or "well-informed." Its specific use to mean being consciously aware of social and political issues, especially racial prejudice and discrimination, can be traced back to the early 20th century [2, 3].

*   **Early Use:** The phrase "stay woke" was used as a call to action within Black communities, urging vigilance against social and racial threats. One of the most cited early uses is by the blues musician Lead Belly in his 1938 song "Scottsboro Boys," where he warns Black people to "stay woke" when traveling through Alabama [3, 4].
*   **Civil Rights Era:** The term continued to be used throughout the 20th century as a watchword for awareness of the dangers and injustices faced by Black Americans [2].

### 2. Mainstream Popularization

The term gained significant mainstream traction with the rise of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement around 2014. Following the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, "stay woke" became a prominent hashtag (#StayWoke) on social media [2, 5]. In this context, it served as a digital-age rallying cry, signifying a commitment to holding power accountable and staying informed about police brutality and systemic racism. During this period, to be "woke" was to be an engaged and informed activist for social justice [1, 5].

### 3. Shift to a Pejorative and "Wokeness"

By the late 2010s, the meaning of "woke" began to shift dramatically as it was adopted by critics. Political commentators and politicians, primarily on the right, started using the term mockingly to describe progressive ideologies they opposed [1, 6]. In this new context, "woke" is often used to imply that a person or idea is overly sensitive, performative, politically correct to an extreme, or authoritarian in its enforcement of progressive norms [6, 7].

"Wokeness" emerged as a noun to describe this perceived ideology. Critics often use "wokeness" as a catch-all pejorative for a range of progressive concepts and policies, including:

*   **Critical Race Theory (CRT):** A framework for understanding how race and racism have shaped legal systems and societal structures in the United States [7].
*   **Intersectionality:** The concept that different forms of discrimination (like racism, sexism, and classism) overlap and compound one another [1].
*   **Identity Politics:** Political positions based on the interests and perspectives of social groups with which people identify [6].
*   **"Cancel Culture":** The practice of withdrawing support for public figures or companies after they have done or said something considered objectionable [1].

In this pejorative sense, "wokeness" is characterized by its opponents as a divisive and intolerant worldview that promotes "group grievance" over individual merit and universal values [6, 7].

### 4. Summary of Meanings

Today, "woke" exists with two primary, and largely opposing, meanings:

1.  **Original and Positive Meaning:** Being alert to systemic injustice, inequality, and discrimination, particularly concerning race, gender, and sexual orientation. This is the meaning still used by many social justice advocates [3, 5].
2.  **Co-opted and Negative Meaning:** A pejorative term used to mock or dismiss progressive movements, ideas, and individuals as being excessively politically correct, performative, or dogmatic. This is the meaning most prevalent in contemporary political discourse [1, 6].

Due to this polarization, the term's utility as a descriptor is highly debated. Some of the activists who once embraced it now avoid it because of its negative connotations [2].
