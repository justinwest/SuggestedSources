### Definition and Overview

"Woke" is an adjective originating from African American Vernacular English (AAVE), broadly meaning to be alert to injustice and inequality, particularly in social, political, and cultural contexts [1]. The term "wokeness" refers to the state, ideology, or practice of being woke, often encompassing awareness and activism against systemic issues such as racism, sexism, classism, and other forms of discrimination [2]. Initially a positive call to consciousness within marginalized communities, the terms have evolved into a polarizing concept in contemporary discourse, praised by some as a tool for social progress and criticized by others as an overzealous or performative ideology [3].

At its core, being woke involves recognizing and challenging hidden biases and power structures that perpetuate inequality. For example, it might involve acknowledging how policies disproportionately affect minority groups or how media representations reinforce stereotypes. However, the term's meaning has shifted over time, influenced by cultural, political, and media dynamics, leading to debates about its authenticity and application [4].

### Historical Origins and Evolution

The term "woke" derives from the verb "wake," implying awakening from a state of ignorance or complacency. Its earliest documented use in a political sense dates back to the 1930s, in African American communities. A notable example is from a 1938 protest song by Huddie Ledbetter (Lead Belly), who warned Black Americans to "stay woke" about the dangers faced by the Scottsboro Boys, nine Black teenagers falsely accused of rape in Alabama [1]. This usage emphasized vigilance against racial injustice.

The term gained renewed prominence in the 21st century. In 2008, singer Erykah Badu popularized "stay woke" in her song "Master Teacher," urging awareness of societal issues [2]. It exploded into mainstream usage during the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement around 2014, following high-profile police killings of Black individuals like Michael Brown and Eric Garner. BLM activists used "stay woke" as a slogan to highlight systemic racism and encourage informed activism [1][3].

By the mid-2010s, "woke" expanded beyond racial justice to include broader progressive causes, such as gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, environmental justice, and anti-capitalism. This broadening was amplified by social media platforms like Twitter, where hashtags like #StayWoke facilitated global discussions [4]. However, this expansion also led to the term being co-opted or diluted, sometimes applied to corporate branding (e.g., "woke capitalism") or superficial gestures, which critics argue undermine its original intent [5].

### Positive Connotations and Applications

In progressive circles, wokeness is viewed as a positive force for societal change. It encourages empathy, education, and action against oppression. For instance:
- **Awareness of Intersectionality**: Drawing from scholar Kimberl√© Crenshaw's framework, wokeness often involves understanding how overlapping identities (e.g., race, gender, class) compound discrimination [2].
- **Activism and Policy**: It has influenced movements like #MeToo (against sexual harassment) and climate strikes, pushing for reforms in areas like criminal justice and workplace equity [3].
- **Cultural Impact**: Media and entertainment, such as films like *Black Panther* or books like Ibram X. Kendi's *How to Be an Antiracist*, embody woke principles by promoting diverse narratives and challenging stereotypes [4].

Advocates argue that wokeness fosters a more inclusive society, helping to dismantle long-standing inequalities [2].

### Criticisms and Negative Connotations

Conversely, "woke" and "wokeness" have become pejorative terms in conservative and centrist critiques, often synonymous with "political correctness gone mad" or "virtue signaling" [5]. Critics contend that wokeness promotes division, censorship, and an intolerance for differing views, sometimes leading to "cancel culture" where individuals are publicly shamed for perceived offenses [3][5].

For example:
- Political figures like former U.S. President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have used "woke" as a catch-all term to oppose progressive policies, such as diversity training in schools or corporate DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives [5].
- Some argue it prioritizes identity politics over universal values, potentially stifling free speech or economic progress [6].
- Satirical uses, like in memes or media, portray wokeness as performative or hypocritical, such as brands exploiting social issues for profit without substantive change [4].

This shift reflects a broader cultural war, where the term has been weaponized in political rhetoric, especially in the U.S. and U.K. [6].

### Contemporary Usage and Debates

Today, "woke" is a fluid term, varying by context. In academia and activism, it remains a call to critical consciousness [2]. In popular culture, it can be empowering or mocking, depending on the speaker. Linguists note that its overuse has led to semantic bleaching, where the word loses specificity [1]. Debates often center on whether wokeness is a genuine moral awakening or an ideological excess, with surveys showing generational divides: younger people tend to view it positively, while older demographics are more skeptical [4].

In summary, woke and wokeness originated as tools for social awareness but have become contested symbols in global discourse. Understanding them requires considering both their empowering roots and the criticisms they attract, reflecting deeper societal tensions around justice and identity.
