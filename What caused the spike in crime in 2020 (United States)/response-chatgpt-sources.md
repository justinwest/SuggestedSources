Causes of the 2020 crime spike in the United States  

The 29% jump in murders and the parallel rise in shootings and aggravated assaults recorded in 2020 did not stem from a single trigger.  The three sources agree that several concurrent shocks hit the nation at the same time and interacted with one another.

1. COVID-19–related social and institutional disruption  
   • Lockdowns closed schools, after-school centers, churches and other “safe” places, depriving especially young men of routine structure and mediation [2][3].  
   • Courts, probation offices, violence-interruption programs and many social-service agencies scaled back or shut down, so disputes that would normally be defused often escalated [2][3].  

2. Economic stress and personal strain  
   Mass layoffs, housing insecurity and widespread anxiety increased the pool of people under acute pressure, a classic ingredient in violent incidents [2].  

3. Police pull-back and strained police-community relations  
   • Departments were hit by illness, were ordered to minimize contact to limit contagion, and then faced intense scrutiny and hostility after the killing of George Floyd in May 2020.  Officers in many cities reported lower morale and cut back on discretionary, proactive stops that historically deter armed offenders [1][3].  
   • Large-scale protests diverted officers away from normal patrol and, in some cities, budgets were frozen or reduced, further limiting presence on the street [1].  Criminologists note that when perceived risk of being caught falls, violence tends to rise [2].  

4. Rapid decarceration and bail/charging changes  
   To slow the spread of COVID-19, jails and prisons released tens of thousands of inmates, and prosecutors in several large jurisdictions curtailed the use of cash bail or declined to pursue many non-violent charges.  Heritage authors argue that this returned high-risk offenders to the street and signaled lower consequences for crime [1].  

5. A historic surge in gun purchasing  
   Roughly 17 million firearms were sold in 2020, millions to first-time buyers.  More guns in circulation increased the probability that disputes—now occurring without mediating institutions and with fewer police around—ended in gunfire [2][3].  

6. Interaction rather than one dominant cause  
   The Pew review cautions that “no one factor alone explains the 2020 rise”; scholars see a “perfect storm” in which the pandemic, a weakened justice system, anti-police unrest and a flood of firearms reinforced one another [2].  The Inquisitive Bird analysis reaches a similar conclusion, calling the spike “multifactor and historically unusual,” and notes that homicide numbers began to level off once several of these pressures eased in mid-2021 [3].  Heritage authors emphasize criminal-justice policies and anti-police rhetoric but still acknowledge that the pandemic created the environment in which violence flourished [1].  

In short, the 2020 spike was produced by overlapping forces: COVID-19’s social and economic shock, reduced policing and eroded police legitimacy, the release of offenders and looser charging/bail rules, and an unprecedented rise in gun availability.  Researchers continue to disentangle the relative weight of each factor, but the evidence to date points to their combined effect rather than a single, simple cause.
