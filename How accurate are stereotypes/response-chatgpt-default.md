Short answer: Some stereotypes contain kernels of statistical truth at the group level, but their accuracy varies widely by domain and is often modest. Even when group-level beliefs are partly accurate, they are poor guides to judging individuals, can be miscalibrated or outdated, and can produce serious social harms. The safest rule is to prefer individual information over group-based generalizations, and to be cautious about treating any stereotype as a reliable “fact.”

What “accuracy” means in this context
- Consensus vs. correspondence: Agreement among people about a stereotype (consensus) is not the same as accuracy. Accuracy requires comparing beliefs to external criteria (e.g., meta-analyses, census data) [1].
- Dimensions of accuracy: Researchers examine direction (which group is higher), magnitude (how big the difference is), rank-order (relative standings across groups), dispersion (perceived vs actual within-group variability), and calibration (are probabilities well estimated?) [1–2].

What the best evidence shows
- Sometimes moderately accurate:
  - Gender differences: On average, people’s beliefs about the direction and approximate size of many sex differences (e.g., some interests and Big Five personality facets) show moderate correspondence with meta-analytic findings, though the absolute differences are often small to medium [2,4]. Reviews also argue that stereotype accuracy is often nontrivial across a range of domains when assessed against good criteria [2–3].
- Often inaccurate or incomplete:
  - National character: Widespread beliefs about national personality traits do not match measured trait differences across nations; these stereotypes are largely inaccurate [5].
  - Exaggerated differences and misunderstood distributions: People commonly overestimate between-group differences, underestimate within-group variability (outgroup homogeneity), and form illusory correlations that create or amplify inaccurate stereotypes [6–7].
  - Heuristics and miscalibration: Representativeness and base-rate neglect lead people to ignore real base rates or overgeneralize salient cases, degrading accuracy [8].
  - Many gender differences are small: The gender similarities hypothesis shows that for most psychological variables, men and women are more alike than different, so stereotypes that imply large gaps are often overstated [9].
- Dynamic and context-bound: Stereotypes can lag behind social change (e.g., shifts in roles, education, or labor markets). Even once-accurate generalizations can become outdated unless regularly recalibrated [2].

Why group-level “truths” don’t license individual judgments
- Within-group variability is large. Even when a group average differs, distributions typically overlap substantially, making stereotypes unreliable for predicting any given person [1–2,9].
- Ethical and practical costs: Reliance on stereotypes in decisions (hiring, housing, policing) can produce unfair discrimination, independent of any statistical signal [11–12].
- Self-fulfilling and performance effects: Being targeted by a negative stereotype can impair performance (stereotype threat), potentially reinforcing the appearance of the stereotype without reflecting true ability [10].
- Consensus is not evidence: That many people endorse a belief does not make it accurate; consensual stereotypes often reflect shared media and cultural narratives rather than data [1].

How to reason better about group differences
- Prefer individual evidence over category-based assumptions in consequential decisions.
- If you must consider group-level information, check high-quality, current sources; quantify uncertainty; and avoid protected characteristics in decision rules except where legally and ethically justified.
- Treat stereotypes as hypotheses with error bars, not facts; update with new evidence.
- Design processes (e.g., structured interviews, blinded evaluations) that reduce the opportunity for stereotypes to drive judgments [12].

Bottom line
- Stereotypes vary in accuracy: some are moderately accurate at the aggregate level, others are wrong or miscalibrated. Even “accurate” stereotypes are blunt instruments that perform poorly for individuals and carry serious risks. The scientifically and ethically responsible stance is to rely on individual information, be skeptical of generalizations, and regularly update beliefs with high-quality data [1–5,9–12].
