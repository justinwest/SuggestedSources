Short answer: At the group level, many widely held stereotypes show moderate to high correspondence with objective data; in fact, stereotype accuracy is among the largest and most replicable effects in social psychology. But accuracy varies greatly by topic and group, and even accurate group averages are poor guides to individuals. Ethically and practically, you should treat stereotypes as coarse base rates, update them with current evidence, and avoid using them to judge individuals.

What “accuracy” means
- Content accuracy: Are the direction and rank-order of beliefs about groups correct?
- Magnitude accuracy (calibration): Do perceived differences match the size of real differences?
- Dispersion/variability accuracy: Do people recognize large within-group variation and group overlap?
- Criterion correspondence: Do beliefs correlate with reliable, external data (surveys, behavioral records, tests)?

What the evidence shows
- Overall pattern: Reviews and meta-analytic summaries indicate that many demographic stereotypes (e.g., about sex, age, and some occupational or ethnic group averages on concrete outcomes) correlate moderately to strongly with real group differences—often in the r ≈ .30–.60 range and sometimes higher—making stereotype accuracy one of the largest, most replicable findings in social psychology [2][3].  
- Replicability: Across multiple domains and datasets, these accuracy effects have replicated and are larger than many well-known social-psychological effects [3].  
- Where accuracy is higher: 
  - When the criterion is objective and well-measured (e.g., average height, crime rates, income, test means). 
  - When differences are large and observers have regular exposure to cross-group information [2][3].  
- Where accuracy is lower:
  - Politicized/moralized traits and low-base-rate behaviors (where miscalibration is common).
  - Outdated stereotypes that no longer match current data.
  - Some domains—famously, “national character” stereotypes about average personality—show poor accuracy relative to measured Big Five trait levels across nations [4].

Limits and risks, even when group-level stereotypes are accurate
- Individual prediction is error-prone: Most groups strongly overlap on most traits; knowing a group mean provides limited information about a particular person (risk of ecological fallacy) [2][3].  
- Overgeneralization and rigidity: People may neglect within-group variability and fail to update when encountering individuating evidence [1][2].  
- Ethical concerns: Using stereotypes to make high-stakes decisions can be unjust even if statistically grounded, because it treats people as means to group-based ends rather than as individuals; it also risks stigma and self-fulfilling dynamics [1].

Practical guidance
- Treat stereotypes, if used at all, as rough base rates—not as judgments about individuals. Replace them with individualized, diagnostic information whenever possible [1][2].  
- Check calibration against current, high-quality data; many stereotypes are outdated.  
- Use structured, criterion-based assessments (e.g., in hiring, admissions), which outperform intuition and reduce biased overgeneralization.

Bottom line
- Many stereotypes are not wildly wrong; on average they show moderate-to-large correspondence with reality at the group level, a robust and replicable finding [2][3].  
- But accuracy is domain-specific and time-sensitive, and group-level truths rarely justify individual-level judgments. The main problems with stereotyping are less about universal factual inaccuracy and more about miscalibration, misuse, and ethical harm when applied to individuals [1][2][3].
