Elite misinformation refers to misleading narratives, false or skewed information, and flawed conventional wisdom promoted by people and institutions in positions of authority, such as government officials, legacy media outlets, and academic experts [1, 3]. Unlike popular misinformation that often originates from fringe sources, elite misinformation derives its power from the credibility of its source, making it particularly influential and corrosive to public trust [4, 11].

Examples of elite misinformation identified in the provided sources span foreign policy, domestic politics, science, and media coverage:

### Foreign Policy and National Security
*   **The Iraq War:** The consensus among Western political leaders, intelligence agencies, and respected media outlets that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD) is a primary example. This elite-driven narrative, which was promoted with high confidence, ultimately proved to be false and was used to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq [8].
*   **UK Grooming Gangs:** For years, British authorities, social services, and media were accused of deliberately downplaying or ignoring the specific ethnic and religious background of perpetrators in widespread child-exploitation rings in cities like Rotherham. This omission was reportedly driven by a fear among elites of being labeled "racist," which allowed the abuse to continue unchecked for years [9].

### Media Narratives and Political Coverage
*   **Trust and Bias in Mainstream Outlets:** Former NPR editor Uri Berliner argues that the outlet lost America's trust by promoting a rigid, progressive worldview, particularly on stories like the Hunter Biden laptop and the COVID-19 lab-leak theory, where dissenting views were dismissed [4]. Similarly, reporting in *The Economist* suggests that *The New York Times* suffered from an internal shift where news coverage became influenced by activist staff, prioritizing certain narratives around race and identity over traditional objectivity [2]. Jeff Bezos has also noted that a significant portion of the American public does not trust the news media, a problem that undermines its function [3].
*   **Coverage of Donald Trump:** The *Columbia Journalism Review* concluded that in its coverage of Donald Trump, the press often abandoned traditional reporting norms in favor of a more oppositional stance. This shift in tone and framing, while intended to hold power to account, may have alienated readers and been less effective than straightforward reporting [10].
*   **Coverage of Joe Biden:** Nate Silver contends that the media created a distorted narrative around Joe Biden's presidency by focusing excessively on his age and weak poll numbers while downplaying positive economic indicators. This negative framing created a feedback loop that may have unfairly shaped public perception [6].

### Science, Health, and Social Issues
*   **Youth Gender Medicine:** According to an article in *The Atlantic*, a "liberal misinformation bubble" exists around youth gender transition in the United States. It claims that major media outlets and medical organizations have been slow to engage with the more cautious approaches being adopted in some European countries, often framing critical inquiry as inherently transphobic instead of a scientific debate [12]. The handling of the Tavistock clinic scandal in the UK is cited as another example where established institutions failed to address mounting evidence of harm [14].
*   **Highbrow Climate Misinformation:** While outright denial of climate change is a form of popular misinformation, Joseph Heath identifies a more subtle "highbrow" version common among elites. This involves promoting an inaccurate understanding of the problem and its solutions, such as overemphasizing individual actions (like recycling) while downplaying the need for massive, politically difficult technological and industrial overhauls [5].
*   **Education Journalism:** Freddie deBoer argues that elite education journalism often operates as "ideology at its purest," uncritically promoting fashionable reforms and narratives without sufficient evidence. This shapes policy based on trends rather than proven outcomes, misleading the public about the true state of and solutions for education [7].

### Economics
*   **Failure to Predict Major Crises:** Economists, as a group of experts, have been criticized for failing to foresee major events like the 2008 financial crisis and the inflation surge that followed the COVID-19 pandemic. The promotion of economic models with an air of certainty that later proved to be profoundly wrong can be seen as a form of elite misinformation, eroding public faith in economic expertise [13].
