Elite misinformation refers to the dissemination of false or misleading information by influential individuals and institutions, such as high-level government officials, major media organizations, and prominent public figures [1]. Unlike disinformation from fringe sources, this type of misinformation is particularly potent because it originates from sources that the public is generally conditioned to trust [1].

Examples of elite misinformation include:

1.  **The Case for the Iraq War**
    In the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, senior officials in the Bush administration, including President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and Secretary of State Colin Powell, repeatedly claimed that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) [1]. These claims were amplified and given credibility by major media outlets, most notably *The New York Times* [1, 3]. In 2004, the editors of the *Times* published a statement admitting that their coverage was "not as rigorous as it should have been" and that they had given too much credence to information from official and exile sources that was ultimately misleading [3]. The WMD claims were later proven to be false [1].

2.  **Initial Framing of the Hunter Biden Laptop Story**
    In the weeks before the 2020 presidential election, the *New York Post* published a story about a laptop allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden. The story was quickly framed by many mainstream media figures and a group of over 50 former senior intelligence officials as having "all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation" [1]. This elite consensus led to the story being downplayed by major news outlets and suppressed on social media platforms. The core claims of the story were later authenticated by outlets like *The New York Times* and *The Washington Post* [1].

3.  **Denial of the Soviet Famine in Ukraine (Holodomor)**
    During the 1930s, Walter Duranty, the Moscow bureau chief for *The New York Times*, won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the Soviet Union. However, his work largely denied or significantly downplayed the scale of the catastrophic famine in Ukraine, which killed millions [2]. Durantyâ€™s influential reporting presented a sanitized view of the Stalinist regime to the Western world, directly contradicting other available evidence and serving as a form of pro-Soviet propaganda [2].

4.  **Initial Dismissal of the COVID-19 "Lab Leak" Theory**
    Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the hypothesis that the virus may have originated from a laboratory leak in Wuhan, China, was widely dismissed by many prominent scientists and journalists as a fringe conspiracy theory [1]. This dismissal was often presented with a high degree of certainty, creating a consensus that stifled serious debate. Later, the "lab leak" theory was acknowledged by intelligence agencies and parts of the scientific community as a plausible, albeit unproven, possibility, demonstrating that the initial elite certainty had been a form of misinformation [1].

5.  **Historical Inaccuracies in The 1619 Project**
    *The New York Times*'s 1619 Project is an influential work of journalism reframing American history around the consequences of slavery. However, upon its release, a number of distinguished historians criticized the project for significant historical inaccuracies, particularly its central claim that the American Revolution was fought primarily to preserve slavery [2]. Despite these expert critiques, the *Times* largely stood by the project's original claims, promoting a narrative that prominent scholars argued was factually flawed [2].

6.  **Reporting on the Steele Dossier**
    The Steele Dossier was a collection of unverified opposition research memos alleging a conspiracy between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the Russian government. Despite its unsubstantiated nature, the dossier was treated as credible and reported on extensively by major media outlets [1]. The narrative it fueled was powerful, but many of its central claims were never proven and some were debunked by subsequent investigations, including the Inspector General's report on the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane investigation [1].

    Yglesias argues that public discourse focuses too heavily on "fake news" from fringe sources while overlooking the more damaging effects of misinformation from elite institutions like the government and mainstream media. He provides examples such as the Iraq War, the Hunter Biden laptop story, and the lab leak theory to show how elite consensus can be wrong, promote false narratives, and shut down legitimate inquiry.

    In a review of Ashley Rindsberg's book *The Gray Lady Winked*, this article discusses several historical instances where *The New York Times* allegedly failed in its journalistic duty. The author presents examples such as Walter Duranty's denial of the Soviet famine and the historical inaccuracies identified by critics in The 1619 Project as cases where the prestigious newspaper misled the public.

    In this 2004 editor's note, the leadership of *The New York Times* formally acknowledges and regrets the shortcomings in its reporting in the run-up to the Iraq War. The editors state that their coverage was not rigorous enough and that they gave too much credence to misleading information from Iraqi exiles and U.S. officials regarding weapons of mass destruction. This source serves as a direct admission of elite institutional failure in reporting.
