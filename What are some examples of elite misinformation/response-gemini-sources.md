Elite misinformation refers to misleading or inaccurate information that originates not from fringe sources or foreign actors, but from credentialed and influential figures and institutions, such as politicians, academics, and established media outlets [1]. Unlike disinformation, which is often intentionally false, elite misinformation can be a product of motivated reasoning, ideological conformity, flawed framing, or the significant omission of facts [1, 4].

Examples of elite misinformation identified in the provided sources span foreign policy, domestic politics, social issues, and science.

### Foreign Policy and National Security
*   **The Iraq War:** The 2003 invasion of Iraq was preceded by a near-unanimous consensus among political and media elites that Saddam Hussein's regime possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). This consensus, which heavily influenced public support for the war, was based on flawed intelligence that was promoted with great confidence by top officials and largely accepted uncritically by major news outlets [8].

### Domestic Politics and Media Coverage
*   **Coverage of the Trump Administration:** Some analysis suggests that the media's intense focus on the "Russiagate" narrative, while rooted in real events, crowded out other important coverage and at times led to overstatement and a loss of perspective. The Columbia Journalism Review noted that the media's adversarial posture against President Trump, while understandable, sometimes undermined its credibility by making every issue a battle for its own legitimacy [1, 10].
*   **Coverage of the Biden Administration:** Critic Nate Silver argues that mainstream media coverage of the Biden presidency created a misleadingly negative picture of the economy, a phenomenon he terms a "vibecession." He contends that by overemphasizing lagging indicators like polls and voter sentiment while downplaying strong economic data (like low unemployment and GDP growth), the media constructed a narrative of failure that did not fully align with objective reality [6].
*   **Suppression of Contrarian Narratives:** A former senior editor at NPR stated that the organization's staff actively suppressed or dismissed certain stories that did not fit a progressive worldview. He cites the handling of the Hunter Biden laptop story—which was initially dismissed as Russian disinformation—and the COVID-19 lab-leak theory as examples where an internal ideological filter prevented objective reporting and misinformed the public [4].

### Social and Cultural Issues
*   **Youth Gender Medicine:** A "liberal misinformation bubble" has allegedly formed around the topic of medical care for transgender youth. *The Atlantic* reports that prominent media outlets and professional organizations in the United States have promoted a strong consensus in favor of the "affirmation-only" model of care. In doing so, they have often ignored or downplayed evidence from systematic reviews by European health authorities in countries like the UK, Sweden, and Finland, which have urged more caution and led to policy reversals abroad [12].
*   **UK Grooming Gangs:** For years, authorities and media outlets in the United Kingdom were reluctant to report on the disproportionate number of perpetrators of Pakistani origin in child-sexual-exploitation gangs in towns like Rotherham and Rochdale. A 2020 Home Office report concluded that fears of being labeled racist hampered the response from police and social services, constituting a massive failure to protect vulnerable children and a cover-up of the problem's full scope [9].
*   **Education Journalism:** Some critics assert that elite education journalism is frequently driven more by ideology than by empirical evidence. This leads to the promotion of educational fads and reforms that align with a particular political worldview but lack rigorous data to support their effectiveness, ultimately misinforming the public about what works in schools [7].

### Science and the Environment
*   **"Highbrow" Climate Misinformation:** This form of misinformation does not involve denying climate change but rather misdirecting the conversation around it. Examples include promoting climate "doomerism"—the idea that it is too late to do anything—or focusing public attention on low-impact individual actions, such as banning plastic straws. Critics argue this distracts from the systemic, policy-level changes that are necessary to address the crisis effectively [5].

These examples illustrate how elite misinformation often works by shaping narratives, framing issues in a particular way, and omitting key context, which can erode public trust in cornerstone institutions like the media and government [2, 3, 11].
