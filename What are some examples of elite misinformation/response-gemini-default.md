Elite misinformation refers to the dissemination of false or misleading information by individuals or institutions holding positions of significant power, authority, or influence, such as government officials, corporate leaders, and prominent media figures. This form of misinformation is particularly potent because these elites have access to large platforms and are often perceived by the public as credible and authoritative sources [1]. Their pronouncements can shape public opinion, influence policy, and have far-reaching, tangible consequences.

It is important to distinguish between misinformation (the sharing of false information, regardless of intent) and disinformation (the deliberate creation and sharing of false information with the intent to deceive). While the intent of an elite figure can be difficult to prove, the examples below involve cases where information presented as factual by influential sources was later proven to be false or fundamentally misleading, leading to significant societal impact.

Here are some prominent examples of elite misinformation:

### 1. The Rationale for the 2003 Iraq War

A frequently cited example of elite misinformation is the case made for the 2003 invasion of Iraq by senior officials in the United States and United Kingdom governments. The primary justification for the war was the claim that Saddam Hussein's regime possessed an active weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program that posed an imminent threat to global security.

*   **The Misinformation:** High-level officials, including U.S. President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, repeatedly asserted with great certainty that Iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons and was actively pursuing a nuclear program [2]. A key moment was the February 2003 United Nations presentation by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, where he presented intelligence, including satellite images and communications intercepts, as "irrefutable" evidence of Iraq's WMD capabilities and ties to al-Qaeda [3].
*   **The Elites:** The information was disseminated by the highest levels of the U.S. and U.K. governments and amplified by supportive media outlets.
*   **The Reality and Impact:** After the invasion, extensive searches found no evidence of an active WMD program. Subsequent investigations, such as the U.K.'s Chilcot Report, concluded that the certainty with which the intelligence was presented to the public was not justified by the evidence available at the time. The report stated that "the judgements about the severity of the threat posed by Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction... were presented with a certainty that was not justified" [4]. This misinformation led to a protracted war with hundreds of thousands of casualties and profound geopolitical instability in the Middle East [5].

### 2. The Tobacco Industry's Campaign of Doubt

For decades, executives and scientists connected to major tobacco companies engaged in a sophisticated campaign to obscure the scientific consensus about the dangers of smoking. This represents a classic case of corporate elite misinformation designed to protect profits at the expense of public health.

*   **The Misinformation:** Beginning in the 1950s, as evidence mounted linking smoking to lung cancer, tobacco companies funded their own research institutes and public relations campaigns. They did not need to prove that smoking was safe; they only needed to create the illusion of a continuing scientific debate [6]. Their key message was that there was "no proof" of a causal link and that more research was needed, a tactic designed to sow doubt and delay regulation. A famous 1954 advertisement, "A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers," published by major tobacco companies, promised to prioritize public health and support independent research, while the industry simultaneously worked to undermine and discredit legitimate science [7].
*   **The Elites:** The campaign was orchestrated by tobacco industry executives, lawyers, and public relations firms, who hired scientists to produce research favorable to their position.
*   **The Reality and Impact:** The scientific evidence for the harms of smoking was already substantial and grew overwhelmingly strong over time. The industry's campaign of doubt successfully delayed meaningful public health regulations, such as warning labels, advertising bans, and indoor smoking restrictions, for decades. This resulted in millions of preventable deaths and illnesses worldwide [6].

### 3. Claims of Widespread Fraud in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election

Following the 2020 U.S. presidential election, a coordinated and sustained campaign was launched by the incumbent president and his allies to claim the election was stolen through massive, widespread fraud. This has been widely referred to as "the Big Lie."

*   **The Misinformation:** Then-President Donald Trump and his surrogates made numerous specific but unsubstantiated allegations, including that voting machines had switched votes, that large numbers of dead people had voted, and that election workers had committed fraud [8]. These claims were repeated consistently across rallies, social media, and sympathetic news networks.
*   **The Elites:** The misinformation originated with the sitting U.S. President and was amplified by a large number of elected officials, political candidates, and media personalities.
*   **The Reality and Impact:** Dozens of lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign and its allies were dismissed by courts across the country, including by judges appointed by President Trump himself, due to a lack of evidence [9]. Election officials from both political parties, as well as the federal government's own Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), declared the 2020 election "the most secure in American history" [10]. This elite-driven misinformation campaign severely eroded public trust in the democratic process, particularly among a segment of the population, and was a primary driver of the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol [11].

### 4. Promotion of Unproven COVID-19 Treatments

During the COVID-19 pandemic, several elite figures, including political leaders and media personalities, promoted unproven and sometimes dangerous treatments for the virus, directly contradicting the advice of mainstream public health experts.

*   **The Misinformation:** One of the most prominent examples was the promotion of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a "game changer" cure for COVID-19. Despite a lack of robust scientific evidence, it was repeatedly touted by political leaders in the U.S. and Brazil [12].
*   **The Elites:** The promotion was led by figures such as U.S. President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and was amplified by television hosts and influencers on social media.
*   **The Reality and Impact:** The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initially granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the drug but later revoked it after multiple large-scale, randomized controlled trials showed that hydroxychloroquine was ineffective against COVID-19 and could cause serious heart-related side effects [13]. The promotion of an unproven drug created confusion, sowed distrust in scientific institutions like the FDA and CDC, and led to shortages of the drug for patients who needed it for approved uses, such as treating lupus and rheumatoid arthritis [12, 14].
