Elite misinformation refers to the dissemination of false or misleading information by individuals or institutions holding positions of significant power, authority, and public trust. This can include political leaders, high-ranking government officials, corporate executives, and influential media figures. Unlike grassroots misinformation, which spreads organically among the public, elite misinformation leverages established platforms and perceived credibility to shape public opinion, justify policy decisions, and maintain power. Its impact is often more significant due to the scale and authority of its sources [1].

Here are some prominent examples of elite misinformation across different domains.

### 1. Political and Military Justifications

A primary area for elite misinformation involves creating public support for military action or significant policy shifts.

*   **The Justification for the 2003 Invasion of Iraq:** A quintessential example is the claim by senior officials in the U.S. and U.K. governments that Iraq, under Saddam Hussein, possessed an active weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program that posed an imminent threat. Key elites, including U.S. President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, repeatedly made this assertion. The most famous presentation of this case was Secretary of State Colin Powell's February 2003 speech to the United Nations Security Council, where he presented intelligence that was later found to be inaccurate or exaggerated [2]. Despite UN inspectors finding no conclusive evidence, the narrative was powerful enough to build a coalition and garner public support for the invasion. Post-invasion investigations, including the Iraq Survey Group's final report, concluded that Iraq did not have a stockpile of WMDs [3]. This misinformation led to a prolonged and costly war, regional instability, and a significant erosion of public trust in government institutions.

*   **The Gulf of Tonkin Incident:** In August 1964, the administration of U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson claimed that North Vietnamese patrol boats had launched an "unprovoked" attack on the USS Maddox and a second, subsequent attack on the USS Turner Joy in the Gulf of Tonkin. While the first incident was a genuine naval engagement, evidence of the second alleged attack was highly dubious and likely based on misinterpreted radar signals [4]. Nevertheless, President Johnson and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara presented the events to Congress and the public as clear acts of aggression. This narrative led directly to the near-unanimous passage of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted Johnson the authority to use conventional military force in Southeast Asia without a formal declaration of war, vastly escalating the Vietnam War [5].

### 2. Public Health and Science

Elites can also spread misinformation that has severe consequences for public health and the scientific consensus on critical issues.

*   **The Tobacco Industry's Campaign of Doubt:** For decades, major tobacco companies engaged in a sophisticated, well-funded campaign to obscure the scientific evidence linking smoking to lung cancer and other diseases. Executives at leading tobacco firms, along with public relations experts and scientists they hired, deliberately manufactured uncertainty. A famous 1969 internal memo from one tobacco company executive stated, "Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public" [6]. These elites funded their own research designed to produce confusing results, lobbied against regulations, and publicly insisted the case against smoking was not closed. This misinformation campaign successfully delayed public health policies and was responsible for millions of deaths [7].

*   **Downplaying the COVID-19 Pandemic:** In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, some world leaders and influential figures publicly downplayed the virus's severity. For instance, U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly compared COVID-19 to the seasonal flu, suggested it would "miraculously go away," and promoted unproven treatments like hydroxychloroquine [8]. Similarly, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro dismissed the virus as a "little flu" and actively discouraged public health measures like social distancing. This misinformation from the highest levels of government created confusion, undermined the work of public health experts, and contributed to a delayed and less effective pandemic response in their respective countries, leading to higher rates of infection and death [9].

### 3. Electoral Processes

Misinformation from elites can be used to undermine faith in democratic institutions, particularly elections.

*   **Claims of Widespread Fraud in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election:** Following his defeat in the 2020 election, President Donald Trump and his close allies launched a sustained campaign claiming the election was stolen through widespread voter fraud. This narrative, often referred to as "The Big Lie," was promoted despite the fact that numerous court cases (over 60) were dismissed for lack of evidence and that election security officials, including Trump's own Attorney General and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), declared the 2020 election the "most secure in American history" [10]. This elite-driven misinformation directly fueled the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and has caused a lasting and deep-seated distrust in the American electoral system among a significant portion of the population [11].

    *   **Author's View:** The authors argue that elite-driven, partisan media (particularly on the right) is a more significant driver of misinformation than foreign interference or "fake news" from the fringes. They emphasize how figures with authority and large platforms set the agenda and shape the narratives that the public consumes, making elite misinformation particularly potent.
