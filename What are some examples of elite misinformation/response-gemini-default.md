Elite misinformation refers to the dissemination of false or misleading information by individuals or institutions holding positions of power and influence, such as government officials, corporate leaders, media figures, and other prominent public actors [1]. Unlike misinformation that spreads organically from the grassroots, elite misinformation is particularly damaging because it leverages the authority, credibility, and vast resources of the source to shape public opinion, policy, and historical narratives, often to serve a political, economic, or ideological agenda [2].

Below are several examples of elite misinformation across different domains.

### 1. Political and Governmental Misinformation

This category involves government officials or political leaders using their platforms to spread falsehoods to justify policy, consolidate power, or undermine democratic processes.

*   **The justification for the 2003 Iraq War:** Leading up to the invasion of Iraq, high-level officials in the United States and United Kingdom governments, including U.S. President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, repeatedly claimed that Iraq possessed an active weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program and had ties to al-Qaeda [3]. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell delivered a high-profile presentation to the UN Security Council in February 2003 detailing supposed evidence of these programs. Subsequent investigations, including the Iraq Survey Group's final report, found no evidence of WMD stockpiles or an active program [4]. The Senate Intelligence Committee later concluded that many of the pre-war intelligence assessments were "overstated, or were not supported by, the underlying intelligence" and that the administration's public statements were often not supported by the available intelligence [5]. This misinformation was instrumental in building public and international support for a war that had profound and lasting consequences.

*   **Claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election:** Following the 2020 U.S. presidential election, then-President Donald Trump and his close allies initiated a sustained campaign claiming the election was stolen through massive, coordinated voter fraud [6]. These claims were made from the highest office in the country and amplified by allied media and political figures. Despite these repeated assertions, a comprehensive review by the Associated Press found fewer than 475 potential cases of voter fraud out of 25.5 million votes cast in the six key states disputed by Trump, a number insufficient to have altered the election's outcome [7]. The administration's own top cybersecurity official, Christopher Krebs, declared the 2020 election "the most secure in American history" [8]. Dozens of lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign and its allies were dismissed by courts across the country due to a lack of evidence [6]. This campaign of misinformation eroded trust in the democratic process and was a primary catalyst for the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol [9].

### 2. Economic and Corporate Misinformation

This involves corporations and industry leaders misleading the public and regulators about the safety of their products or their impact on society and the environment to protect profits.

*   **The tobacco industry's denial of smoking's health risks:** For decades, major tobacco companies engaged in a coordinated campaign to deliberately mislead the public about the dangers of smoking and the addictive nature of nicotine. In 1954, they published "A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers" in major U.S. newspapers, claiming public health was their primary concern and that there was no scientific consensus on the harms of smoking [10]. They funded their own research institutes, such as the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, to create scientific doubt and counter the growing body of independent research showing a direct link between smoking and cancer [11]. Internal industry documents later revealed that these companies knew about the carcinogenic and addictive properties of their products for years while publicly denying them [12]. This campaign of misinformation is credited with delaying public health regulations and causing millions of preventable deaths [11].

*   **The fossil fuel industry and climate change denial:** Since the late 1970s, major fossil fuel companies like ExxonMobil had internal research that accurately predicted the warming effects of carbon dioxide emissions from their products [13]. Despite these internal findings, many of these companies spent decades and millions of dollars funding a sophisticated public relations campaign to manufacture uncertainty about climate science and delay climate action [14]. This included funding think tanks and scientists who were skeptical of climate change, lobbying against environmental regulations, and running advertisements that highlighted the "uncertainties" of climate models while promoting the economic necessity of fossil fuels. This strategy, similar to the tobacco industry's playbook, successfully muddied public perception and stalled meaningful policy responses to a growing global crisis [13, 14].

*   **Purdue Pharma and the marketing of OxyContin:** In the late 1990s, Purdue Pharma launched an aggressive marketing campaign for its new opioid painkiller, OxyContin. A key part of this campaign was the claim, promoted by company leaders and their sales representatives to doctors, that the risk of addiction to OxyContin was "less than one percent" [15]. This figure was based on a dubious and misapplied citation. The company heavily promoted this misinformation to encourage widespread prescription, even for moderate pain. In reality, the drug was highly addictive, and its proliferation fueled the opioid epidemic in the United States, which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths [16]. Purdue Pharma later pleaded guilty to criminal charges for fraudulently marketing the drug and misbranding it as less addictive than other painkillers [15].

### 3. Media and Public Discourse Misinformation

This involves influential media organizations or personalities using their platforms to spread falsehoods, often by amplifying narratives from other elites or creating their own.

*   **Promotion of unproven COVID-19 treatments:** During the COVID-19 pandemic, some prominent media figures and political commentators with large audiences repeatedly promoted unproven or disproven treatments, such as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, as cures for the virus [17]. These claims often contradicted the consensus of major global health organizations and the vast majority of the scientific community. For example, prominent cable news hosts and online influencers championed these drugs based on flimsy or fraudulent studies, creating false hope and leading some individuals to forego proven medical treatments or engage in dangerous self-medication [18]. This form of misinformation sowed confusion, undermined public health officials, and politicized the medical response to the pandemic [17].
