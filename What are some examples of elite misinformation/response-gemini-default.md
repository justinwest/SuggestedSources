Elite misinformation refers to false or misleading information spread by individuals or institutions holding significant social, political, economic, or cultural power. These "elites" can include politicians, high-ranking government officials, corporate leaders, and prominent media figures. Because of their authority and access to mass communication channels, misinformation originating from these sources can be particularly damaging, shaping public opinion, influencing policy, and eroding trust in key institutions [1].

Unlike general misinformation, which can originate from anyone, elite misinformation leverages a platform of perceived credibility. Many of the most consequential examples are more accurately described as *disinformation*â€”false information spread with the intent to deceive. Below are several prominent examples categorized by their source.

### 1. Political and Governmental Misinformation

This category involves false or misleading claims made by elected officials and government bodies to achieve political goals, justify policy decisions, or maintain power.

*   **Iraq's "Weapons of Mass Destruction" (2002-2003):** Perhaps one of the most cited examples of elite misinformation, the George W. Bush administration, including President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and Secretary of State Colin Powell, repeatedly claimed that Iraq possessed an active weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program. In his 2003 address to the UN Security Council, Powell presented intelligence, including satellite photos and informant reports, as "irrefutable" evidence [2]. This narrative was the central justification for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. However, subsequent investigations, including the Iraq Survey Group's final report, found no evidence of an active WMD program, concluding that Iraq's capabilities had been largely destroyed after the 1991 Gulf War [3]. The misinformation stemmed from a combination of flawed intelligence, cherry-picking data that supported a predetermined conclusion, and making definitive public statements that went far beyond what the intelligence community could actually confirm [2].

*   **"The Big Lie" and the 2020 U.S. Election:** Following the 2020 U.S. presidential election, President Donald Trump and his allies launched a coordinated campaign to spread the false claim that the election was stolen through widespread fraud [4]. Despite numerous state-level audits, recounts, and over 60 court cases finding no evidence of fraud on a scale that could have altered the outcome, these elites continued to promote the narrative through rallies, press conferences, and social media [5]. This misinformation directly incited the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and has led to a significant, lasting decline in a portion of the public's faith in the American electoral system [4, 5].

*   **Misinformation on the COVID-19 Pandemic:** Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, various political elites around the world spread misinformation that downplayed the virus's severity or promoted unproven treatments. For instance, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro repeatedly called COVID-19 a "little flu" and actively promoted the use of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, as a cure, despite scientific studies showing it was ineffective against the virus and could have dangerous side effects [6]. Similarly, President Trump also promoted hydroxychloroquine and publicly speculated about unscientific remedies, contributing to public confusion and politicizing public health measures [7].

### 2. Corporate and Industrial Misinformation

This type involves corporations and industry groups spreading misleading information to protect profits, avoid regulation, and shape public perception of their products or activities.

*   **The Tobacco Industry's Denial of Smoking Risks:** For decades, major tobacco companies engaged in a sophisticated disinformation campaign to obscure the scientific consensus that smoking causes cancer and other diseases. In 1954, they published "A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers" in newspapers across the U.S., claiming that there was "no proof" of a link between smoking and cancer and promising to fund independent research [8]. In reality, their internal documents later revealed they knew about the carcinogenic and addictive nature of their products for years. They funded biased research, created front groups, and hired public relations experts to manufacture doubt and delay public health regulations for decades [9].

*   **The Fossil Fuel Industry and Climate Change Denial:** Following a playbook similar to Big Tobacco's, some major oil and gas companies have been accused of funding a decades-long campaign to sow doubt about climate change and its causes. Internal documents from companies like ExxonMobil show that their own scientists were aware of the role of fossil fuels in causing global warming as early as the 1970s [10]. Despite this, the company and its affiliates funded think tanks, lobby groups, and scientists who promoted uncertainty and attacked the scientific consensus on climate change. This effort successfully delayed significant political action on climate change by creating a public perception of scientific disagreement where there was very little [11].

### 3. Media-Driven Misinformation

While often acting as vectors for other elite misinformation, media institutions and personalities can also be the primary source, either by platforming falsehoods without sufficient challenge or by promoting misleading narratives themselves.

*   **"Both Sides" Framing of Settled Science:** For many years, a journalistic norm of presenting "both sides" of an issue led to a form of misinformation regarding climate change. Media outlets would host debates between a climate scientist and a climate denier, creating a false impression that the scientific community was evenly split on the issue. In reality, the overwhelming consensus (over 99%) of climate scientists agrees that humans are the primary cause of global warming [12]. This "balancing" practice amplified fringe views, misrepresented the state of scientific knowledge, and contributed to public confusion [1].

*   **Amplification of Unsubstantiated Claims:** Prominent media figures, particularly on cable news opinion shows and talk radio, have repeatedly provided a platform for elite misinformation, often presenting it as legitimate news or analysis. For example, during the "Big Lie" campaign, certain media hosts on networks like Fox News and Newsmax either repeated or failed to meaningfully challenge false claims of election fraud made by President Trump's legal team and allies [13]. This amplification gave the misinformation a veneer of credibility and exposed it to millions of viewers, embedding it more deeply in the public consciousness [4].
