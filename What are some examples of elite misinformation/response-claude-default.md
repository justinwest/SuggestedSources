Elite misinformation refers to false or misleading information deliberately spread by powerful individuals, institutions, or groups in positions of authority to serve their interests, maintain power, or shape public opinion. This phenomenon has occurred throughout history and continues to manifest in various forms today.

## Historical Examples

One of the most consequential examples of elite misinformation was the tobacco industry's decades-long campaign to obscure the health risks of smoking. Despite internal knowledge of smoking's dangers as early as the 1950s, tobacco companies funded misleading research, created doubt about scientific consensus, and marketed cigarettes as safe or even healthy [1]. This deliberate deception resulted in millions of preventable deaths and established a blueprint for corporate disinformation campaigns.

The lead industry similarly engaged in systematic misinformation about the dangers of lead exposure, particularly in gasoline and paint. For decades, industry leaders suppressed research, attacked scientists who raised concerns, and promoted lead products despite knowing their toxic effects on human health, especially in children [2].

## Government and Political Misinformation

Governments have frequently deployed misinformation to justify military actions or policies. The Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964, which was used to escalate U.S. involvement in Vietnam, was later revealed to have been significantly misrepresented to Congress and the public [3]. More recently, the claims about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that justified the 2003 invasion were based on flawed intelligence that was presented with unwarranted certainty [4].

Political elites across the spectrum have engaged in misinformation campaigns. This includes false claims about election integrity, misleading statements about economic policies and their impacts, and the spread of conspiracy theories that serve political purposes [5]. The "birther" conspiracy about President Obama's birthplace and false claims about the 2020 U.S. election results represent modern examples of elite-driven political misinformation [6].

## Corporate and Financial Misinformation

The 2008 financial crisis revealed extensive misinformation from financial institutions about the risks of mortgage-backed securities and other complex financial products. Rating agencies, banks, and other financial elites misrepresented the safety of these investments, contributing to a global economic collapse [7].

The fossil fuel industry has engaged in climate change misinformation campaigns since at least the 1970s, funding think tanks and research to create doubt about climate science despite their own internal research confirming the risks of greenhouse gas emissions [8]. Companies like ExxonMobil had sophisticated climate models decades ago but publicly promoted uncertainty about climate change [9].

## Media and Technology Sector Misinformation

Social media companies have been accused of spreading misinformation about their platforms' impacts on mental health, particularly among young users. Internal documents from Facebook (now Meta) revealed the company was aware of Instagram's negative effects on teenage girls' mental health while publicly downplaying these concerns [10].

News media organizations have also been implicated in spreading elite misinformation, whether through selective reporting, misleading framing, or outright fabrication. The phone hacking scandal involving News Corporation outlets in the UK demonstrated how media elites could manipulate information and violate privacy for profit [11].

## Public Health Misinformation

The opioid crisis provides a stark example of pharmaceutical industry misinformation. Companies like Purdue Pharma deliberately misled doctors and patients about the addictive nature of opioid painkillers, contributing to hundreds of thousands of deaths [12]. The company's executives knew about the addiction risks but marketed OxyContin as having low addiction potential.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, various forms of elite misinformation emerged, including some government officials downplaying the virus's severity, spreading false information about treatments, or making misleading claims about public health measures [13].

## Characteristics and Impact

Elite misinformation is particularly dangerous because it comes from trusted sources with significant platforms and resources. It often involves sophisticated strategies including funding think tanks, commissioning favorable research, using public relations firms, and leveraging media connections [14]. The impacts can be devastating, leading to unnecessary deaths, environmental destruction, economic losses, and erosion of public trust in institutions.

Understanding elite misinformation requires recognizing that it is not merely about individual false statements but often involves systematic campaigns that exploit information asymmetries between elites and the public. These campaigns frequently use techniques like manufacturing doubt, false balance in media coverage, and astroturfing (creating fake grassroots movements) [15].
