Elite misinformation refers to false or misleading information spread by individuals or institutions in positions of power, authority, or influence. Unlike grassroots misinformation, elite misinformation often has greater reach and credibility due to the status of its sources. Here are several documented examples across different domains:

## Political and Government Misinformation

Government officials have repeatedly disseminated false information to advance policy goals or maintain public support. The weapons of mass destruction (WMD) claims preceding the 2003 Iraq invasion represent a prominent case, where intelligence was presented with greater certainty than warranted [1]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, various political leaders made unsubstantiated claims about treatments, disease severity, and vaccine safety that contradicted scientific consensus [2].

Election-related misinformation from political elites has become particularly prevalent, with false claims about voting systems, mail-in ballot security, and election integrity being promoted by candidates and elected officials despite lacking credible evidence [3].

## Corporate and Industry Misinformation

Corporations have historically funded misinformation campaigns to protect business interests. The tobacco industry's decades-long effort to obscure the health risks of smoking, despite internal knowledge of these dangers, represents one of the most documented cases of corporate misinformation [4]. Similarly, fossil fuel companies funded climate change denial efforts while their own research confirmed human-caused global warming [5].

Pharmaceutical companies have also engaged in selective disclosure of research results, downplaying adverse effects or overselling benefits of their products [6].

## Academic and Expert Misinformation

While less common, academics and credentialed experts sometimes promote misleading information. This includes researchers who misrepresent data to support predetermined conclusions, or experts who speak authoritatively outside their areas of expertise [7]. The Andrew Wakefield study falsely linking vaccines to autism, published in The Lancet, exemplifies how academic credentials can lend unwarranted credibility to misinformation [8].

## Media Misinformation

News organizations and prominent journalists occasionally spread false information, whether through inadequate fact-checking, sensationalism, or ideological bias. This includes premature reporting of unverified claims during breaking news situations and the amplification of unsubstantiated allegations [9].

## Digital Platform and Tech Leader Misinformation

Social media executives and technology leaders have made misleading statements about their platforms' capabilities, data practices, and content moderation policies. This includes downplaying the spread of misinformation on their platforms or overstating their ability to detect and remove harmful content [10].

## Impact and Characteristics

Elite misinformation is particularly concerning because it:
- Carries institutional credibility that makes it more likely to be believed
- Has broader reach through established media and communication channels
- Can influence policy decisions and public behavior more significantly than grassroots misinformation
- Often receives less scrutiny due to source credibility bias [11]

The phenomenon demonstrates that misinformation is not solely a problem of uninformed masses but can originate from and be perpetuated by society's most powerful and educated individuals and institutions.
