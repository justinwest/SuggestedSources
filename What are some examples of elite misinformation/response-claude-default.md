Elite misinformation refers to false or misleading information spread by individuals or institutions in positions of power, authority, or high social status. Unlike grassroots misinformation, elite misinformation often has greater reach and credibility due to the perceived authority of its sources. Here are several documented examples across different domains:

## Political and Government Misinformation

Political leaders have frequently disseminated false information to advance policy goals or maintain power. The Iraq War provides a prominent example, where senior U.S. officials made claims about weapons of mass destruction that proved unfounded [1]. More recently, claims about widespread electoral fraud in the 2020 U.S. presidential election were promoted by high-ranking officials despite lack of supporting evidence [2].

During the COVID-19 pandemic, some political leaders downplayed the severity of the virus or promoted unproven treatments, contradicting public health experts [3]. These statements carried significant weight due to the officials' positions of authority.

## Corporate and Industry Misinformation

Corporations have historically spread misinformation to protect business interests. The tobacco industry's decades-long campaign to obscure the health risks of smoking represents a well-documented case of elite misinformation [4]. Despite internal knowledge of smoking's dangers, tobacco companies funded research designed to create doubt about the scientific consensus.

Similarly, some fossil fuel companies have been accused of spreading misinformation about climate change despite internal research confirming human-caused global warming [5]. This involved funding think tanks and researchers who questioned established climate science.

## Media and Information Platforms

Media organizations and prominent journalists can become sources of elite misinformation when they fail to verify information or promote unfounded theories. The promotion of unsubstantiated claims about vaccine safety by some media personalities exemplifies this phenomenon [6].

Social media platforms, while not traditional elites, wield enormous influence over information flow. Their algorithmic choices and content moderation decisions can amplify or suppress certain narratives, sometimes inadvertently promoting misinformation [7].

## Academic and Expert Misinformation

Even academic institutions and credentialed experts can spread misinformation, though this is less common. Cases include researchers who have promoted scientifically unsupported theories about vaccines or climate change, leveraging their credentials to lend credibility to questionable claims [8].

## Consequences and Characteristics

Elite misinformation tends to be particularly harmful because it:
- Carries the credibility of authoritative sources
- Reaches large audiences through established platforms
- Can influence policy decisions and public behavior
- Often requires significant resources and expertise to counter effectively

The impact extends beyond immediate false beliefs, potentially undermining trust in institutions and democratic processes when elites are revealed to have spread misinformation [9].
