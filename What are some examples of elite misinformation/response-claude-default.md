Elite misinformation refers to false or misleading information that originates from or is amplified by individuals, institutions, or organizations in positions of authority, expertise, or significant social influence. Unlike grassroots misinformation, elite misinformation carries particular weight due to the credibility and reach of its sources.

## Government and Political Leaders

Political elites have been documented as significant sources of misinformation across various contexts. Research shows that political leaders often spread false claims about electoral processes, policy outcomes, and opponents [1]. High-profile examples include false claims about election integrity, exaggerated statements about policy effectiveness, and misleading characterizations of scientific evidence during public health crises [2].

Government officials may also engage in strategic misinformation campaigns, particularly during wartime or international conflicts, where propaganda and disinformation become tools of statecraft [3]. This includes false flag operations, denial of documented events, and manipulation of casualty figures or military capabilities.

## Corporate Misinformation

Corporations have historically engaged in systematic misinformation campaigns to protect their interests. The tobacco industry's decades-long campaign to obscure the health risks of smoking represents one of the most well-documented cases of corporate misinformation [4]. Internal documents revealed coordinated efforts to fund research that would cast doubt on the scientific consensus linking smoking to cancer.

Similarly, fossil fuel companies have been shown to have funded climate change denial despite their own internal research confirming anthropogenic climate change [5]. These campaigns involved funding think tanks, supporting contrarian scientists, and creating public doubt about established climate science.

The pharmaceutical industry has also been implicated in misinformation campaigns, including downplaying addiction risks of opioid medications and exaggerating the benefits of certain treatments while minimizing side effects [6].

## Academic and Scientific Misconduct

While less common, misinformation can originate from academic and scientific elites through research fraud, selective data presentation, or premature claims about research findings. High-profile cases include fabricated data in medical research, particularly in studies that could influence public health policy [7].

The phenomenon of "white coat misinformation" has gained attention, where individuals with medical or scientific credentials make claims outside their expertise or contrary to scientific consensus, lending false credibility to misleading information [8].

## Media and Information Gatekeepers

Traditional media outlets, despite professional standards, can become sources of elite misinformation through biased reporting, failure to fact-check sources adequately, or amplification of false claims from other elite sources [9]. This includes sensationalized coverage of scientific studies, misrepresentation of statistical data, and false balance in reporting on settled scientific questions.

Social media platforms and their algorithms can amplify elite misinformation by giving greater reach to content from verified accounts or sources with large followings [10].

## Religious and Cultural Leaders

Religious and cultural elites may spread misinformation about health practices, scientific concepts, or social issues that conflict with their ideological positions. This can include false claims about vaccines, contraception, or evolutionary science [11].

## Consequences and Characteristics

Elite misinformation is particularly dangerous because it leverages existing trust in institutions and authority figures. It often involves sophisticated messaging strategies and can persist longer than grassroots misinformation due to the credibility of its sources [12]. The consequences can include undermined public trust in legitimate institutions, harmful policy decisions, and individual behaviors that cause harm to public health or safety.

Elite misinformation also demonstrates how misinformation is not always the result of ignorance or accident, but can be a strategic tool employed by those with resources and motivation to shape public opinion for their benefit [13].
