Elite misinformation refers to false or misleading claims originating from influential actors—such as government officials, major media organizations, and large corporations—whose prominence gives their statements outsized reach and credibility. Below are well-documented examples across domains, each substantiated by official inquiries, court rulings, or authoritative investigations.

Government and national security
- Iraq’s alleged weapons of mass destruction (2002–2003): Senior U.S. and U.K. officials asserted Iraq had active WMD programs. Post-war investigations found no stockpiles and concluded the case for war was presented with unjustified certainty. The UK’s Chilcot Inquiry found that the judgments were not justified by the available intelligence, and the U.S. Iraq Survey Group concluded Iraq had no deployable WMD stockpiles at the time of the invasion [1][2].
- Gulf of Tonkin, Vietnam (1964): U.S. officials cited a second North Vietnamese attack on U.S. ships to justify escalation. Later declassified analyses by the National Security Agency’s historian showed intelligence was misinterpreted or misrepresented; the second attack likely did not occur [3].
- MH17 shoot-down narratives (2014): Russian state outlets advanced multiple contradictory explanations to deflect blame for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17. A Dutch court later concluded a Russian-supplied Buk missile launched from separatist-controlled territory shot down the aircraft, rejecting alternative narratives as false [4].

Public health and medicine
- Tobacco industry denial of harms and addiction (1950s–2000s): Major cigarette companies funded campaigns to cast doubt on the link between smoking and disease and denied nicotine’s addictiveness. A U.S. federal court found the industry engaged in a decades-long racketeering enterprise to deceive the public. Internal memos (e.g., “Doubt is our product”) illustrate the strategy [5][6].
- Opioid marketing (1990s–2010s): Purdue Pharma falsely marketed OxyContin as less addictive than it is, downplaying risks to doctors and patients. The company and executives pleaded guilty in 2007 to misbranding; a 2020 federal resolution further detailed unlawful marketing that fueled the opioid epidemic [7][8].
- COVID-19 claims by political leaders (2020):
  - Disinfectant/“injection” remarks by the U.S. President at a White House briefing prompted warnings from health authorities about dangerous misuse of disinfectants [9].
  - Promotion of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment persisted even as the U.S. FDA revoked its emergency authorization for lack of benefit and potential harm, and WHO discontinued trial arms after finding no clinical benefit [10][12].
  - Brazil’s President publicly dismissed COVID-19 as a “little flu” while promoting unproven treatments, contrary to emerging scientific evidence and international guidance [11][12].

Climate and environment
- Fossil fuel industry and climate risk (1970s–present): Exxon’s internal scientists produced accurate climate projections decades ago, yet the company later publicly cast doubt on climate science and emphasized uncertainty. Peer-reviewed research and investigative reporting document the divergence between internal knowledge and public messaging [13][14].

Elections, media, and political communication
- Brexit “£350 million a week” claim (2016): The Vote Leave campaign’s claim that the UK sends £350m per week to the EU, earmarked for the NHS, was criticized by the UK Statistics Authority as a misuse of official statistics and shown by fact-checkers to be misleading (it ignored the rebate and other flows) [15][16].
- 2020 U.S. election fraud narratives amplified by a major cable network: A Delaware court ruled that certain claims about Dominion Voting Systems were false as a matter of law; the network later settled a defamation suit for $787.5 million. U.S. election-security officials had affirmed the election was the most secure in American history [17][18].

Why these examples matter
- High-impact channels: When elites misinform, the claims travel farther and shape public behavior and policy.
- Institutional corrections: Many examples are not merely contested—they were subsequently rejected by courts, official inquiries, or rigorous scientific evaluations.
- Cross-domain pattern: From war justifications to public health and climate, elite misinformation can inflict large social costs.
