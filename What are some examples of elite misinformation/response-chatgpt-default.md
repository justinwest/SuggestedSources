**Elite misinformation** refers to false or misleading claims spread by mainstream institutions or powerful public figures (the “elites”). Such misinformation often gains wide traction because it comes from authoritative sources and can significantly shape public opinion or policy ([www.slowboring.com](https://www.slowboring.com/p/elite-misinformation-is-an-underrated#:~:text=for%20example%2C%20one%20thing%20that,broad%20trajectory%20of%20American%20politics)). Below are a few notable examples of elite misinformation:

1. **Iraq War – Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Claims (2002–2003):**  A prime example is the U.S. and U.K. government claims that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction. Top officials and intelligence agencies asserted Iraq had an advanced nuclear or WMD program, which was used as a key justification for the 2003 invasion ([www.slowboring.com](https://www.slowboring.com/p/elite-misinformation-is-an-underrated#:~:text=that%20the%20misinformation%20police%20intend,broad%20trajectory%20of%20American%20politics)) ([www.weos.org](https://www.weos.org/2023-03-18/20-years-on-remembering-the-mess-of-misinformation-that-propelled-the-iraq-war#:~:text=HUANG%3A%20The%20U,Malone%2C%20welcome%20to%20the%20program)). In reality, no such stockpiles or active programs were found, making the WMD claim a **false pretext** for war ([www.weos.org](https://www.weos.org/2023-03-18/20-years-on-remembering-the-mess-of-misinformation-that-propelled-the-iraq-war#:~:text=HUANG%3A%20The%20U,Malone%2C%20welcome%20to%20the%20program)). This elite-driven misinformation had enormous consequences, contributing to a war that cost many lives and damaging public trust in government assertions. 

2. **False “Stolen” Election Claims in the 2020 U.S. Election:**  After the 2020 presidential election, President Donald Trump and some political allies repeatedly **claimed without evidence** that the election was “stolen” or tainted by widespread voter fraud. These claims – voiced by a sitting president and amplified by partisan media elites – constitute elite misinformation that undermined public confidence in the electoral process ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/c8c06eb608c1b1ae8ca0e93ec1022b02#:~:text=In%20a%20recent%20interview%20with,Additionally%2C%20both%20Republicans%20and)) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/c8c06eb608c1b1ae8ca0e93ec1022b02#:~:text=Democrats%20initially%20supported%20mail%20voting,largely%20free%20from%20significant%20fraud)). Extensive investigations, audits, and court rulings found *no significant fraud* that could have affected the outcome, confirming that the allegations were baseless ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/c8c06eb608c1b1ae8ca0e93ec1022b02#:~:text=In%20a%20recent%20interview%20with,Additionally%2C%20both%20Republicans%20and)) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/c8c06eb608c1b1ae8ca0e93ec1022b02#:~:text=Democrats%20initially%20supported%20mail%20voting,largely%20free%20from%20significant%20fraud)). Despite their falsity, the high-profile repetition of these claims contributed to polarized beliefs among millions of Americans.

3. **Climate Change Denial by Fossil Fuel Companies:**  Leading fossil fuel corporations, notably ExxonMobil, are documented to have **misled the public about climate change** despite knowing the scientific truth. Internal research by Exxon in the 1970s and 1980s accurately predicted the trajectory of global warming, yet the company spent decades publicly **casting doubt on climate science** and downplaying the link between fossil fuels and climate change ([www.latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-01-12/exxonmobil-accurately-predicted-effects-of-global-warming#:~:text=In%20perhaps%20the%20most%20unexpected,the%20burning%20of%20fossil%20fuels)). In other words, Exxon’s executives and allies ran a disinformation campaign to protect their interests – an elite-driven effort that stalled climate policy. A 2023 study revealed that Exxon's own scientists had excellent climate forecasts, even as the company’s public stance was to question or deny those findings ([www.latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-01-12/exxonmobil-accurately-predicted-effects-of-global-warming#:~:text=In%20perhaps%20the%20most%20unexpected,the%20burning%20of%20fossil%20fuels)). This example shows how corporate elites can propagate misinformation to shape public perception and policy.

4. **Tobacco Industry’s Denial of Smoking Risks:**  For decades, major tobacco companies engaged in systematic misinformation about the dangers of smoking. **Big Tobacco’s executives and PR teams repeatedly denied or obfuscated the health risks** of cigarettes – even though their own internal research had confirmed links to lung cancer and addiction. In the 1950s and 60s, tobacco firms sponsored biased research and ran ads claiming “no proof” that smoking causes cancer, calling their products safe ([exposetobacco.org](https://exposetobacco.org/news/tobacco-industry-lies/#:~:text=The%20tobacco%20industry%20had%20to,to%20cancer%20and%20were%20addictive)). This was deliberate elite misinformation: *industry leaders knew the truth but lied* to protect profits. As one report summarizes, “for decades, Big Tobacco publicly denied what it internally knew to be true,” using deceptive campaigns and even misleading policymakers under oath ([exposetobacco.org](https://exposetobacco.org/news/tobacco-industry-lies/#:~:text=For%20decades%2C%20Big%20Tobacco%20publicly,was%20causing%20to%20their%20bodies)). This misinformation delayed public health interventions and contributed to many preventable deaths.

Each of the above cases illustrates how **elite misinformation** – falsehoods promoted by those in power – can have far-reaching impacts. Whether to justify a war, dispute a democratic election, or defend an industry’s interests, misinformation from trusted high-level sources can mislead the public on a grand scale. These examples underscore the importance of skepticism and verification even when claims come from “official” or elite channels, as errors or falsehoods from the top can shape history.

The LA Times piece highlights the company’s elite misinformation: **Exxon knew the climate truth yet funded doubt** – delaying public awareness and policy action. It notes that from 1977 to 2003, Exxon's internal models foresaw global warming outcomes even more precisely than NASA’s, all while the company’s public stance was skeptical, misleading the public ([www.latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-01-12/exxonmobil-accurately-predicted-effects-of-global-warming#:~:text=In%20perhaps%20the%20most%20unexpected,the%20burning%20of%20fossil%20fuels)). *URL: <https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-01-12/exxonmobil-accurately-predicted-effects-of-global-warming>*

The source describes the industry’s “deceptive campaigns” – from funding biased research to making public statements like *“we believe the products we make are not injurious to health”* in a 1954 joint ad. The authors’ view is that tobacco companies deliberately spread misinformation, creating confusion and doubt about the dangers of smoking ([exposetobacco.org](https://exposetobacco.org/news/tobacco-industry-lies/#:~:text=For%20decades%2C%20Big%20Tobacco%20publicly,was%20causing%20to%20their%20bodies)) ([exposetobacco.org](https://exposetobacco.org/news/tobacco-industry-lies/#:~:text=The%20tobacco%20industry%20had%20to,to%20cancer%20and%20were%20addictive)). *URL: <https://exposetobacco.org/news/tobacco-industry-lies/>*
