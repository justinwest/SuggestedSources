**Elite misinformation** refers to false or misleading claims propagated by mainstream institutions or influential figures (government agencies, experts, major media), as opposed to fringe sources. Such misinformation can shape public opinion and policy on a large scale. Notable examples include: 

- **Iraq War WMD Claims (2002–2003):** In the lead-up to the Iraq War, U.S. intelligence agencies and top officials asserted that Iraq had active weapons of mass destruction programs (including an advanced nuclear program). This claim was untrue – extensive post-invasion searches found no such WMD stockpiles – but it was widely reported in elite media and believed by the public at the time [1]. The erroneous information, coming from authoritative sources, had enormous influence on public support and decision-making for the war [1].

- **Misinterpreted U.S. Maternal Mortality Spike:** Over the past decade, prominent health institutions and media outlets warned of a *“sharp rise”* in U.S. maternal mortality, depicting it as a worsening crisis. In reality, much of the reported increase was a statistical artifact from improved tracking methods rather than an actual decline in maternal health outcomes [1]. Critics noted that this nuance was often lost in mainstream discussions; some officials even resisted clarifying the misinterpretation, fearing that debunking the dramatic narrative would undermine advocacy efforts [1].

- **“$7 Trillion in Fossil Fuel Subsidies” Statistic:** Major news publications and environmental advocates have repeatedly cited a striking statistic that governments *“subsidize fossil fuels”* by **$5–7 trillion** annually. This figure, originating from an IMF report, is **highly misleading** – it counts *“implicit subsidies”* like not taxing carbon emissions as part of the total, even though these are not direct cash handouts [1]. By labeling the absence of a carbon tax as a **“subsidy,”** the report’s presentation created a sensational number that was widely amplified in the press. The result was a false impression that trillions in public funds were being directly given to oil and coal companies, skewing policy debates [1].

- **Alarmist Policy Predictions That Failed to Materialize:**  Elite discourse sometimes features dire forecasts to spur action, which later prove overblown. For example, in 2023 experts warned that the expiration of pandemic-era child-care subsidies in the U.S. would cause a *“systemic”* economic crisis – mass daycare closures, workforce breakdowns, etc. – yet no such collapse occurred after the subsidies lapsed [1]. Similarly, when federal **net neutrality** rules were repealed in 2017, many commentators predicted internet speeds would plummet and online services would suffer; in practice, the internet functioned about the same post-repeal, and the policy reversal went largely unnoticed by consumers [1]. These cases show how well-intentioned **catastrophic rhetoric** from respected voices can mislead the public when the worst-case scenarios don’t come true.

- **“Tax Cuts Pay for Themselves” Myth:** A long-standing example of elite-level misinformation in economic policy is the claim that major tax cuts (especially for businesses or the wealthy) will *“generate so much growth that they pay for themselves.”* This idea has been repeatedly promoted by prominent politicians and officials, despite abundant evidence to the contrary [1]. In case after case – from the Reagan era to recent state-level experiments – tax cuts have **widened budget deficits** rather than fully “paying for themselves,” a fact well documented by economists. Even so, the alluring narrative persists in mainstream political debate, illustrating how difficult it is to dispel convenient falsehoods endorsed by elites [1].

- **The 1619 Project’s “True Founding” Claim:** In 2019, *The New York Times* launched the high-profile **1619 Project**, whose introduction asserted that **1619** (the year African slaves were first brought to colonial America) was the nation’s “true founding,” supplanting **1776**. This provocative claim, presented as a factual reframing of U.S. history, drew immediate criticism from many historians who argued it was inaccurate. The Times eventually **quietly removed** or revised the wording in digital versions of the 1619 Project without a clear public explanation [2]. Publishing such a sweeping historical claim – and then stealth-editing it after backlash – exemplified how even prestigious media outlets can promulgate and perpetuate misleading information in pursuit of a bold narrative [2].

- **Early COVID-19 Mask Guidance:** At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, top public health officials in the U.S. (including the Surgeon General and Dr. Anthony Fauci) **discouraged people from wearing face masks**, suggesting masks were ineffective for the general public. This was **misleading advice** circulated by authorities, partly intended to prevent panic-buying of medical masks amid shortages [3]. Officials later admitted that masks *are* effective and shifted to recommending face coverings for everyone once supplies increased and evidence of asymptomatic spread grew [3]. The initial *“don’t wear masks”* messaging – coming from trusted experts – is a clear case of elite misinformation (however well-intentioned) that sowed confusion about a crucial public health measure.

Each of these examples shows that misinformation is not only a fringe phenomenon but can also originate from elites in government, academia, and the mainstream press. Whether through errors, misaligned incentives, or strategic spin, false narratives from authoritative sources can significantly influence public understanding and policy. Recognizing **elite misinformation** as a problem highlights the need to hold powerful institutions accountable for accuracy and honesty, just as we do fringe sources [1][2].

He gives examples such as the faulty pre-Iraq War intelligence on WMDs, a misconstrued rise in U.S. maternal mortality (due to changes in data collection), misleading claims of massive fossil-fuel “subsidies,” and exaggerated catastrophic predictions (like child-care funding cliffs and net neutrality fears that never came true) to illustrate how *“elite”* narratives can misinform the public. *(Link:* [slowboring.com](https://www.slowboring.com/p/elite-misinformation-is-an-underrated) *)*

2. **James Bennet – “When the New York Times lost its way” (*The Economist* 1843 magazine, 2023):** Bennet (a former NYT editor) critiques how leading media institutions can mislead or short-change readers under internal and external pressures. He recounts the uproar over a 2020 NYT op-ed by a U.S. senator (and how staff mischaracterized it), and points to the Times’s handling of the 1619 Project – including factual errors and stealth edits of its bold “true founding” claim – as signs that the paper prioritized certain narratives over straightforward truth. Bennet’s view is that American media should recommit to rigorous debate and trust readers with uncomfortable facts, rather than suppressing or subtly altering information. *(Link:* [economist.com](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/12/14/when-the-new-york-times-lost-its-way) *)*

Panetta explains that in Feb–Mar 2020, Fauci and other U.S. health officials advised against mask-wearing by the public due to severe PPE shortages for medical workers. Fauci later defended that advice as contextually appropriate but acknowledged it was based on limited information. The article highlights how that initial official guidance – now known to be flawed – was an example of authorities relaying information that, in hindsight, misled the public about masks’ effectiveness. *(Link:* [businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-doesnt-regret-advising-against-masks-early-in-pandemic-2020-7) *)*
