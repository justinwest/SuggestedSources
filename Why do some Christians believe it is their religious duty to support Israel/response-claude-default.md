# Why do some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel?

Many Christians who believe they have a religious duty to support Israel base this conviction on several theological and biblical interpretations:

## Biblical Covenant Theology

Central to this belief is the understanding of God's covenant with Abraham and his descendants. These Christians interpret Genesis 12:3, where God tells Abraham "I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse," as an ongoing promise that extends to modern Israel. They view supporting Israel as aligning themselves with God's will and securing divine blessing.

## Dispensationalist Eschatology

A significant portion of evangelical Christians adhere to dispensationalist theology, which sees biblical history as divided into distinct periods or "dispensations." This framework typically includes beliefs about:

- The restoration of Israel as a nation being prophetically significant
- Israel playing a crucial role in end-times events
- The eventual rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem
- Christ's future millennial reign from Jerusalem

From this perspective, the establishment of Israel in 1948 is viewed as fulfillment of biblical prophecy, making support for Israel participation in God's prophetic plan.

## Interpretation of Romans 9-11

Many Christians point to Paul's letters, particularly Romans 9-11, which discuss God's relationship with Israel. They interpret passages suggesting that God has not rejected His people and that there remains a future for ethnic Israel in God's plan. This theological position, often called "dual covenant" or "two-covenant" theology by some, maintains that God's promises to Israel remain valid alongside the New Covenant through Christ.

## Historical and Moral Considerations

Beyond theological reasons, many Christians support Israel due to:

- Recognition of historical persecution of Jewish people, including the Holocaust
- Viewing Israel as a democratic ally sharing Western values
- Concern for protecting Christian holy sites and communities in the region
- Belief that Christians have a moral obligation to stand with the Jewish people after centuries of Christian antisemitism

## Denominational and Regional Variations

This support is particularly strong among:
- Evangelical Protestant denominations
- Pentecostal and charismatic Christians
- Many fundamentalist Christian groups
- Certain Baptist and Presbyterian denominations

The phenomenon is especially prominent in the United States, where Christian Zionism has become a significant political and religious movement.

It's important to note that not all Christians share these views. Many mainline Protestant denominations, Eastern Orthodox churches, and some Catholic perspectives emphasize different theological interpretations that may lead to more neutral or critical positions regarding unconditional support for Israel. These alternative viewpoints often focus more on justice for all peoples in the region, including Palestinians, and emphasize the universal rather than ethnic aspects of God's covenant promises.
