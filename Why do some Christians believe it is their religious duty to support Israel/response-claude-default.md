Many Christians, particularly evangelical Protestants, believe supporting Israel is a religious duty based on several theological interpretations and biblical understandings that have developed over centuries.

## Biblical Covenant Theology

The primary foundation for this belief stems from God's covenant with Abraham in Genesis, where God promises to bless Abraham's descendants and make them a great nation [1]. Many Christians interpret Genesis 12:3, "I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse," as applying to modern Israel and the Jewish people. This leads them to believe that supporting Israel will result in God's blessing, while opposing Israel could bring divine judgment [2].

## Dispensationalism and End Times Prophecy

A significant theological framework driving Christian support for Israel is dispensationalism, which emerged in the 19th century through the teachings of John Nelson Darby and was popularized by the Scofield Reference Bible [3]. Dispensationalists believe that God has separate plans for Israel (the Jewish people) and the Church (Christians), and that biblical prophecies about Israel's restoration must be literally fulfilled [1].

This theology emphasizes that Israel's establishment in 1948 and control of Jerusalem since 1967 represent fulfillment of biblical prophecy, particularly passages like Ezekiel 37 (the valley of dry bones) and Jesus's statement in Luke 21:24 about Jerusalem no longer being "trampled by the Gentiles" [4]. Many dispensationalists believe Israel's restoration is a prerequisite for Christ's Second Coming [2].

## Christian Zionism

Christian Zionism, the organized movement supporting Jewish return to Palestine, actually predated modern political Zionism by decades [5]. Notable early Christian Zionists included Lord Shaftesbury in Britain and William Blackstone in America, who advocated for Jewish restoration to Palestine in the 1800s based on biblical prophecy [3].

Modern Christian Zionist organizations like Christians United for Israel (CUFI) mobilize millions of evangelicals to politically support Israel, arguing this represents obedience to biblical commands [6]. They often cite Romans 11, where Paul discusses God's continued covenant with the Jewish people, as evidence that Christians should support Jewish national aspirations [1].

## Guilt and Solidarity Over Historical Persecution

Some Christian support for Israel stems from recognition of Christianity's role in centuries of antisemitism and the Holocaust [7]. This creates a sense of moral obligation to protect and support the Jewish state as partial recompense for historical wrongs. The phrase "never again" resonates strongly with Christians who see supporting Israel as preventing future genocide [2].

## Theological Variations and Criticisms

Not all Christians share these views. Replacement theology (supersessionism) holds that the Church has replaced Israel in God's covenant, making special support for modern Israel unnecessary [8]. Many mainline Protestant denominations, Eastern Orthodox churches, and some Catholic perspectives emphasize that God's promises are fulfilled spiritually through Christ rather than through a political state [7].

Critics within Christianity argue that conflating modern Israel with biblical Israel is theologically problematic, and that unconditional support for any nation's policies contradicts Christian principles of justice and peace [8]. Palestinian Christians particularly challenge Christian Zionism, arguing it ignores their suffering and legitimate claims [9].

## Political and Cultural Factors

Beyond theology, cultural factors reinforce evangelical support for Israel, including shared democratic values, Israel's strategic alliance with the United States, and negative perceptions of Islam following events like 9/11 [10]. Conservative Christians often view Israel as a Western, democratic ally surrounded by hostile authoritarian regimes [6].

The influence of Christian Zionism on U.S. foreign policy has been substantial, with evangelical voters consistently ranking among Israel's strongest supporters in polling [10]. Organizations like CUFI claim millions of members and regularly lobby Congress for pro-Israel policies [6].

This complex intersection of biblical interpretation, historical guilt, prophetic belief, and political alignment explains why many Christians view Israel support as religiously mandated, even as other Christians reach different theological and political conclusions about the same issues.
