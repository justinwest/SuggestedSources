Many Christians, particularly white evangelicals, believe supporting Israel is a religious duty rooted in several theological and biblical interpretations that have developed over the past two centuries.

## Dispensationalist Theology

The primary theological foundation comes from dispensationalism, a Protestant theological framework that emerged in the 19th century through the work of John Nelson Darby and later popularized by the Scofield Reference Bible [1]. Dispensationalists interpret biblical prophecy literally and believe that God has separate covenantal relationships with Israel (as ethnic Jews) and the Christian church. According to this view, God's promises to the Jewish people regarding the land of Israel remain valid and will be fulfilled in the end times [1].

This theological system teaches that the modern state of Israel represents the fulfillment of biblical prophecy and that Christians should support Israel to align themselves with God's plan. Dispensationalists often point to Genesis 12:3, where God tells Abraham "I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse," interpreting this as a divine mandate to support the Jewish state [2].

## Biblical Literalism and Land Promises

Many evangelical Christians believe that God gave the land of Israel specifically to the Jewish people as an eternal inheritance. Pew Research found that more white evangelicals (82%) than American Jews (40%) believe that God gave Israel to the Jewish people [3]. This belief stems from a literal interpretation of Old Testament passages, particularly God's covenant with Abraham and his descendants regarding the Promised Land [3].

## Eschatological Beliefs

Christian support for Israel is also driven by end-times theology. Many evangelicals believe that the gathering of Jews in Israel and the restoration of the Jewish state are necessary preconditions for Christ's Second Coming [2]. According to this interpretation, supporting Israel helps advance God's prophetic timeline and brings the world closer to the culmination of history [1][2].

## Political and Cultural Factors

Beyond theological reasons, Christian support for Israel has been reinforced by political and cultural factors. The alliance between evangelical Christians and pro-Israel advocacy has created a powerful political constituency, particularly within the Republican Party [4]. This relationship has been strengthened by shared values around democracy, religious freedom, and opposition to Islamic extremism [2].

The concept of a "Judeo-Christian tradition" has also played a role, though some scholars argue this framework has become less relevant in contemporary discourse [5]. This cultural narrative positioned Christians and Jews as natural allies sharing common values and heritage.

## Institutional Support

Christian Zionism has become institutionalized through organizations, churches, and educational institutions that promote pro-Israel theology. This has created a self-reinforcing cycle where support for Israel becomes not just a theological position but a cultural marker of evangelical identity [2].

The influence of this movement extends beyond theology into practical politics, where evangelical support has become a significant factor in U.S. foreign policy toward Israel [4]. This political dimension has further entrenched the belief among many Christians that supporting Israel is both a religious duty and a patriotic obligation.
