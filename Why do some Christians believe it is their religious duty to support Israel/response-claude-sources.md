# Why do some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel?

Many Christians, particularly evangelical Protestants, believe it is their religious duty to support Israel based on several theological and eschatological foundations rooted in biblical interpretation.

## Biblical Covenant and Divine Promise

The primary theological basis stems from interpretations of biblical covenants, particularly God's promise to Abraham in Genesis. According to a 2013 Pew Research survey, 82% of white evangelicals believe that God gave the land of Israel to the Jewish people, compared to 40% of American Jews themselves [1]. This belief is grounded in what many evangelicals see as an unconditional and eternal covenant between God and the Jewish people regarding the land of Israel.

## Dispensationalist Theology and End Times Beliefs

A significant driver of Christian support for Israel comes from dispensationalist theology, which became prominent in American evangelicalism in the 19th and 20th centuries [2]. This theological framework holds that the establishment and preservation of Israel is essential to biblical prophecy and the Second Coming of Christ. Dispensationalists believe that the return of Jews to Israel and the restoration of the Jewish state are necessary precursors to end-times events, including the rapture and Christ's millennial reign.

## The "Judeo-Christian Tradition" Concept

The idea of a shared "Judeo-Christian tradition" has also influenced Christian support for Israel, though this concept has evolved significantly over time [3]. This framework emphasizes common values and shared heritage between Judaism and Christianity, leading many Christians to view supporting Israel as supporting their own religious and cultural foundations.

## Political and Cultural Factors

Beyond theological reasons, Christian support for Israel has been reinforced by political and cultural factors. The alliance between evangelical Christians and pro-Israel political movements has created a powerful lobbying force in American politics [4]. This relationship has been particularly evident in evangelical support for pro-Israel policies, with many evangelicals viewing such support as both a religious obligation and a patriotic duty.

## Contemporary Manifestations

This religious conviction has translated into significant political influence, with evangelical Christians often being among the strongest supporters of pro-Israel policies in American politics [2]. Their support typically extends beyond general diplomatic backing to include support for specific policies such as moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and supporting Israeli settlements in disputed territories.

The intersection of these theological beliefs with political action reflects how many Christians view their faith as requiring active support for Israel's security and prosperity, seeing this support as both biblically mandated and prophetically significant.
