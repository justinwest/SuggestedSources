# Why do some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel?

Some Christians, particularly evangelical Protestants, believe supporting Israel is their religious duty based on several theological and eschatological convictions that have developed over the past century.

**Biblical Covenant Theology**

Many evangelical Christians interpret biblical passages as establishing an eternal covenant between God and the Jewish people regarding the land of Israel. They view modern Israel as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy and believe that God's promises to Abraham and his descendants remain valid today [1]. This theological framework, known as Christian Zionism, sees the establishment of Israel in 1948 as a divinely ordained event that Christians should support.

**Eschatological Beliefs**

A significant factor driving Christian support for Israel stems from dispensationalist theology, which became popular among American evangelicals in the 19th and 20th centuries. According to this interpretation, the return of Jews to Israel and the restoration of a Jewish state are necessary preconditions for the Second Coming of Christ [1][2]. Many evangelical Christians believe they are witnessing the unfolding of biblical end-times prophecy and see supporting Israel as participating in God's plan for human history.

**"Blessing and Curse" Interpretation**

Many Christians cite Genesis 12:3, where God tells Abraham "I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse," as a mandate to support Israel and the Jewish people [1]. They interpret this as meaning that nations and individuals who support Israel will receive God's blessing, while those who oppose Israel will face divine judgment. This creates a sense of religious obligation to stand with Israel politically and materially.

**Influence of Christian Zionist Leaders**

Prominent evangelical leaders and organizations have reinforced these beliefs through teaching and political advocacy. Organizations like Christians United for Israel have mobilized millions of evangelical Christians to view support for Israel as a core religious duty [2]. These groups often frame opposition to Israel as opposition to God's will, making support for Israeli policies a test of Christian faithfulness.

**Political and Cultural Factors**

The alliance between evangelical Christians and pro-Israel advocacy has been strengthened by shared conservative political values and a sense of cultural affinity with Israel as a democratic ally in the Middle East [2]. Some evangelical leaders have explicitly connected support for Israel with broader conservative political positions, making it part of a comprehensive worldview that combines religious and political commitments.

**Contemporary Manifestations**

This religious conviction has translated into significant political influence, with evangelical Christians comprising one of the most reliable pro-Israel constituencies in American politics [2]. Their support often extends beyond general backing for Israel's existence to endorsement of specific policies, including settlement expansion and rejection of territorial concessions. Many evangelical Christians view criticism of Israeli policies as not merely political disagreement but as opposition to God's plan.

It's worth noting that not all Christians share these views, and some Christian denominations and leaders have criticized Christian Zionism as a misinterpretation of biblical texts [3]. However, among those who do hold these beliefs, support for Israel is seen not as a political preference but as a fundamental religious obligation rooted in their understanding of God's will and biblical prophecy.
