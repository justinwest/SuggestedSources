# Why do some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel?

A significant number of Christians, particularly within the American white evangelical community, believe supporting the state of Israel is a religious duty [5]. This conviction is not monolithic across Christianity but is rooted in a specific set of theological interpretations of the Bible, end-times prophecy, and a view of God's ongoing relationship with the Jewish people [1, 2].

The primary reasons for this belief are:

**1. The Abrahamic Covenant**
The foundational belief is that God's covenant with Abraham, and by extension the Jewish people, is eternal and unconditional. Proponents point to Genesis 12:3, where God says to Abram, "I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse" [1]. Adherents interpret this as a literal, ongoing command for individuals and nations to support the Jewish people and their claim to the land promised to them by God. A 2013 Pew Research poll found that 82% of white evangelicals believe God gave the land of Israel to the Jewish people, a higher percentage than American Jews themselves (40%) [5]. This conviction establishes a direct theological mandate to stand with Israel to receive God's blessing and avoid his curse [1].

**2. Dispensational Premillennialism and End-Times Prophecy**
A prominent theological framework among these Christians is "dispensational premillennialism," an interpretive lens for biblical prophecy that was widely popularized in the early 20th century by the Scofield Reference Bible [2]. This framework divides history into different "dispensations," or eras, of God's work. According to this view:
*   The modern state of Israel, established in 1948, is a direct fulfillment of biblical prophecies, such as those in Ezekiel and Isaiah [1, 2].
*   The "gathering" of the Jewish people back to their ancestral homeland is a necessary precondition for the final series of end-times events, including the Tribulation, the Battle of Armageddon, and the Second Coming of Jesus Christ [2].
*   Therefore, supporting Israel's existence, security, and sovereignty is not just a political stance but a way of participating in and hastening God's prophetic plan for humanity's final chapter [1, 4]. This belief system imbues political events, like the U.S. moving its embassy to Jerusalem, with profound prophetic significance [2].

**3. Rejection of "Replacement Theology"**
Christian supporters of Israel explicitly reject a doctrine known as "replacement theology" or "supersessionism" [1]. This is the historic Christian belief that the Christian Church has replaced Israel as God's chosen people and inherited the covenants and promises once made to the Jewish nation. In contrast, Christian Zionists believe God has a distinct and ongoing plan for Israel and the Jewish people that has not been nullified by the Church. They see God's promises of land and blessing to Israel as literal and everlasting, making the preservation of the Jewish state a theological imperative [1].

**4. The "Judeo-Christian Tradition" and Political Alliance**
On a political and cultural level, this theological support is often framed within the context of a shared "Judeo-Christian tradition" [3]. While some scholars argue this term is a relatively modern political construct created to unite Americans against secularism or communism, it has become a powerful rallying cry for a conservative political alliance. This alliance views Israel as a fellow democracy and a bulwark against common enemies in the Middle East [3]. This theological conviction translates into potent political action. Christian Zionists are considered a "critical component" of the pro-Israel lobby in the United States, using their significant numbers and organizational power to influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of strong support for Israel [4].

1.  **Weber, Timothy P. "Evangelicals and Israel." *Christian Century*.** Weber explains the theological underpinnings of evangelical support for Israel, focusing on dispensationalism and the interpretation of the Abrahamic covenant (Genesis 12:3). He contrasts this with "replacement theology" and "covenant theology," arguing that dispensationalism, which sees the modern state of Israel as a fulfillment of biblical prophecy, is the dominant view among pro-Israel evangelicals.

2.  **Hummel, Daniel G. "The biggest fans of President Trump’s Israel policy: evangelical Christians." *The Washington Post*.** Hummel argues that evangelical support for Israel is deeply rooted in a specific eschatological belief system known as dispensational premillennialism. This view, popularized by the Scofield Reference Bible, interprets the establishment of the modern state of Israel as a key sign of the end times, making its support a prophetic necessity. This theological conviction translates directly into political action, such as advocating for moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.

"The ‘Judeo-Christian Tradition’ Is Over." *The Atlantic*.** Hamid contends that the concept of a "Judeo-Christian tradition" is a relatively recent political and social construct, not a timeless theological one. He explains how the term was popularized in the mid-20th century to forge a common American identity against perceived threats like communism and secularism, and how it has evolved to become a cornerstone of the modern conservative political alliance between certain Christian and Jewish groups.

He identifies Christian Zionists as a "critical component" of the pro-Israel lobby, arguing that their large numbers, high level of organization, and theological conviction that Israel's existence is a fulfillment of biblical prophecy make them a powerful influence on American foreign policy in the Middle East.

"More white evangelicals than American Jews say God gave Israel to the Jewish people."** This report provides key statistical data on American religious beliefs about Israel. Its central finding is that a higher percentage of white evangelical Protestants (82%) than American Jews (40%) believe that God gave the land of Israel to the Jewish people, highlighting the theological certainty that underpins evangelical support.
