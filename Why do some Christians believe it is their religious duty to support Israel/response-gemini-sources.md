# Why do some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel?

Some Christians, particularly a significant number of evangelicals in the United States, believe it is their religious duty to support the modern state of Israel based on specific theological interpretations of the Bible, historical beliefs, and a sense of shared heritage [1, 2]. These beliefs can be broken down into several key reasons:

1.  **The Abrahamic Covenant:** A foundational belief is the literal interpretation of God's covenant with Abraham in the book of Genesis. In Genesis 12:3, God promises Abraham, "I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse." Adherents of this view, often called Christian Zionists, believe this promise extends to Abraham's descendants, the Jewish people, and the land of Israel [2]. Therefore, they see supporting the nation of Israel as a divine mandate that brings God's blessing, while opposing it invites God's curse [1].

2.  **Fulfillment of End-Times Prophecy:** This view is central to a theological framework known as premillennial dispensationalism, which gained prominence in the 19th century through figures like John Nelson Darby and the popular Scofield Reference Bible [1]. According to this eschatology (theology of end times), the restoration of the Jewish people to their ancestral homeland is a critical prerequisite for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. The establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 and the Jewish people's return to the land are seen as a direct fulfillment of biblical prophecies, such as those in Ezekiel and Isaiah [1, 2]. Supporting Israel, including its political and military security and its control over Jerusalem, is viewed as helping to advance God's prophetic timeline leading to the Rapture, the Tribulation, and Christ's eventual return to reign on Earth [2].

3.  **Rejection of Replacement Theology:** Christian Zionism stands in direct opposition to "supersessionism," or Replacement Theology, a belief held by other Christian denominations that the Christian Church has replaced Israel as God's chosen people and inherited the covenants made with them. Christian Zionists argue that God's covenants with the Jewish people are eternal and unconditional [1]. They believe that the Jewish people remain a chosen people with a distinct role in God's plan, which includes their right to the land of Israel [4].

4.  **A Shared "Judeo-Christian" Heritage:** Beyond specific prophecies, some support for Israel is rooted in the concept of a shared "Judeo-Christian tradition." This idea frames Judaism as the historical and theological foundation of Christianity, creating a sense of spiritual debt and kinship with the Jewish people [3]. From this perspective, Christians have a moral obligation to support the Jewish people's self-determination in their historic homeland, recognizing that key events of Christian scripture took place there [3, 4].

These theological beliefs translate directly into political action, motivating many evangelicals to become some of the most steadfast advocates for pro-Israel policies in the United States, including financial aid and the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital [2].

He explains that this support is not a recent phenomenon but stems from 19th-century dispensationalist theology, popularized by figures like John Nelson Darby and the Scofield Reference Bible, which views the modern state of Israel as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy essential for the end times.

2.  **Hummel, Daniel G. "The biggest fans of President Trump’s Israel policy: evangelical Christians."** Hummel argues that evangelical backing for Israel is driven by a deeply held end-times theology. He asserts that for these believers, a Jewish state with control over Jerusalem is a non-negotiable step in the divine prophetic timeline that must occur before the second coming of Jesus, making political support for Israel a matter of religious duty.

3.  **Wolfe, Alan. "The 'Judeo-Christian Tradition' Is Over."** Wolfe contends that the term "Judeo-Christian tradition," once a unifying concept in American culture, has lost its original meaning. He argues that while it historically fostered a sense of shared values and a basis for Christian support for Jews and Israel, it is now often used by Christian nationalists in a way that is divorced from, and at times exclusionary of, contemporary Judaism.

4.  **Ariel, Yaakov. "Christian Zionism."** Writing for the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs, Ariel explains that Christian Zionism is rooted in the Protestant belief that God's covenant with the Jews is eternal and that the Bible is the literal word of God. This leads to the conviction that the Jewish people have a divine right to the land of Israel, a view that rejects Replacement Theology and has significantly influenced American attitudes and foreign policy toward the Middle East.
