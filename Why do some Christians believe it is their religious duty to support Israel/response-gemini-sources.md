# Why do some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel?

Some Christians, particularly within the American evangelical Protestant community, believe that supporting the modern state of Israel is a religious duty and a core component of their faith. This conviction stems from specific theological interpretations of the Bible, a sense of shared heritage, and political alignments that have developed over the past century [1, 2].

The primary reasons for this belief are:

**1. Theological Interpretations of Biblical Prophecy**

The most significant driver is a theological framework known as Christian Zionism, which is closely tied to a biblical interpretive system called dispensationalism [1, 4]. This view holds that the Jewish people remain God's chosen people and that the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, along with the gathering of Jews there, is a direct fulfillment of biblical prophecy. Key beliefs within this framework include:

*   **The Abrahamic Covenant:** Christian Zionists interpret God's promise to Abraham in Genesis 12:3—"I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse"—as a perpetual command for individuals and nations to support the Jewish people and, by extension, the state of Israel. They believe that America's well-being is tied to its support for Israel [2].
*   **End-Times Eschatology:** Dispensationalist theology posits that the return of Jewish people to the Holy Land is a necessary precondition for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Events such as the founding of Israel, the unification of Jerusalem, and the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple are seen as markers on a prophetic timeline leading to the Battle of Armageddon, the Tribulation, and Christ's eventual millennial reign from Jerusalem [1, 2]. Therefore, supporting Israel is seen as helping to advance God's prophetic plan.
*   **Rejection of Replacement Theology:** This viewpoint stands in contrast to "replacement theology" (or supersessionism), a more traditional view in Catholic and many mainline Protestant churches, which holds that the Christian Church has replaced Israel as the recipient of God's covenant promises. Christian Zionists adamantly reject this, arguing that God's covenants with Israel are eternal and have not been nullified [1].

**2. The Concept of a "Judeo-Christian" Heritage**

Many supporters of Israel also appeal to the idea of a shared "Judeo-Christian tradition." This concept frames Judaism and Christianity as parent and child religions that form the bedrock of Western civilization and American values [3]. This belief fosters a sense of cultural and political solidarity with Israel, which is often viewed as a fellow democracy in a hostile region, defending shared values. However, some historians and theologians argue that the term "Judeo-Christian tradition" is a relatively recent political invention, popularized in the 20th century to unite Americans against common enemies like Nazism and Communism, and later used to rally conservative support for policies favorable to Israel [3].

**3. Political and Geopolitical Alliances**

Theological beliefs have translated into a powerful political force. Christian Zionists are one of the most reliable and influential segments of the pro-Israel lobby in the United States [2, 4].

*   **Lobbying and Political Influence:** This group actively lobbies the government, pressures elected officials, and mobilizes voters to ensure U.S. foreign policy remains staunchly pro-Israel. Their influence was clearly demonstrated in their strong support for President Donald Trump's decisions to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, actions they viewed as prophetically significant [2].
*   **Grassroots Support:** Christian Zionists provide a massive and passionate grassroots base for pro-Israel sentiment, influencing public opinion and ensuring that political support for Israel remains a bipartisan priority, though it is strongest in the Republican party [4]. Their conviction is not based on strategic interests alone but on what they consider to be a divine mandate, making their support unwavering [1, 4].

In summary, the belief among some Christians that they have a religious duty to support Israel is primarily rooted in the eschatological framework of Christian Zionism, which sees the modern state of Israel as a fulfillment of biblical prophecy essential for the Second Coming of Christ. This theological conviction is bolstered by a sense of shared "Judeo-Christian" values and has been channeled into a potent political force that heavily influences U.S. foreign policy [1, 2, 4].

    Walker's article details the theological underpinnings of American evangelical support for Israel. He explains that this support is not based on foreign policy pragmatism but on a specific interpretation of biblical prophecy known as dispensationalism, which holds that God’s covenant with the Jews is eternal and that the modern state of Israel is a key sign of the end times. He contrasts this with traditional "replacement theology."

    Gorski outlines the historical and theological reasons why white evangelical Christians are such strong supporters of Israel and President Trump's pro-Israel policies. He connects their belief in biblical prophecy—specifically regarding the gathering of Jews in Israel as a prerequisite for the Second Coming of Christ—to their political activism and influence on U.S. foreign policy, such as the Jerusalem embassy move.

    Butler argues that the concept of a "Judeo-Christian tradition" is not an ancient, organic theological reality but a modern, 20th-century political construction. He traces its use as a tool to unify Americans against external threats and to advance a conservative political agenda, which includes mustering support for the state of Israel by framing it as a partner in a shared civilizational project.

    Mearsheimer (writing with Stephen Walt) argues that the pro-Israel lobby exerts a powerful and disproportionate influence on U.S. foreign policy, often shaping it in ways that are separate from U.S. strategic interests. He identifies Christian Zionists as a "crucial component" of this lobby, noting that their biblically-based support for Israel provides a massive and enthusiastic grassroots base that politicians cannot ignore.
