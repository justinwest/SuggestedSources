Some Christians, particularly a large segment of white evangelicals in the United States, believe it is their religious duty to support the state of Israel for a combination of theological, historical, and political reasons. This belief is primarily rooted in a specific biblical interpretation known as premillennial dispensationalism, which views the modern nation of Israel as a direct fulfillment of biblical prophecy [1, 2].

Key reasons for this support include:

**1. Theological Covenants and Prophecy**
The central theological pillar is a literal interpretation of the Bible, especially God's covenant with Abraham in the Book of Genesis [1]. In this view, God's promises to Abraham and his descendants—the Jewish people—are unconditional, eternal, and have not been replaced by the Christian Church. This includes the promise of a specific territory, the land of Israel [5]. According to a 2013 Pew Research Center poll, 82% of white evangelical Protestants believe that God gave the land of Israel to the Jewish people, a higher percentage than American Jews themselves (40%) [5].

This belief is a core tenet of dispensationalism, a theological framework popularized in the 19th century by John Nelson Darby and spread widely through the Scofield Reference Bible [6, 7]. Dispensationalism divides history into different eras ("dispensations") and maintains a sharp distinction between God's plans for Israel and His plans for the Church [1, 6]. Therefore, the re-establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 and its subsequent military victories, like the one in the 1967 Six-Day War, are seen as miraculous, modern-day fulfillments of ancient prophecy [2].

**2. End-Times Eschatology**
Dispensationalist theology is closely tied to a specific view of the end times (eschatology). Adherents believe that the "ingathering" of the Jewish people to their promised land is a crucial prerequisite for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ [2]. According to this timeline, events such as the Rapture of the Church, a seven-year Tribulation, and the final battle of Armageddon will precede Christ's return to Earth to establish a 1,000-year kingdom based in Jerusalem [1, 4]. For these believers, supporting the state of Israel is not just a political stance but a way to help bring about God's prophetic plan and hasten the return of Christ [2, 4].

**3. The "Blessing and Cursing" Principle**
Many Christian Zionists point to Genesis 12:3, where God tells Abram, "I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse." This verse is interpreted as a standing command for individuals and nations to support the Jewish people and, by extension, the modern state of Israel [1]. Following this belief, American prosperity and security are seen as being divinely linked to the United States' continued support for Israel [4].

**4. Political and Cultural Alliances**
Over time, these theological beliefs have fused with political movements. The rise of the Christian Right in the U.S. during the late 1970s made staunch support for Israel a key and non-negotiable part of its political platform [2, 4]. This has resulted in a powerful political lobby, sometimes referred to as the "Israel Lobby," in which Christian Zionists play a significant role by advocating for pro-Israel policies, influencing elections, and lobbying government officials [4].

Furthermore, the concept of a shared "Judeo-Christian tradition" has been used to frame this alliance. Though historically complex, this term became popular after World War II and during the Cold War to unite Americans against "godless communism" and, more recently, to create a sense of a shared civilizational front [3]. This framework helps solidify the idea of a natural alliance between Christians and Jews, with a shared biblical heritage centered on Israel [3].

    *   This article explains the theological underpinnings of evangelical support for Israel, focusing on the literal interpretation of God's covenant with Abraham, the "blessing and cursing" principle from Genesis 12:3, and the eschatological beliefs of dispensationalism. It contrasts this view with other Christian perspectives that do not see the modern state of Israel as a direct fulfillment of biblical prophecy.

    *   Sutton's article provides a historical account of how American evangelicals became staunch supporters of Israel. It highlights the 1967 Six-Day War as a pivotal moment, the popularization of end-times prophecy, and the rise of the Christian Right as a political force that embedded pro-Israel policy into its platform.

    *   This article argues that the concept of a "Judeo-Christian tradition" is a relatively modern, politically motivated construct rather than a long-standing theological reality. Walters traces its use as a tool to build political and cultural alliances, particularly during the Cold War and in contemporary conservative politics.

    *   Mearsheimer details the composition and influence of the pro-Israel lobby in the United States. He identifies Christian Zionists as a crucial and powerful component of this lobby, driven by both theological beliefs about the end times and the Genesis mandate to "bless" Israel, and who exert significant pressure on U.S. foreign policy.
