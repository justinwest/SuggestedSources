# Why do some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel?

Some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel due to a combination of theological, historical, and biblical interpretations rooted in their faith. This belief is particularly prominent among certain evangelical and fundamentalist Christian groups, though it is not universally held across all Christian denominations. Below are the key reasons behind this perspective, organized into theological, biblical, and practical dimensions.

**1. Biblical Foundations and Covenant Theology**  
A primary reason for Christian support of Israel stems from the belief in God's covenant with the Jewish people as described in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). In Genesis 12:3, God promises Abraham, the patriarch of the Jewish people, "I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you." Many Christians interpret this as a divine mandate to support the descendants of Abraham, understood to be the Jewish people and, by extension, the modern state of Israel. They believe that supporting Israel aligns them with God's will and brings divine favor, while opposing Israel risks divine judgment.

Additionally, some Christians adhere to a theology that views the Jewish people as God's "chosen people," a status that remains intact even after the coming of Jesus Christ. This perspective holds that God's promises to Israel, including the land of Canaan (modern-day Israel), are eternal and irrevocable, as reiterated in passages like Deuteronomy 30:1-5, where God promises to restore the Jewish people to their land.

**2. Eschatological Beliefs and the Role of Israel in End Times Prophecy**  
A significant factor driving Christian support for Israel is tied to eschatology, the study of end times or the "last days." Many evangelical Christians, particularly those who follow dispensationalist theology, believe that the reestablishment of Israel as a nation in 1948 fulfills biblical prophecies, such as those found in Ezekiel 36-37 (the vision of the "dry bones" coming to life) and Isaiah 11:11-12 (the regathering of Israel). They see the modern state of Israel as a prerequisite for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

In this view, events in Israel are part of a divine timeline leading to the apocalypse, including the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem and the Battle of Armageddon. For instance, some interpret passages in the Book of Revelation and Daniel as indicating that Israel must be a sovereign nation for these prophetic events to unfold. Supporting Israel, therefore, is seen as facilitating God's plan for the end times and hastening Christ's return.

**3. Historical and Moral Considerations**  
Beyond theology, some Christians feel a moral obligation to support Israel due to historical events, particularly the Holocaust, during which six million Jews were murdered by the Nazi regime. They view the establishment of Israel as a safe haven for the Jewish people after centuries of persecution, including pogroms, expulsions, and discrimination, often perpetrated in Christian-majority societies. Supporting Israel is seen as a way to atone for past Christian complicity in antisemitism and to stand against modern forms of hatred toward Jews.

Additionally, some Christians see Israel as a democratic ally in the Middle East, sharing values of freedom and religious tolerance in a region often perceived as hostile to Christian interests. This geopolitical alignment reinforces their religious convictions with a sense of practical solidarity.

**4. Christian Zionism**  
A specific movement within Christianity, known as Christian Zionism, explicitly advocates for the support of Israel based on religious grounds. Christian Zionists believe that the return of the Jewish people to the land of Israel is a fulfillment of God's promises and a necessary step in the divine plan. This movement gained prominence in the 19th and 20th centuries, influenced by figures like John Nelson Darby, who developed dispensationalist theology, and by political events such as the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which supported the establishment of a Jewish homeland.

Christian Zionists often actively lobby for political and financial support for Israel, viewing it as a religious duty. Organizations in the United States, such as Christians United for Israel (CUFI), exemplify this commitment, mobilizing millions of Christians to advocate for pro-Israel policies.

**5. Interpretive Differences and Context**  
It is important to note that not all Christians interpret the Bible or history in a way that mandates support for the modern state of Israel. Some argue that the New Testament, particularly through the teachings of Jesus and the Apostle Paul (e.g., Galatians 3:28, which emphasizes unity in Christ over ethnic distinctions), supersedes the Old Testament covenants, rendering the physical land of Israel less significant in the spiritual context of the Church as the "new Israel." Others critique Christian Zionism for conflating biblical prophecy with modern geopolitics or for ignoring the plight of Palestinians, including Palestinian Christians, in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Nevertheless, for those who do support Israel as a religious duty, their beliefs are often deeply personal and tied to their understanding of Scripture, history, and God's ongoing relationship with the Jewish people.

**Conclusion**  
In summary, some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel due to a combination of biblical promises, eschatological expectations, historical guilt and solidarity, and the influence of Christian Zionism. They view their support as both a spiritual obligation and a moral stance, rooted in their interpretation of God's covenant with the Jewish people and the role of Israel in divine prophecy. While this perspective is not shared by all Christians, it remains a powerful motivator for many, shaping their religious identity and political engagement on a global scale.
