### Introduction
Some Christians, particularly those within evangelical and fundamentalist traditions, believe that supporting the modern state of Israel is a religious duty rooted in their interpretation of the Bible. This perspective is often associated with Christian Zionism, a theological movement that views the establishment and protection of Israel as fulfilling divine prophecies and covenants. Not all Christians share this view; for instance, many mainline Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians emphasize social justice, Palestinian rights, or alternative interpretations of scripture that do not prioritize political support for Israel [1]. However, for those who do hold this belief, it stems from a combination of biblical, theological, and eschatological (end-times) reasons. This response explores these key motivations, drawing on historical and contemporary sources.

### Biblical Covenants and Promises
A primary reason is the belief in God's eternal covenants with the Jewish people, as described in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). Central to this is the Abrahamic Covenant in Genesis 12:1-3, where God promises Abraham (considered the patriarch of the Jewish people) land, descendants, and blessings, stating: "I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you." Many Christians interpret this as a directive that supporting Israel—seen as the modern embodiment of Abraham's descendants—invites divine favor, while opposing it risks divine disfavor [2].

This view extends to other scriptures, such as God's promise of the land of Canaan to the Israelites in Genesis 15:18-21 and Deuteronomy 30:1-5, which prophesy a return from exile. Supporters argue that the founding of Israel in 1948 and events like the 1967 Six-Day War fulfill these promises, making political and financial support a way to align with God's will [3]. Organizations like Christians United for Israel (CUFI) emphasize this, urging advocacy for Israel's security as a moral and spiritual imperative [2].

### Eschatological Beliefs and End-Times Prophecy
Another significant factor is premillennial dispensationalism, a theological framework popular among evangelicals since the 19th century. This interprets the Bible as dividing history into "dispensations" or eras, with Israel's restoration as a prerequisite for the end times. Key texts include prophecies in Ezekiel 36-37 (the "dry bones" vision of Israel's revival), Daniel, and Revelation, which are seen as predicting Israel's regathering, a period of tribulation, the Antichrist's rise, and Christ's Second Coming to rule from Jerusalem [4].

In this view, supporting Israel hastens these events and fulfills God's plan for humanity's redemption. For example, the return of Jews to Israel is believed to set the stage for the Battle of Armageddon and Christ's millennial kingdom. Influential figures like John Nelson Darby and Cyrus Scofield popularized this through the Scofield Reference Bible, influencing millions of American evangelicals [3]. Critics within Christianity argue this interpretation is selective and ignores New Testament emphases on spiritual rather than national Israel, but proponents see it as literal obedience to scripture [1].

### Theological Views on Israel's Role in Salvation History
Theologically, some Christians view the Jewish people as still "chosen" by God, with a distinct role separate from the Church. This "dual covenant" or replacement theology critique posits that God has not abandoned His promises to Israel, even after the advent of Christianity. Romans 11:1-2 and 11:29 are often cited: "God has not rejected his people... for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable." Supporting Israel is thus seen as respecting God's sovereignty and participating in His redemptive plan, which includes the eventual conversion of Jews to Christianity during the end times [4].

This belief has practical implications, such as lobbying for U.S. foreign policy favoring Israel, providing humanitarian aid, or opposing international criticism of Israeli policies. Events like the Holocaust are sometimes framed as satanic attempts to thwart prophecy, making Israel's survival a spiritual battle [2].

### Historical and Cultural Influences
Historically, Christian Zionism gained momentum in the 19th century through British and American figures like Lord Shaftesbury, who advocated for a Jewish homeland based on biblical restorationism. The 1948 establishment of Israel was hailed as a miracle, reinforcing these beliefs amid Cold War geopolitics and rising evangelical influence in the U.S. [3]. Today, this manifests in political activism, with groups like CUFI boasting millions of members who see support for Israel as combating antisemitism and aligning with biblical mandates [2].

### Diversity of Christian Perspectives
It's important to note that this view is not universal. Many Christians, including those in liberation theology traditions, prioritize peace, justice for Palestinians, and interpretations that see the Church as the "new Israel" (supersessionism). Organizations like the World Council of Churches advocate for balanced approaches [1]. Nonetheless, for adherents, supporting Israel is a profound expression of faith, blending scripture, prophecy, and geopolitics.
