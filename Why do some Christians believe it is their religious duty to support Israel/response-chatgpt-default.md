# Why do some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel?

Introduction  
Although Christians hold a wide range of views on modern-day Israel, a sizable current—often called “Christian Zionism” or “pro-Israel Evangelicalism”—maintains that supporting the Jewish state is a religious obligation. Their conviction rests on a cluster of biblical, theological, historical, ethical, and political considerations.

1. Biblical–Theological Foundations  
a. The Abrahamic covenant (Genesis 12, 15, 17)  
   • God promised Abraham and his descendants both a peoplehood and a specific land.  
   • Genesis 12:3 (“I will bless those who bless you”) is read as an ongoing mandate for Gentiles to bless the Jewish people; supporting modern Israel is viewed as a literal application.

b. Prophetic restoration texts  
   • Isaiah 11, Ezekiel 36–37, Amos 9, and other passages foresee the regathering of Jews to their ancestral land “in the latter days.”  
   • Many Evangelicals see the twentieth-century return of Jews and the founding of Israel (1948) as partial fulfillment, confirming that God’s promises remain active and validating continued Christian support.

c. Romans 9–11  
   • Paul teaches that God’s gifts and calling to Israel are “irrevocable” (11:29) and predicts a future salvation for “all Israel.”  
   • Christians who take this literally conclude that honoring God’s continuing plan for Israel is part of faithful discipleship.

d. Dispensational eschatology  
   • Popularized through the Scofield Reference Bible, Hal Lindsey’s “Late Great Planet Earth,” and contemporary prophecy teaching, dispensationalism distinguishes God’s purposes for the Church and national Israel.  
   • The timeline culminating in Christ’s second coming features the Jews’ return to the land, the rebuilding of the Temple, and events centered in Jerusalem. Active political support is therefore cast as cooperation with God’s end-time agenda.

2. Historical and Covenantal Identity  
a. Roots of the Christian faith  
   • Jesus, the apostles, and the Scriptures themselves are Jewish; many Christians feel indebted to the Jewish people for “giving the world the Bible and the Messiah.”  
   • Supporting Israel becomes an expression of gratitude and continuity with the “olive tree” in Romans 11.

b. Reaction to Christian antisemitism and the Holocaust  
   • After World War II, some churches repented of historic antisemitism and sought tangible ways to stand with the Jewish people.  
   • Backing Israel is seen as preventing future persecutions and demonstrating genuine repentance.

3. Ethical and Moral Arguments  
a. Solidarity with a perceived vulnerable minority  
   • Given centuries of Jewish dispersion and persecution, many Christians see the State of Israel as a safe haven whose security is a moral imperative.  

b. Justice and human rights narratives  
   • Some frame Israel’s existence as the outworking of the Jewish people’s right to self-determination, aligning with biblical calls to seek justice.

4. Political–Strategic Factors (often intertwined with theology)  
a. Shared democratic and “Judeo-Christian” values  
   • Israel is viewed as a like-minded democracy in a volatile region, so supporting it aligns with broader Christian cultural concerns.  

b. Influence of Christian organizations  
   • Groups such as Christians United for Israel (CUFI) or the International Christian Embassy Jerusalem mobilize believers, provide theological resources, and create pilgrimage experiences that strengthen emotional bonds.

5. Scriptural Imperatives for Prayer and Blessing  
   • Psalm 122:6—“Pray for the peace of Jerusalem”—is interpreted not merely as intercession but as endorsing policies that favor Israel’s security and prosperity.

6. Evangelistic Motives (among some Evangelicals)  
   • A minority sees Jewish return to the land as setting the stage for national turning to Christ; supporting Israel is thus preparatory to evangelistic hope.

Important Qualifications  
• Not all Christians accept these premises; many adhere to supersessionism or a “two-covenant” theology and do not equate biblical Israel with the modern state.  
• Mainline Protestants and historic peace churches often prioritize Palestinian rights or a broader peacemaking agenda.  
• Even within pro-Israel Evangelicalism there is diversity: some support a secure Israel alongside a viable Palestinian state, while others take a more maximalist stance.

Conclusion  
Christians who regard backing modern Israel as a religious duty do so chiefly because they interpret Scripture as teaching God’s enduring covenant with the Jewish people, anticipate prophetic fulfillment involving the land, feel moral responsibility after centuries of antisemitism, and perceive Israel as both a partner in democratic values and a focal point of God’s redemptive plan. These intertwined convictions produce vigorous advocacy—political, financial, and prayerful—that they view as an expression of faithfulness to God and the Bible.
