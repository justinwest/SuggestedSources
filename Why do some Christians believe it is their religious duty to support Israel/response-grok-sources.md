Some Christians, particularly evangelical Protestants in the United States, view supporting the modern state of Israel as a religious duty rooted in their interpretation of biblical prophecies, theological frameworks, and eschatological beliefs. This perspective is not universal among Christians—many mainline Protestants, Catholics, and Orthodox Christians do not share it or approach it differently—but it is prominent among certain groups influenced by dispensationalism and Christian Zionism. Below, I outline the key reasons for this belief, drawing on historical, theological, and sociological factors.

### Biblical and Theological Foundations
A primary reason stems from interpretations of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) that emphasize God's covenant with the Jewish people. Passages such as Genesis 12:1-3 and Genesis 15:18 are often cited, where God promises the land of Canaan (modern-day Israel and surrounding areas) to Abraham and his descendants as an everlasting inheritance [1][5]. For these Christians, supporting Israel fulfills a divine mandate, as they believe the Jewish people's return to the land in 1948 (the founding of modern Israel) is a fulfillment of prophecies in books like Ezekiel, Isaiah, and Amos, signaling God's ongoing plan [1][2][6].

This view is reinforced by the concept of "blessing Israel," derived from Genesis 12:3 ("I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse"). Some Christians interpret this as a call to actively support Israel politically and financially to receive divine favor, while opposing it risks divine disfavor [2][5]. Pew Research data highlights this: 82% of white evangelical Protestants in the U.S. believe God gave the land of Israel to the Jewish people, compared to 64% of American Jews [5]. This belief is not merely symbolic; it translates into advocacy for U.S. policies favoring Israel, such as recognizing Jerusalem as its capital or opposing Palestinian statehood [2].

### Eschatological Beliefs and the End Times
A significant driver is eschatology—the study of end times—particularly within dispensationalism, a theological system popularized in the 19th century by figures like John Nelson Darby and Cyrus Scofield [6]. Dispensationalists divide history into distinct "dispensations" or eras, viewing Israel as central to God's plan for the apocalypse. They believe the reestablishment of Israel is a prerequisite for events like the Rapture (the sudden removal of Christians from Earth), the Tribulation (a period of global chaos), and the Second Coming of Jesus Christ [1][6].

In this framework, Jews must control the land of Israel, including rebuilding the Temple in Jerusalem, for biblical prophecies to unfold (e.g., from Daniel and Revelation). Supporting Israel is thus seen as hastening Christ's return and aligning with God's will [1][2]. For instance, evangelical leaders like John Hagee of Christians United for Israel argue that failing to support Israel could delay these events or invite judgment [2]. This perspective gained traction in the U.S. during the Cold War, when Israel was seen as a bulwark against communism, blending religious duty with geopolitical strategy [1][4].

### Historical and Political Influences
The rise of Christian Zionism, which predates Jewish Zionism, also plays a role. Influenced by 19th-century Protestant movements in Britain and the U.S., some Christians advocated for a Jewish homeland as part of restoring biblical Israel [6]. This evolved into organized lobbying, with groups like the Israel Lobby (including Christian Zionists) pushing U.S. foreign policy toward unconditional support for Israel [4]. Critics like John Mearsheimer argue this lobby, comprising both Jewish and Christian elements, frames support as a moral and religious imperative, often overriding strategic considerations [4].

Additionally, the notion of a "Judeo-Christian" tradition fosters solidarity. Some Christians see shared values between Judaism and Christianity—such as monotheism and ethical teachings—as a basis for alliance, though this concept has been critiqued as a post-World War II invention to combat anti-Semitism and promote Western unity [3]. In the U.S., this translates into political action: Evangelicals, who make up about 25% of the population, were strong supporters of pro-Israel policies under President Trump, viewing them as divinely ordained [2].

### Variations and Criticisms
Not all Christians who support Israel do so for eschatological reasons; some emphasize humanitarian or anti-anti-Semitic motives, seeing Israel as a safe haven for Jews after the Holocaust [1]. However, dispensationalism remains the dominant theological underpinning among evangelicals [6]. Critics within Christianity argue this view supersedes the New Testament's emphasis on spiritual rather than territorial covenants, potentially leading to uncritical support for Israeli policies [1][3].

In summary, this belief is a confluence of scriptural interpretation, end-times theology, and historical advocacy, making support for Israel a perceived religious obligation for many evangelicals. While influential in U.S. politics, it is a minority view globally among Christians.
