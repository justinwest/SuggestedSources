# Why do some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel?

Many Christians, particularly evangelical Christians in the United States, believe it is their religious duty to support Israel due to a combination of theological, historical, and political reasons rooted in their interpretation of the Bible and their understanding of God's covenant with the Jewish people. This belief is especially prominent among evangelicals, who often view the modern state of Israel as a fulfillment of biblical prophecy and a key component of their faith's eschatological framework.

One primary reason for this belief is the theological concept of "Christian Zionism," which holds that the return of the Jewish people to the land of Israel is a prerequisite for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Evangelicals often cite biblical passages, such as those in the books of Genesis, Ezekiel, and Revelation, to argue that God promised the land of Israel to the Jewish people as an everlasting covenant. For instance, Genesis 12:3, where God tells Abraham, "I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse," is frequently interpreted as a divine mandate to support Israel to receive God's blessing [1][2]. According to a Pew Research Center survey, more white evangelicals (63%) than American Jews (31%) believe that God gave Israel to the Jewish people, highlighting the strength of this conviction within evangelical communities [5].

Additionally, many evangelicals see the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 as a miraculous fulfillment of prophecy, particularly in light of passages like Ezekiel 36-37, which speak of the restoration of Israel. This perspective frames support for Israel not just as a political stance but as a religious obligation to align with what they perceive as God's plan for the end times. As noted in *The Washington Post*, evangelical leaders often emphasize that supporting Israel is a way to hasten the apocalyptic events described in the Bible, including the return of Christ [2].

Historically, evangelical support for Israel has also been shaped by a sense of shared "Judeo-Christian" values, a concept that, while critiqued in *The Atlantic* as a relatively modern and sometimes oversimplified construct, has nonetheless fostered a sense of solidarity between Christians and Jews in the face of common adversaries [3]. This shared identity often translates into political advocacy for Israel, as evangelicals view the Jewish state as a democratic ally in a region perceived as hostile to both Christian and Western values.

Politically, evangelical support for Israel has been amplified by influential lobbying groups and leaders who frame this support as a moral and religious imperative. As discussed in *The Christian Century*, evangelical organizations often mobilize their communities to influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of Israel, seeing it as part of their mission to protect God's chosen people [1]. Similarly, John Mearsheimer's analysis in the *London Review of Books* points to the significant role of the "Israel Lobby," which includes evangelical Christian groups, in shaping American policy to prioritize Israel's interests, often driven by religious motivations alongside strategic and political ones [4].

However, it is important to note that not all Christians share this view. Some denominations and theologians argue against the conflation of biblical prophecy with modern geopolitics, emphasizing instead a call for peace and justice for both Israelis and Palestinians. Despite this, the evangelical perspective remains dominant in shaping Christian support for Israel, particularly in the United States, where evangelicals wield significant political influence [1][2].

In conclusion, the belief among some Christians, especially evangelicals, that supporting Israel is a religious duty stems from a deep-rooted theological interpretation of biblical texts, a historical sense of shared values, and a politically mobilized commitment to Israel's security and legitimacy. This conviction is not universal among Christians but is particularly strong within evangelical circles, where it is often seen as both a spiritual obligation and a means of fulfilling divine prophecy.
