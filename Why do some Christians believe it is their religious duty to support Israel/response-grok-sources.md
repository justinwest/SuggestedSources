# Why do some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel?

Many Christians, particularly evangelical Christians, believe it is their religious duty to support Israel due to a combination of theological, historical, and political reasons rooted in their interpretation of biblical texts and eschatological beliefs. This perspective is especially prominent among evangelicals in the United States, where support for Israel has become intertwined with religious identity and political activism. Below, I explore the primary reasons for this belief, drawing from the provided sources and additional context.

First, a significant theological foundation for Christian support of Israel stems from the belief in the Abrahamic covenant, as described in the Book of Genesis. In Genesis 12:3, God promises to bless those who bless Abraham and his descendants, which many Christians interpret as a divine mandate to support the Jewish people and, by extension, the modern state of Israel. Evangelicals often view Israel as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy, seeing the establishment of the state in 1948 as a sign of God’s ongoing plan for humanity [1]. This perspective is reinforced by the idea that the Jewish people are God’s “chosen people,” a belief that compels some Christians to advocate for Israel’s protection and prosperity as a way of aligning with divine will.

Second, eschatological beliefs, particularly those related to the Second Coming of Christ, play a central role in evangelical support for Israel. Many evangelicals adhere to a premillennial dispensationalist theology, which posits that the return of Jesus Christ is contingent upon certain events occurring in Israel, such as the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem and the ingathering of the Jewish people to their ancestral homeland. According to this view, supporting Israel is not just a political stance but a necessary step in hastening the fulfillment of end-times prophecies. As noted in historical analyses, this belief has driven evangelical activism, including lobbying for U.S. policies that favor Israel, such as the recognition of Jerusalem as its capital [2].

Third, the concept of a shared “Judeo-Christian” heritage contributes to the perception among some Christians that supporting Israel is a moral and religious obligation. This idea emphasizes common values and historical ties between Christianity and Judaism, framing Israel as a democratic ally in a region often seen as hostile to Western values. While some scholars argue that the “Judeo-Christian” narrative has been overemphasized or even misused in political contexts, it remains a powerful motivator for many Christians who see Israel as a bastion of shared religious and cultural principles [3].

Additionally, political and cultural factors amplify this religious duty for many Christians. In the United States, evangelical support for Israel has been reinforced by influential organizations such as Christians United for Israel (CUFI), which mobilizes millions of supporters to advocate for pro-Israel policies. This activism often aligns with conservative political agendas, creating a synergy between religious belief and political action. For instance, evangelical Christians were among the strongest supporters of President Donald Trump’s decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem in 2018, viewing it as both a political victory and a fulfillment of biblical prophecy [2].

However, it is important to note that not all Christians share this view. Some denominations and theologians argue against the conflation of biblical prophecy with modern geopolitics, emphasizing instead a call for peace and justice for all parties in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Critics within Christian circles, as highlighted in discussions of evangelical theology, caution against uncritical support for Israel, pointing to the ethical implications of policies that may marginalize Palestinians [1].

In conclusion, the belief among some Christians that supporting Israel is a religious duty is deeply rooted in theological interpretations of scripture, eschatological hopes, and a sense of shared heritage. While this perspective is particularly strong among evangelicals, it is not universal within Christianity, reflecting a diversity of thought on the intersection of faith and politics. The interplay of religious conviction and political activism continues to shape this complex issue, influencing both individual beliefs and broader policy debates.
