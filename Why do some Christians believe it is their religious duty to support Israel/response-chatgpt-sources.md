# Why do some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel?

Some Christians—especially white U.S. evangelicals and Pentecostals—talk about supporting the modern State of Israel not simply as a geopolitical preference but as a religious obligation.  Four overlapping convictions usually lie behind that sense of duty.

1. A continuing biblical covenant  
   • Genesis 12:3 (“I will bless those who bless you”) and related passages are read literally.  Because God promised the land to Abraham’s descendants “for ever,” many evangelicals believe the Jewish people still have a divine title to it and that Christians who “bless” Israel share in God’s favor [1].  
   • Surveys show that roughly 8 in 10 white evangelicals agree that “God’s covenant with the Jewish people still applies today,” a figure far higher than among other U.S. Christians [4].

2. End-times expectations (dispensationalism / Christian Zionism)  
   • Popular prophecy teachers from the late-19th-century dispensational tradition (e.g., John Nelson Darby, the Scofield Reference Bible) taught that Jews must return to their ancestral land, rebuild national sovereignty, and face a final conflict in Jerusalem before Jesus returns.  The creation of Israel in 1948 and Israel’s capture of Jerusalem in 1967 were therefore hailed as “fulfilled prophecy” and proof that the end-times clock is ticking [1].  
   • Because these events are seen as steps in God’s timetable, many evangelicals feel obliged to “stand with Israel” politically so that they are not found opposing God’s plan.  This helps explain why they were the strongest U.S. constituency cheering President Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017 [2].

3. Judeo-Christian solidarity and post-Holocaust ethics  
   • In the mid-20th century American religious leaders popularized the phrase “Judeo-Christian tradition” to stress common moral roots and to combat anti-Semitism after the Holocaust.  That rhetoric encouraged many Christians to treat Jewish flourishing—and, by extension, Israeli security—as a matter of religious loyalty and repentance for past Christian persecution of Jews [3].  

4. Religious activism and identity formation  
   • Pilgrimages to the Holy Land, prophecy conferences, Christian media, and organizations such as Christians United for Israel (CUFI) reinforce the above beliefs, turning them into a core piece of evangelical identity and political action [1].  Supporting Israel therefore becomes not just an opinion but a testimony of faith.

Important qualifications  
• These arguments are persuasive mostly within certain Protestant circles; many mainline Protestants, Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholics, and Palestinian Christians either do not share them or emphasize other biblical themes—justice, peacemaking, and the equal dignity of Israelis and Palestinians.  
• Even among evangelicals the younger generation is less certain that uncritical support for every Israeli policy is the best way to “bless” Israel [1].

In short, some Christians see support for Israel as a religious duty because they interpret the Bible’s covenant language and end-times prophecies literally, view Jews as spiritual kin within a “Judeo-Christian” moral community, and participate in dense networks that repeatedly link faithfulness to God with political backing for the modern Jewish state.
