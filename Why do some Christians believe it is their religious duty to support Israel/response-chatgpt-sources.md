# Why do some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel?

Many Christians—especially white U.S. evangelicals—see backing the modern State of Israel not simply as a policy preference but as an obligation rooted in the Bible, in particular readings of prophecy and in a post-1948 political theology often called “Christian Zionism.”  Several mutually reinforcing ideas lie behind this sense of duty.

1. A belief that God granted the land to the Jewish people for all time  
   • Genesis 12:1-3, 17:8 and related passages are read literally: God made an “everlasting covenant” giving Abraham’s descendants the land of Canaan.  To bless Israel is therefore to side with God; to oppose Israel risks divine judgment [1] [4].  
   • Many evangelicals quote Genesis 12:3 (“I will bless those who bless you…”) when explaining why individual Christians and the United States must stand with Israel [2].

2. Dispensational premillennial prophecy  
   • Popularized in the 19th century by John Nelson Darby and spread in the 20th century through the Scofield Reference Bible, radio preachers and best-selling fiction, dispensationalism teaches that history is divided into “dispensations” that culminate in Christ’s Second Coming.  One indispensable sign of the approaching end times is the physical return of Jews to their ancestral land and the re-establishment of Israeli sovereignty (fulfilled, in this view, in 1948 and 1967) [2] [4].  
   • Supporting Israel is thus seen as cooperating with God’s prophetic timetable.  John Hagee’s Christians United for Israel (CUFI) explicitly invokes this scenario when lobbying Congress or organizing “Night to Honor Israel” rallies [4].

3. The “Judeo-Christian” civilizational narrative  
   • After the Holocaust and during the Cold War, many American Protestants recast Judaism and Christianity as twin pillars of a single “Judeo-Christian” heritage, uniting them against secularism and communism.  This rhetorical move encouraged moral solidarity with Jewish people and with the new Israeli state [3].  
   • Although the Atlantic essay argues that the term is now fraying, it documents how the concept helped mid-century Christians frame support for Israel as a defense of shared biblical values [3].

4. A sense of moral debt after the Holocaust  
   • The annihilation of Europe’s Jews convinced many Christians that remaining silent about Jewish suffering was sinful.  Backing Israel became, for them, a way to repent for centuries of Christian anti-Judaism and for U.S. immigration policies that had turned away Jewish refugees during World War II [1].

5. Domestic politics and strategic alliance  
   • Evangelical leaders discovered in the 1970s that pro-Israel activism dovetailed with U.S. strategic interests in the Middle East and with conservative politics at home.  Politicians from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump have rewarded that activism with policy moves—such as recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital—that evangelicals celebrate as obedience to God’s plan [2].  
   • The Israel Lobby, John Mearsheimer notes, relies heavily on these “tens of millions of Christian Zionists” whose votes and donations amplify its influence in Washington [4].

6. Fear of divine or national judgment  
   • Prominent preachers warn that nations that abandon Israel will be cursed.  This conviction turns foreign policy into what Jerry Falwell once called a “biblical litmus test,” making support for Israel a patriotic as well as a religious duty for many believers [4].

Not all Christians accept these arguments.  Mainline Protestants, Eastern Orthodox and the Roman Catholic Church generally favor a more figurative reading of Israel’s biblical role and often criticize Israeli policies toward Palestinians.  Even within evangelicalism a younger cohort questions automatic support for Israel’s government and expresses greater sympathy for Palestinian Christians [1].

Nevertheless, among the roughly 60–70 million American evangelicals, the combination of covenant theology, apocalyptic expectation, a “Judeo-Christian” identity narrative and decades of political mobilization continues to foster the conviction that helping Israel is a Christian responsibility.
