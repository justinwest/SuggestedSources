# Why do some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel?

Many Christians—especially white U.S. evangelicals—see backing the modern State of Israel not merely as a political preference but as a religious obligation.  Their conviction rests on a cluster of biblical interpretations, end-times expectations, and cultural–political ideas that have been reinforced for more than a century.  The main elements are:

1. A literal reading of the biblical land promise  
   • Passages such as Genesis 12:1-3, 15:18 and Romans 11 are read to mean that God permanently “gave” the land of Israel to the Jewish people.  To “bless” Israel is therefore to obey God, while failing to do so risks divine displeasure [2].  
   • Surveys show that 82 % of white evangelicals, versus 40 % of American Jews, say the modern Jewish state exists because “God gave the land to the Jewish people,” indicating how deeply this reading shapes evangelical attitudes [5].

2. Dispensationalist and apocalyptic theology  
   • In the late 19th century the British preacher John Nelson Darby and, in the United States, the Scofield Reference Bible popularized “dispensationalism,” the idea that history unfolds in pre-set eras (dispensations).  
   • In this scheme, the return of Jews to their ancient homeland is a prerequisite for the Second Coming of Christ.  Events such as Israel’s 1948 founding and the 1967 Six-Day War were welcomed as signs that prophecy was being fulfilled, creating a sense of urgency to assist Israel’s success and territorial control [1], [2].  
   • Political scientist John Mearsheimer notes that millions of “Christian Zionists” consequently lobby Washington to avoid pressuring Israel, believing that God’s eschatological timetable is at stake [4].

3. The “Judeo-Christian” civilizational narrative  
   • During the mid-20th century U.S. Protestants began speaking of a shared “Judeo-Christian tradition,” presenting Jews and Christians as moral partners against secularism and Communism.  Embracing Israel became a way of dramatizing that alliance on the world stage [3].  
   • Although critics argue that the term now obscures important theological differences, it still frames Israel as a natural ally of Christian America, strengthening the sense of religious solidarity [3], [4].

4. A perceived moral debt and repentance for past anti-Judaism  
   • Some Christians feel that centuries of Christian anti-Semitism created an obligation to side with the Jewish state as an act of contrition and reconciliation, reinforcing the idea that support is not optional but imperative [1].

5. Institutionalization through churches, media and lobbying groups  
   • Best-selling books (e.g., Hal Lindsey’s The Late Great Planet Earth, the Left Behind novels), Christian television, and organizations such as Christians United for Israel have translated the above beliefs into sustained political activism [2], [4].  
   • These networks repeatedly tell believers that “standing with Israel” is part of their witness as Christians, ensuring that the theological duty is refreshed in each generation [1].

Taken together, these factors convince many Christians that helping Israel—politically, financially, and in prayer—is obedience to God, participation in prophecy, and loyalty to a shared biblical heritage.  While other Christians dispute this interpretation and support a more even-handed approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the combination of covenant theology, apocalyptic expectancy and cultural identification explains why large numbers continue to view support for Israel as a religious mandate.
