Estimating the number of immigrants in the United States who are residing illegally—often referred to as undocumented immigrants—is a complex task due to the inherent challenges in tracking individuals who, by definition, are not officially documented. However, various studies, government reports, and research organizations have provided estimates based on demographic data, surveys, and statistical modeling. Below is a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of this population as of the most recent data available.

### Estimated Number of Undocumented Immigrants
As of the most recent estimates, the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States is approximately **11 million**. This figure comes from widely cited research by organizations such as the Pew Research Center, the Center for Migration Studies (CMS), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Here are some key points regarding this estimate:

- **Pew Research Center (2021):** Pew estimates that there were about 10.5 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. as of 2017, with the number remaining relatively stable in recent years. Their methodology uses a "residual method," which subtracts the number of legal immigrants (based on government data) from the total foreign-born population (based on census and survey data).
- **Center for Migration Studies (2023):** CMS estimated the undocumented population at around 10.3 million in 2021, noting a slight decline from previous years due to factors like border enforcement, deportations, and some individuals gaining legal status.
- **Department of Homeland Security (2020):** The DHS estimated the unauthorized immigrant population at approximately 11.4 million in 2018. Their estimates tend to be slightly higher than those of independent research organizations due to differences in methodology.

These numbers are not exact because undocumented immigrants are not counted in official censuses or government records in a direct way. Estimates are derived from indirect methods, such as analyzing discrepancies in population data, labor force participation, and immigration enforcement statistics.

### Trends Over Time
The number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. has fluctuated over the past few decades:
- The population peaked at around 12.2 million in 2007, according to Pew Research, before declining during the Great Recession (2008–2009) due to reduced economic opportunities and increased border enforcement.
- Since 2010, the number has remained relatively stable, hovering between 10 and 11 million. This stability is attributed to a balance between new arrivals, deportations, deaths, and some individuals transitioning to legal status (e.g., through marriage or asylum).
- Notably, the share of undocumented immigrants from Mexico has declined over the past decade (from about 60% in 2007 to less than 50% in recent years), while the share from Central America, Asia, and Africa has increased.

### Demographic Breakdown
Research provides insight into the characteristics of the undocumented population:
- **Countries of Origin:** As of recent estimates, about 47% of undocumented immigrants are from Mexico, with significant numbers from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, India, and China.
- **Geographic Distribution:** Undocumented immigrants are concentrated in states with large immigrant communities, such as California (about 2 million), Texas (1.6 million), Florida (800,000), New York (600,000), and Illinois (400,000).
- **Duration of Stay:** Contrary to common assumptions, many undocumented immigrants have lived in the U.S. for over a decade. Pew Research indicates that two-thirds of undocumented adults have been in the country for more than 10 years.
- **Age and Family Structure:** About 4.4 million U.S.-born children (who are citizens) have at least one undocumented parent. Additionally, the undocumented population includes a mix of working-age adults, children, and a smaller number of elderly individuals.

### Challenges in Estimation
Several factors make it difficult to provide a precise count:
- **Lack of Direct Data:** Undocumented immigrants often avoid participating in surveys or censuses due to fear of deportation or legal consequences.
- **Methodological Differences:** Various organizations use different models and assumptions, leading to slight variations in estimates.
- **Policy and Enforcement Changes:** Shifts in immigration policy, border security, and deportation rates can affect the population size but are hard to measure in real time.
- **Underreporting:** Some undocumented individuals may be missed in data collection efforts, especially those in rural areas or with limited interaction with public systems.

### Sources of Data and Methodology
The primary methods for estimating the undocumented population include:
- **Residual Method:** Used by Pew and DHS, this subtracts the known legal immigrant population from the total foreign-born population (derived from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey).
- **Survey Data:** Organizations like the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) analyze survey responses to estimate characteristics and numbers.
- **Administrative Data:** DHS uses data from immigration enforcement actions, visa overstays, and border apprehensions to inform estimates.

### Policy Context and Implications
The size of the undocumented population is a significant factor in U.S. immigration policy debates. Key issues include:
- **Economic Impact:** Undocumented immigrants contribute to the economy through labor (often in agriculture, construction, and service industries) and taxes, but their lack of legal status limits access to benefits and protections.
- **Deportation and Enforcement:** Under various administrations, deportation numbers have fluctuated. For example, during the Obama administration, annual deportations peaked at over 400,000, while under the Trump administration, interior enforcement increased but total removals were lower due to fewer border crossings.
- **Pathways to Legalization:** Proposals like the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects about 600,000 "Dreamers" (undocumented individuals brought to the U.S. as children), highlight ongoing discussions about legal status for portions of this population.

### Conclusion
While exact numbers are impossible to determine, the most reliable estimates suggest that approximately **11 million undocumented immigrants** reside in the United States as of the most recent data (2017–2021). This figure has remained relatively stable over the past decade, though demographic shifts and policy changes continue to shape the population. For the most current and detailed information, I recommend consulting reports from organizations like the Pew Research Center, the Migration Policy Institute, or the Department of Homeland Security.
