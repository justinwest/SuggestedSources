### Overview of Unauthorized Immigrants in the United States

The question refers to the number of immigrants living in the United States without legal authorization, commonly known as unauthorized, undocumented, or illegal immigrants. This population includes individuals who entered the country without inspection (e.g., crossing the border unlawfully) or who overstayed valid visas, but excludes those with temporary protections like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in most estimates [1]. Estimating this number is challenging due to the clandestine nature of unauthorized migration, reliance on indirect methods (e.g., residual estimation from census data), and variations in data sources and methodologies. Official and nonpartisan estimates typically range from 10 to 12 million, while some advocacy groups provide higher figures [2][3].

### Current Estimates
According to the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan think tank, there were approximately 11.0 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. as of 2022. This represents a slight increase from 10.5 million in 2021, driven partly by post-pandemic migration trends, but it remains below the peak of 12.2 million in 2007 [1]. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), using a similar residual method (subtracting legal immigrants from total foreign-born populations in surveys), estimated 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants in January 2018, the most recent year for their detailed report [2]. The Migration Policy Institute (MPI), another independent research organization, aligns closely with these figures, estimating about 11.3 million in 2019, with breakdowns showing that roughly 77% are from Latin America, particularly Mexico (about 4.8 million) [3].

In contrast, some organizations with a focus on immigration restriction, such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), argue that official estimates undercount the population due to factors like underreporting in censuses and recent border encounters. FAIR estimates around 16.8 million unauthorized immigrants as of 2023, incorporating assumptions about uncounted entries and overstays [4]. However, these higher figures are often criticized by demographers for methodological flaws, such as overreliance on apprehension data without accounting for departures or legalizations [1][3].

### Historical Trends and Demographics
The unauthorized immigrant population grew rapidly from about 3.5 million in 1990 to a high of 12.2 million in 2007, then declined during the Great Recession due to economic factors and increased enforcement [1]. It stabilized around 11 million in the 2010s and has seen modest growth recently, influenced by global events like the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical instability [2]. Demographically:
- **Origin**: About 49% are from Mexico, though this share has declined as migration from Central America, Asia, and Africa has increased [1].
- **Geography**: California (1.9 million), Texas (1.7 million), Florida (1.0 million), and New York (0.7 million) host the largest populations [3].
- **Duration and Status**: Roughly 66% have lived in the U.S. for over a decade, and about 22% are under 18 years old. An estimated 4.4 million U.S.-born children live with at least one unauthorized parent [1].
- **Workforce Impact**: Unauthorized immigrants make up about 4.6% of the U.S. workforce, concentrated in industries like construction, agriculture, and hospitality [3].

These estimates are derived from sources like the American Community Survey (ACS) and Current Population Survey (CPS), adjusted for undercounts (typically 10-15%) [2]. Uncertainties arise from events like the 2022-2023 border surge, where over 2 million encounters occurred, but many resulted in expulsions or asylum claims rather than long-term unauthorized residence [1].

### Factors Influencing Estimates and Challenges
Methodologies vary: Nonpartisan sources like Pew and DHS use "residual" techniques, comparing total foreign-born populations to known legal residents [1][2]. Advocacy groups may extrapolate from border data or surveys, leading to discrepancies [4]. The actual number could fluctuate due to:
- **Entries and Exits**: Annual inflows (e.g., 700,000-800,000 visa overstays and unlawful entries) are offset by departures, deaths, and status adjustments [3].
- **Policy Changes**: Programs like DACA protect about 600,000 individuals, who are often excluded from unauthorized counts [1].
- **Data Gaps**: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted surveys, and the 2020 Census may have undercounted immigrants [3].

For the most accurate, up-to-date figures, refer to ongoing research from Pew or DHS, as estimates are periodically revised. If the question seeks data on specific subgroups (e.g., by state or origin), more granular reports are available [3].
