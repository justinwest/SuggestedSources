# How many immigrants are in the United States illegally?

Based on a 2018 study from MIT Sloan and Yale University, the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States was estimated to be 22.1 million in 2016 [1]. This figure is roughly double the widely used estimate of 11.3 million for the same period [1].

The researchers developed their estimate by creating a model that simulated the monthly inflows and outflows of the undocumented population from 1996 to 2016 [1]. This model analyzed operational data, including:
*   Border apprehensions
*   Deportations
*   Visa overstays [1]

While the study's estimate for the total population is significantly higher than other figures, it also found that the growth rate of the undocumented population has slowed [1].

1.  This article reports on a 2018 study by researchers from MIT Sloan and Yale University. The study's authors argue that the undocumented immigrant population in the U.S. was approximately 22.1 million in 2016, a figure nearly double the more common estimate of 11.3 million. The authors base their conclusion on a model that analyzes operational data such as border apprehensions, deportations, and visa overstays.
