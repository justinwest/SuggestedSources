There is no single, universally agreed-upon figure for the number of immigrants living illegally in the United States. Estimates vary significantly depending on the methodology, data sources, and the time period being analyzed. The most credible analyses place the number anywhere from just over 10 million to over 20 million people.

### Mainstream and Recent Estimates (10.7 to 14 Million)
Historically, the most widely cited estimates have placed the unauthorized immigrant population at around 11 million. The Department of Homeland Security estimated the population at 11 million in 2018, while the Pew Research Center placed it at 10.5 million in 2021 [2, 4]. These figures are typically calculated using the "residual method," which involves subtracting the number of legal foreign-born residents from the total foreign-born population captured in census data [4].

However, due to an increase in border crossings since 2021, most analysts agree that this population has grown. Reflecting this trend, some recent estimates are significantly higher:
*   **Center for Immigration Studies (CIS)**: This organization estimated that the unauthorized immigrant population reached 13.7 million at the beginning of 2024 [2].
*   **Projections for 2023**: Some analyses project that the population reached a record high of approximately 14 million in 2023, though a definitive report from major research centers for this period is not yet available [5].

### High-End Academic Estimate (22 Million)
A 2018 study from researchers at the MIT Sloan School of Management and the Yale School of Management produced a dramatically higher estimate. Using a mathematical model based on operational data—such as deportations, visa overstays, and mortality rates—rather than census surveys, the researchers concluded that the undocumented immigrant population was 22.1 million in 2016 [1]. This figure is roughly double the conventional estimates from the same period, and while it represents a different academic perspective, it is not as widely cited as the lower figures from organizations like the Pew Research Center [1, 4].

### Understanding Immigration Statistics: Population vs. "Encounters"
It is important to distinguish between the total population of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. (a "stock") and the number of border "encounters" (a "flow"). Government data often highlights the number of encounters, which are events, not unique individuals [2].

For example, the House Committee on Homeland Security reported nearly 3 million "inadmissible encounters" at the U.S. border in Fiscal Year 2024 and a total of 10.8 million encounters since the start of Fiscal Year 2021 [3]. However, these numbers include individuals who may have been stopped multiple times, as well as those who were immediately expelled and never entered the U.S. interior [2]. Therefore, encounter figures reflect the scale of attempted crossings but do not directly translate to the net increase in the number of unauthorized immigrants residing in the country [2, 3].
