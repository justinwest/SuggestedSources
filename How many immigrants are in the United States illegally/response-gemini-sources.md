Determining the exact number of immigrants living in the U.S. without authorization is challenging, as there is no official count. Instead, government agencies, think tanks, and academic researchers produce estimates that vary based on their methodologies. These estimates range from approximately 10.5 million to over 22 million.

### Competing Estimates of the Total Undocumented Population

The most commonly cited estimates place the total unauthorized immigrant population between 10 and 11 million.
*   **Pew Research Center:** One of the most frequently referenced sources, the Pew Research Center, estimated there were 10.5 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in 2021. This number has remained relatively stable since 2009, after peaking at 12.2 million in 2007 [2].
*   **Department of Homeland Security (DHS):** The DHS's most recent official estimate, as of January 2022, placed the number at 11.0 million [2].

However, a 2018 study by researchers from MIT Sloan and Yale University presented a significantly higher figure. Using mathematical modeling on demographic and immigration data from 1990 to 2016, they concluded that the standard estimates were too low.
*   **MIT/Yale Study:** Their research model calculated a mean estimate of **22.1 million** undocumented immigrants residing in the U.S. in 2016. The authors argue that previous models may have underestimated inflows and overestimated outflows, leading to a lower count [1].

### Distinguishing Total Population from Border Encounters

It is crucial to distinguish the total undocumented population (a "stock" figure) from the number of border encounters (a "flow" figure). Recent news has focused on a surge in encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border, but these numbers do not represent the net increase in the long-term undocumented population [2, 4].

*   **Border Encounters:** This metric counts the number of times authorities apprehend or expel individuals attempting to cross the border, not the number of unique people. One person can be counted multiple times if they make multiple attempts [2]. According to a factsheet from the House Committee on Homeland Security, there were nearly 3 million "inadmissible encounters" in Fiscal Year 2024 and a total of **10.8 million** encounters since the start of Fiscal Year 2021 [3].
*   **"Gotaways":** This term refers to individuals who U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) detects but is unable to apprehend. The House Committee on Homeland Security reports that there have been over 2 million known "gotaways" since Fiscal Year 2021 [3]. While these individuals contribute to the undocumented population, the number is an estimate, and it is separate from the total number of encounters.

In summary, while official and commonly cited estimates suggest a stable undocumented population of around 10.5 to 11 million people, some academic models propose the number could be as high as 22 million. Recent, high-profile figures on border crossings reflect the *flow* of migrants and do not directly translate to the total number of undocumented immigrants living in the country long-term [2, 4].

This article from MIT Sloan summarizes a 2018 study co-authored by one of its professors. The authors argue, based on a new mathematical model, that the actual undocumented immigrant population is much larger than commonly believed, estimating it at 22.1 million in 2016.

FactCheck.org provides a detailed explanation of different immigration statistics. The authors clarify the distinction between the total unauthorized immigrant population ("stock") and border encounters ("flow"). They cite the most common estimates for the total population from sources like the Pew Research Center (10.5 million) and the Department of Homeland Security (11 million).

This factsheet from the Republican-led U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security focuses on the high volume of recent border activity. The authors present data on border encounters and "gotaways" to argue that current administration policies have created a security crisis. It primarily focuses on flow data rather than the total stock population.
