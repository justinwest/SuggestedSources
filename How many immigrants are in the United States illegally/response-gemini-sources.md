Based on the source provided, a 2018 study by researchers from MIT and Yale estimated the undocumented immigrant population in the United States to be 22.1 million as of 2016 [1].

This figure is significantly higher—roughly double—than the more commonly cited estimate of 11.3 million [1]. The researchers, including MIT Sloan professor Mohammad Fazel-Zarandi, developed a new mathematical model to arrive at their conclusion. Key findings from the study include:

*   **Different Methodology**: Traditional estimates typically use a "residual method," where the number of legal foreign-born residents is subtracted from the total foreign-born population recorded in census surveys. The study's authors argue this method is prone to undercounting [1].
*   **New Model**: The new study used a model that analyzed "operational data" on population inflows and outflows from 1990 to 2016. This data included border apprehensions, visa overstays, deportations, and mortality rates [1].
*   **Historical Trends**: The model suggests that the undocumented population grew rapidly in the 1990s and early 2000s. The researchers concluded that inflows during that period were much higher, and outflows were lower, than previously believed, leading to the larger total estimate of 22.1 million [1].

1.  **MIT Sloan School of Management, "Study: Undocumented immigrant population is roughly double the current estimate"**: This article details a 2018 study from researchers at MIT and Yale who argue that the U.S. undocumented immigrant population was approximately 22.1 million in 2016. This view is based on a new mathematical model that uses operational data (like deportations and visa overstays) and suggests that previous census-based estimates of around 11.3 million are significant undercounts.
