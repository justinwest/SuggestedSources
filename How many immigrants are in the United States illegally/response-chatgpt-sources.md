# How many immigrants are in the United States illegally?

Best current estimate  
A 2018 MIT–Yale study summarized by MIT Sloan estimates that about 22 million people are living in the United States without legal authorization.  The researchers’ statistical model places the likely total in a range of roughly 16.7 million to 29.5 million, but identifies 22.1 million as the most probable figure—nearly double the long-cited official estimate of about 11 million undocumented immigrants [1].

Sources  
[1] MIT Sloan. The authors describe new research by MIT and Yale scholars showing that the undocumented population is “roughly double” the commonly accepted figure; their model produces a central estimate of 22.1 million and a credible range of 16.7 – 29.5 million.  https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-undocumented-immigrant-population-roughly-double-current-estimate
