Short answer
- Best current estimate: about 14 million unauthorized (undocumented) immigrants lived in the U.S. in 2023, according to the latest comprehensive estimate from Pew Research Center [1].
- Other mainstream estimates in recent years had put the figure closer to 10–11 million, reflecting earlier years and different methods; that lower range still appears in 2024 reporting that explains the measurement challenges [2][3].
- A minority view from an MIT-linked study argues the true number could be far higher (around 22 million as of 2016), but this estimate is disputed and not used by most demographers [5].

Why the numbers differ
- Stock vs. flow: The “unauthorized population” is a stock (how many people are residing in the country without authorization at a point in time). Border “encounters” are flows (events), not residents, and include repeat crossers and people who are turned back or removed [2]. For example, a congressional fact sheet cites roughly 10.8 million encounters since FY2021 and nearly 3 million in FY2024 alone, but those figures cannot be added to estimate how many people currently live in the U.S. without authorization [4].
- Method and timing: Demographers typically estimate the unauthorized population by subtracting lawfully present foreign-born people from the total foreign-born population measured in large surveys, then adjusting for undercount. Different surveys, adjustments, and reference years can yield different results. Earlier mainstream estimates placed the population around 10–11 million, while newer work by Pew puts it at about 14 million in 2023, indicating growth in recent years [1][2][3].
- Outlier estimates: One academic approach using alternative modeling suggested a much higher number (16.7–29.5 million, centered near 22 million) for 2016, but this approach has been widely debated and has not been adopted by most researchers or official statistical agencies [5].

Bottom line
- The most credible, up-to-date point estimate is about 14 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. in 2023 [1].
- Reasonable recent estimates across mainstream sources span roughly 10–14 million, depending on the year measured and method used [1][2][3].
- Claims that simply add up border encounters to infer the resident unauthorized population are incorrect; encounters are not the same as people residing in the country [2][4].
