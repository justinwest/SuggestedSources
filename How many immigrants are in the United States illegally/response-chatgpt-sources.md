Researchers do not agree on a single figure, but the newest peer-reviewed analysis indicates that the unauthorized population is considerably larger than the long-standing conventional estimate.

• Conventional estimate  
  – The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Pew Research Center have for years placed the unauthorized population at roughly 11 million people (about 10.7-11.7 million in recent releases) [1].

• Newer estimate from MIT Sloan/Yale study  
  – Using a demographic‐modeling approach that tracks visa overstays, border crossings, births, deaths, and emigration, MIT Sloan and Yale researchers calculated that 22.1 million immigrants were living in the country without legal status in 2016.  
  – Their statistical model produces a 95 % probability range of 16 million to 29 million, implying that the true number is likely “roughly double” the conventional estimate [1].

Answer  
Depending on which estimate one relies on, the number of immigrants residing in the United States illegally is likely somewhere between about 11 million (traditional government and think-tank counts) and about 22 million (the latest academic estimate), with the newer study’s best point estimate being 22.1 million people.
