Estimates of how many immigrants are in the United States illegally vary, and there is no exact count due to the inherent difficulty of measuring this population. A prominent **2018 study by MIT and Yale researchers** suggested that the number of undocumented immigrants could be about **22 million**, roughly double the traditionally cited estimate ([mitsloan.mit.edu](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-undocumented-immigrant-population-roughly-double-current-estimate#:~:text=The%20research%20found%20that%20the,Kaplan%20and%20Jonathan%20Feinstein%2C%20both)). This higher estimate was derived using alternative methods (relying on operational data like visa overstays and deportations) and was meant to account for possible undercounting in surveys. Most demographers and government agencies, however, **put the figure much lower** – on the order of **10 to 12 million**. In fact, the **U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)** estimated about **11 million** unauthorized immigrants living in the country as of January 2022 ([feeds.bbci.co.uk](https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/articles/c0jp4xqx2z3o#:~:text=The%20US%20Department%20of%20Homeland,US%20as%20of%20January%202022)). This widely accepted estimate has remained around 11 million for many years, indicating that the unauthorized population grew rapidly in the 1990s and early 2000s but then leveled off and even declined slightly in the late 2000s and 2010s. (DHS data show that about one-fifth of the 11 million arrived in 2010 or later, while the **majority have lived in the U.S. for decades** ([feeds.bbci.co.uk](https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/articles/c0jp4xqx2z3o#:~:text=The%20US%20Department%20of%20Homeland,US%20as%20of%20January%202022)).)

**Recent surges in border crossings** have led to additional estimates and political claims that deserve context. Under the Biden administration, record numbers of migrants have been encountered at the U.S.–Mexico border. **U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)** has recorded **over 10 million “encounters”** with migrants at the borders since early 2021 ([ebs.publicnow.com](https://ebs.publicnow.com/view/C42F6837FF6C8AB74B74345B551E30A046AAEC52#:~:text=Yet%20again%20under%20President%20Biden%2C,9%20million%20nationwide%20encounters)). (Encounters include people stopped crossing illegally plus those deemed inadmissible at ports of entry.) Some politicians have cited this 8–10 million figure to claim an unprecedented wave of *millions* of new illegal immigrants in the country. **Fact-checkers note this is misleading** because **“encounters” are not the same as individuals settling in the U.S.** – many migrants are counted multiple times or quickly expelled. For example, about **2.8 million of those recent encounters resulted in immediate removal or expulsion** (often under pandemic-era rules), and others were repeat attempts by the same people ([www.factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/#:~:text=The%20figures%20used%20by%20Haley%2C,encountered%20are%20not%20simply%20released)). In total, well over half of all migrants encountered at the southwest border in the last few years *did not stay* in the U.S. but were turned back ([www.factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/#:~:text=Total%20DHS%20repatriations%20through%20October,and%20removal%20operations%2C%E2%80%9D%20DHS%20explains)). (Even the raw encounter counts exclude “gotaways” – those who evaded capture – estimated at around 1.6–1.7 million in the 2021–2023 period ([www.factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/#:~:text=authorities,from%20February%202021%20through%20October)) ([www.factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/01/factchecking-the-haley-desantis-gop-debate/#:~:text=Since%20Biden%20took%20office%20in,border%20illegally%20without%20being%20apprehended)).) The bottom line is that while the **unauthorized population has likely grown somewhat in recent years**, it has **not increased by the full 8–10 million** often cited from border statistics ([www.factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/#:~:text=The%20figures%20used%20by%20Haley%2C,encountered%20are%20not%20simply%20released)).

In summary, **most experts estimate** that roughly **11 million** immigrants are living in the United States without legal status, give or take a million or two. This remains the ballpark figure used in official reports and research. However, there is **some debate**: one academic study argues the true number could be significantly higher (in the 16–22 million range) ([mitsloan.mit.edu](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-undocumented-immigrant-population-roughly-double-current-estimate#:~:text=The%20research%20found%20that%20the,Kaplan%20and%20Jonathan%20Feinstein%2C%20both)), while on the other hand, political talking points sometimes inflate the figure by conflating short-term border apprehensions with long-term residents ([www.factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/#:~:text=The%20figures%20used%20by%20Haley%2C,encountered%20are%20not%20simply%20released)). As of now, a reasonable estimate is on the order of **ten to twelve million undocumented immigrants** in the U.S., acknowledging uncertainty and the possibility of undercounting. All sources agree that **millions of these individuals have been residing in the country for many years**, and the population’s growth has been relatively modest compared to the large inflows suggested by recent border encounter numbers ([feeds.bbci.co.uk](https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/articles/c0jp4xqx2z3o#:~:text=The%20US%20Department%20of%20Homeland,US%20as%20of%20January%202022)) ([www.factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/#:~:text=The%20figures%20used%20by%20Haley%2C,encountered%20are%20not%20simply%20released)).

1. **MIT Sloan (Study by Fazel-Zarandi et al.)** – Reports a **research study from MIT and Yale** (published 2018) which estimates the undocumented immigrant population at about *22.1 million* – roughly double the conventional estimate of ~11 million. The authors argue that traditional survey-based methods undercount this “hidden” population ([mitsloan.mit.edu](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-undocumented-immigrant-population-roughly-double-current-estimate#:~:text=The%20research%20found%20that%20the,Kaplan%20and%20Jonathan%20Feinstein%2C%20both)). They present a higher range (with a lower-bound around 16.7 million) to suggest the true number of undocumented immigrants could be significantly larger than commonly thought. *([MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-undocumented-immigrant-population-roughly-double-current-estimate) – Mohammad Fazel-Zarandi and colleagues’ view)*

2. **FactCheck.org (Feb 2024 Analysis)** – Provides a **breakdown of immigration figures** and refutes misleading claims about the number of immigrants “coming in illegally.” It explains that some politicians’ claims of “8–10 million” new illegal immigrants under the Biden administration are **exaggerated** because they conflate **border encounters** (which topped millions) with the actual number who stayed in the country. The article notes that around 2.8 million of those encounters were quickly **removed or expelled**, and many others were repeat crossers – so the net additions to the undocumented population are far smaller ([www.factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/#:~:text=The%20figures%20used%20by%20Haley%2C,encountered%20are%20not%20simply%20released)). *([FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/) – Emphasizes context and clarifies that encounters ≠ residents)*

3. **U.S. House Homeland Security Committee (Oct 2024 Factsheet)** – Presents a **partisan “Startling Stats” factsheet** highlighting the scale of recent illegal immigration under the Biden administration. It cites CBP data showing **a total of 10.8 million migrant encounters since FY 2021** (including 8.7 million at the southwest border) and around 2 million “gotaways” in the same period ([ebs.publicnow.com](https://ebs.publicnow.com/view/C42F6837FF6C8AB74B74345B551E30A046AAEC52#:~:text=Yet%20again%20under%20President%20Biden%2C,9%20million%20nationwide%20encounters)). The Committee (chaired by Rep. Mark Green) frames these figures as evidence of a “historic border crisis” and criticizes the administration’s policies, suggesting that hundreds of thousands of those encountered have been released into the U.S. interior. *([Homeland House Committee Press Release](https://homeland.house.gov/2024/10/24/startling-stats-factsheet-fiscal-year-2024-ends-with-nearly-3-million-inadmissible-encounters-10-8-million-total-encounters-since-fy2021/) – Highlights the **record-high encounter numbers** and paints them as a security crisis)*

4. **BBC News / BBC Verify (Sept 2024)** – Provides a **factual explainer** on U.S. illegal immigration numbers in the context of political claims. It notes that **DHS estimates about *11 million* people are living in the U.S. illegally as of 2022** ([feeds.bbci.co.uk](https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/articles/c0jp4xqx2z3o#:~:text=The%20US%20Department%20of%20Homeland,US%20as%20of%20January%202022)), a figure reflecting years of data and analysis. The BBC also explains that while more than 10 million migrant encounters have been recorded since 2021, **“the number of encounters is not a count of individuals who stay in the US”**, since many are turned back or make multiple attempts ([feeds.bbci.co.uk](https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/articles/c0jp4xqx2z3o#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20encounters%20is,trying%20to%20enter%20multiple%20times)). This piece thus balances the long-standing estimated **stock** of undocumented immigrants (~11 million) with the recent **flow** of migrants at the border, stressing that the latter should not be directly equated with permanent new illegal residents. *([BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jp4xqx2z3o) – Confirms the ~11 million figure and cautions against misinterpreting border crossing statistics)*
