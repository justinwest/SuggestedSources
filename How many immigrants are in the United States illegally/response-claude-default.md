The number of unauthorized immigrants living in the United States is estimated to be between 10.5 and 12 million people as of recent estimates, though precise figures are inherently difficult to determine due to the population's undocumented nature.

## Current Estimates

According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), there were approximately 11 million unauthorized immigrants residing in the United States as of January 2022 [1]. This represents a slight increase from their 2020 estimate of 10.5 million [1]. The Pew Research Center, using different methodology, estimated the unauthorized immigrant population at 10.5 million in 2021, down from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007 [2].

The Migration Policy Institute (MPI) provides similar estimates, calculating approximately 11 million unauthorized immigrants as of 2021 [3]. These organizations use different methodological approaches but arrive at broadly similar figures, suggesting the estimates are relatively reliable within a margin of error.

## Historical Trends

The unauthorized immigrant population grew rapidly from the 1990s through 2007, when it reached its historical peak [2]. Since then, the numbers have remained relatively stable or slightly declined. The Great Recession of 2008-2009, increased border enforcement, and changing migration patterns from Mexico have all contributed to this stabilization [2][3].

## Demographics and Distribution

The largest share of unauthorized immigrants comes from Mexico, though this proportion has decreased over time. As of 2021, Mexicans made up about 37% of the unauthorized population, down from 57% in 2007 [2]. Other significant origin countries include El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, China, and India [3].

Geographically, unauthorized immigrants are concentrated in several states. California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois account for the majority of this population [1][3]. About two-thirds of unauthorized immigrants have lived in the United States for more than 10 years [2].

## Methodological Challenges

Estimating the unauthorized immigrant population involves significant challenges. Researchers typically use a "residual method," which compares the total foreign-born population (from Census data) with the legally present foreign-born population (from administrative records) [1][2]. The difference provides an estimate of the unauthorized population, though this method has inherent limitations and margins of error.

## Labor Force Participation

Unauthorized immigrants comprise approximately 4.6% of the U.S. civilian workforce, despite representing about 3.3% of the total U.S. population [2]. They are particularly concentrated in industries such as construction, agriculture, hospitality, and domestic services [3].
