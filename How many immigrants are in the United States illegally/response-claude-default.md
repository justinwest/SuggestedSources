# Unauthorized Immigration in the United States: Current Estimates

## Best Available Estimates

Based on the most recent reliable data, **approximately 10.5 to 12 million** people are estimated to be living in the United States without legal authorization as of 2022-2023.

## Key Sources and Methodologies

### Primary Research Organizations:
- **Pew Research Center**: ~10.5 million (2022 estimate)
- **Migration Policy Institute**: ~11-12 million
- **Department of Homeland Security**: ~11.4 million (2022)
- **Center for Migration Studies**: ~10.2 million (2022)

### Why Estimates Vary:
- **Methodological differences** in data collection and analysis
- **Different definitions** of "unauthorized" status
- **Challenges in counting** a population that may avoid official contact
- **Time lag** in data processing and publication

## Important Context

### Demographic Trends:
- The unauthorized population has remained relatively **stable** since 2010
- It peaked around 12.2 million in 2007
- Represents approximately **3% of the total U.S. population**

### Geographic Distribution:
- Concentrated in states like California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Illinois
- Approximately 60-65% have been in the U.S. for **more than 10 years**

## Methodology Limitations

Researchers typically use:
- Census data analysis
- Statistical modeling
- Administrative records comparison
- Survey data extrapolation

These methods involve inherent uncertainties, which is why figures are presented as estimates rather than exact counts.

*Note: These figures represent academic and government research estimates and should be understood within the context of ongoing policy and research discussions.*
