The number of immigrants living in the United States without legal authorization is estimated to be between 10.5 and 12 million people as of recent years, though precise counts are inherently difficult due to the undocumented nature of this population [1][2].

## Current Estimates

According to the Pew Research Center, approximately 10.5 million unauthorized immigrants lived in the U.S. as of 2017, representing about 3.2% of the total U.S. population [1]. The Department of Homeland Security estimated a similar figure of 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants as of January 2018 [2]. More recent estimates from various research organizations suggest the number has remained relatively stable, ranging between 10.5 and 12 million [3].

## Methodology and Challenges

These estimates are derived through statistical modeling rather than direct counting, as unauthorized immigrants are not systematically tracked. Researchers typically use the "residual method," which involves:

- Starting with total foreign-born population counts from the U.S. Census
- Subtracting the number of legal immigrants based on government records
- Adjusting for undercounting in census data [1][4]

The inherent limitations of this approach mean that estimates can vary significantly between organizations and time periods.

## Historical Trends

The unauthorized immigrant population grew rapidly from the 1990s through the mid-2000s, peaking at approximately 12.2 million in 2007. Since then, the numbers have either declined or remained relatively stable, influenced by factors including:

- Economic conditions in both the U.S. and origin countries
- Immigration enforcement policies
- Border security measures
- Changes in migration patterns [1][5]

## Geographic and Demographic Distribution

The unauthorized immigrant population is concentrated in certain states, with California, Texas, Florida, New York, and New Jersey hosting the largest numbers. Approximately 75% of unauthorized immigrants have lived in the U.S. for more than 10 years as of recent estimates [1][6].

## Data Limitations

It's important to note that all figures are estimates with margins of error. The undocumented nature of this population, combined with concerns about participating in government surveys, makes precise enumeration impossible. Different methodological approaches can yield varying results, and estimates should be understood as approximations rather than exact counts [4].
