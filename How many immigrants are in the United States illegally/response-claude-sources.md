# How many immigrants are in the United States illegally?

Based on the available source, estimates of the undocumented immigrant population in the United States vary significantly depending on the methodology used.

## Current Estimates and Methodological Differences

Traditional government estimates have typically placed the undocumented immigrant population at around 11-12 million people. However, recent research suggests this figure may be substantially underestimated [1].

A study conducted by researchers at MIT and Yale University challenges these conventional estimates, suggesting that the actual undocumented immigrant population could be roughly double the current official estimates [1]. This would place the number closer to 22-24 million people, representing a significant departure from widely accepted figures.

## Implications of Revised Estimates

The discrepancy between traditional estimates and newer research highlights the inherent challenges in counting a population that, by its nature, seeks to avoid official detection and enumeration [1]. The researchers' methodology attempts to account for limitations in previous counting methods that may have led to systematic undercounting.

It's important to note that estimating undocumented populations involves complex statistical modeling and various assumptions, which can lead to different conclusions depending on the approach taken.

MIT Sloan researchers present findings suggesting the undocumented immigrant population is roughly double current government estimates, challenging conventional wisdom about the scale of undocumented immigration in the United States. https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-undocumented-immigrant-population-roughly-double-current-estimate
