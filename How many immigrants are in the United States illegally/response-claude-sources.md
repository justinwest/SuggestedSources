The number of immigrants living in the United States illegally is a subject of significant debate, with estimates varying widely depending on methodology and data sources used.

## Current Official Estimates

The most commonly cited figures come from government agencies and academic institutions. The Department of Homeland Security and Pew Research Center have traditionally estimated the undocumented population at approximately 10-12 million people [1][2]. These estimates are based on census data, survey responses, and demographic modeling techniques.

## Alternative Higher Estimates

However, some researchers argue these traditional estimates significantly undercount the actual population. A notable 2018 study by researchers at MIT and Yale suggested the undocumented population could be substantially higher—potentially ranging from 16 to 29 million people, with their best estimate around 22 million [1]. This research used different mathematical models and argued that conventional methods may miss large portions of the undocumented population who avoid government surveys and census participation.

## Recent Border Encounters vs. Total Population

It's important to distinguish between recent border encounters and the total undocumented population residing in the country. According to House Homeland Security Committee data, there were nearly 3 million inadmissible encounters in fiscal year 2024, with 10.8 million total encounters since fiscal year 2021 [3]. However, these encounter numbers don't directly translate to net increases in the undocumented population, as they include individuals who were expelled, returned voluntarily, or processed through legal channels.

## Challenges in Accurate Counting

Determining precise numbers remains challenging because undocumented immigrants often avoid participation in official surveys and government data collection efforts. The hidden nature of this population makes any estimate inherently uncertain, leading to the wide range of figures cited by different sources [2][4].
