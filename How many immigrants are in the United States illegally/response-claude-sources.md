Based on the provided source, estimates of the undocumented immigrant population in the United States vary significantly depending on the methodology used.

## Current Official Estimates vs. Alternative Research

The traditional estimate, commonly cited by government agencies and widely accepted, places the undocumented immigrant population at approximately 11-12 million people [1]. However, recent academic research suggests this figure may be substantially underestimated.

## Higher Population Estimates

A study conducted by researchers at MIT and Yale presents evidence that the actual undocumented immigrant population could be roughly double the current official estimate [1]. This research suggests the true number may be closer to 22-24 million undocumented immigrants in the United States [1].

## Methodological Considerations

The significant discrepancy between these estimates highlights the inherent challenges in accurately counting a population that, by its nature, seeks to avoid detection by government authorities [1]. The MIT study indicates that traditional counting methods may have systematic limitations that lead to undercounting [1].

## Conclusion

While the commonly accepted estimate places the undocumented immigrant population at around 11-12 million, emerging research suggests the actual number could be approximately double that figure, potentially reaching 22-24 million people [1]. The wide range in these estimates underscores the complexity and uncertainty involved in measuring this population.
