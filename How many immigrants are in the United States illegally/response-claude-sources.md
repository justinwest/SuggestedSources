The number of undocumented immigrants living in the United States is a subject of ongoing debate, with estimates varying significantly depending on the methodology used and the source conducting the research.

## Current Mainstream Estimates

According to the most recent data from the Pew Research Center, approximately **14 million unauthorized immigrants** lived in the United States as of 2023, marking a record high [1]. This represents an increase from previous years, with Pew estimating 11 million in 2019 and 10.5 million in 2021 [1]. The 2023 figure constitutes about 4.2% of the total U.S. population [1].

The Department of Homeland Security provides similar estimates, calculating approximately **11 million unauthorized immigrants** as of January 2022 [2]. Other organizations like the Center for Migration Studies estimate the number at around **11.7 million** as of July 2023 [3].

## Alternative Higher Estimates

Some researchers argue that traditional estimation methods significantly undercount the actual unauthorized population. A 2018 study from MIT Sloan used mathematical modeling based on operational data and suggested the true number could be roughly double the conventional estimates, potentially ranging from **16.2 to 29.5 million**, with a mean estimate of **22.1 million** [4]. These researchers argued that traditional survey-based methods may miss significant portions of this population due to inherent limitations in data collection [4].

## Important Distinctions

It's crucial to distinguish between different immigration-related statistics that are sometimes conflated:

- **Unauthorized immigrant population**: People currently residing in the U.S. without legal status (the 11-14 million figure from mainstream estimates)
- **Border encounters**: The number of times border officials interact with migrants attempting to cross, which reached nearly 3 million in fiscal year 2024 [5]. These encounters don't equal the number of people, as the same individuals may be encountered multiple times, and many are immediately expelled or deported [2]
- **Inadmissible encounters**: Not all border encounters result in people entering or remaining in the country

## Methodology Considerations

The variation in estimates stems from different methodological approaches. Most mainstream estimates rely on the "residual method," which compares census data on foreign-born residents with administrative data on legal immigration [1][2]. Critics of this approach argue it may undercount individuals who avoid government surveys or live in hard-to-reach communities [4].

The most widely accepted current estimate is between **11-14 million unauthorized immigrants** living in the United States, though some researchers suggest the actual number could be significantly higher.
