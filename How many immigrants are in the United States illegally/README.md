# ü§ñ Claude's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

The number of undocumented immigrants living in the United States is a subject of ongoing debate, with estimates varying significantly depending on the methodology used and the source conducting the research.

## Current Mainstream Estimates

According to the most recent data from the Pew Research Center, approximately **14 million unauthorized immigrants** lived in the United States as of 2023, marking a record high [1]. This represents an increase from previous years, with Pew estimating 11 million in 2019 and 10.5 million in 2021 [1]. The 2023 figure constitutes about 4.2% of the total U.S. population [1].

The Department of Homeland Security provides similar estimates, calculating approximately **11 million unauthorized immigrants** as of January 2022 [2]. Other organizations like the Center for Migration Studies estimate the number at around **11.7 million** as of July 2023 [3].

## Alternative Higher Estimates

Some researchers argue that traditional estimation methods significantly undercount the actual unauthorized population. A 2018 study from MIT Sloan used mathematical modeling based on operational data and suggested the true number could be roughly double the conventional estimates, potentially ranging from **16.2 to 29.5 million**, with a mean estimate of **22.1 million** [4]. These researchers argued that traditional survey-based methods may miss significant portions of this population due to inherent limitations in data collection [4].

## Important Distinctions

It's crucial to distinguish between different immigration-related statistics that are sometimes conflated:

- **Unauthorized immigrant population**: People currently residing in the U.S. without legal status (the 11-14 million figure from mainstream estimates)
- **Border encounters**: The number of times border officials interact with migrants attempting to cross, which reached nearly 3 million in fiscal year 2024 [5]. These encounters don't equal the number of people, as the same individuals may be encountered multiple times, and many are immediately expelled or deported [2]
- **Inadmissible encounters**: Not all border encounters result in people entering or remaining in the country

## Methodology Considerations

The variation in estimates stems from different methodological approaches. Most mainstream estimates rely on the "residual method," which compares census data on foreign-born residents with administrative data on legal immigration [1][2]. Critics of this approach argue it may undercount individuals who avoid government surveys or live in hard-to-reach communities [4].

The most widely accepted current estimate is between **11-14 million unauthorized immigrants** living in the United States, though some researchers suggest the actual number could be significantly higher.

Short answer
- Best current estimate: about 14 million unauthorized (undocumented) immigrants lived in the U.S. in 2023, according to the latest comprehensive estimate from Pew Research Center [1].
- Other mainstream estimates in recent years had put the figure closer to 10‚Äì11 million, reflecting earlier years and different methods; that lower range still appears in 2024 reporting that explains the measurement challenges [2][3].
- A minority view from an MIT-linked study argues the true number could be far higher (around 22 million as of 2016), but this estimate is disputed and not used by most demographers [5].

Why the numbers differ
- Stock vs. flow: The ‚Äúunauthorized population‚Äù is a stock (how many people are residing in the country without authorization at a point in time). Border ‚Äúencounters‚Äù are flows (events), not residents, and include repeat crossers and people who are turned back or removed [2]. For example, a congressional fact sheet cites roughly 10.8 million encounters since FY2021 and nearly 3 million in FY2024 alone, but those figures cannot be added to estimate how many people currently live in the U.S. without authorization [4].
- Method and timing: Demographers typically estimate the unauthorized population by subtracting lawfully present foreign-born people from the total foreign-born population measured in large surveys, then adjusting for undercount. Different surveys, adjustments, and reference years can yield different results. Earlier mainstream estimates placed the population around 10‚Äì11 million, while newer work by Pew puts it at about 14 million in 2023, indicating growth in recent years [1][2][3].
- Outlier estimates: One academic approach using alternative modeling suggested a much higher number (16.7‚Äì29.5 million, centered near 22 million) for 2016, but this approach has been widely debated and has not been adopted by most researchers or official statistical agencies [5].

Bottom line
- The most credible, up-to-date point estimate is about 14 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. in 2023 [1].
- Reasonable recent estimates across mainstream sources span roughly 10‚Äì14 million, depending on the year measured and method used [1][2][3].
- Claims that simply add up border encounters to infer the resident unauthorized population are incorrect; encounters are not the same as people residing in the country [2][4].

# ü§ñ Gemini's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

There is no single, universally agreed-upon figure for the number of immigrants living illegally in the United States. Estimates vary significantly depending on the methodology, data sources, and the time period being analyzed. The most credible analyses place the number anywhere from just over 10 million to over 20 million people.

### Mainstream and Recent Estimates (10.7 to 14 Million)
Historically, the most widely cited estimates have placed the unauthorized immigrant population at around 11 million. The Department of Homeland Security estimated the population at 11 million in 2018, while the Pew Research Center placed it at 10.5 million in 2021 [2, 4]. These figures are typically calculated using the "residual method," which involves subtracting the number of legal foreign-born residents from the total foreign-born population captured in census data [4].

However, due to an increase in border crossings since 2021, most analysts agree that this population has grown. Reflecting this trend, some recent estimates are significantly higher:
*   **Center for Immigration Studies (CIS)**: This organization estimated that the unauthorized immigrant population reached 13.7 million at the beginning of 2024 [2].
*   **Projections for 2023**: Some analyses project that the population reached a record high of approximately 14 million in 2023, though a definitive report from major research centers for this period is not yet available [5].

### High-End Academic Estimate (22 Million)
A 2018 study from researchers at the MIT Sloan School of Management and the Yale School of Management produced a dramatically higher estimate. Using a mathematical model based on operational data‚Äîsuch as deportations, visa overstays, and mortality rates‚Äîrather than census surveys, the researchers concluded that the undocumented immigrant population was 22.1 million in 2016 [1]. This figure is roughly double the conventional estimates from the same period, and while it represents a different academic perspective, it is not as widely cited as the lower figures from organizations like the Pew Research Center [1, 4].

### Understanding Immigration Statistics: Population vs. "Encounters"
It is important to distinguish between the total population of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. (a "stock") and the number of border "encounters" (a "flow"). Government data often highlights the number of encounters, which are events, not unique individuals [2].

For example, the House Committee on Homeland Security reported nearly 3 million "inadmissible encounters" at the U.S. border in Fiscal Year 2024 and a total of 10.8 million encounters since the start of Fiscal Year 2021 [3]. However, these numbers include individuals who may have been stopped multiple times, as well as those who were immediately expelled and never entered the U.S. interior [2]. Therefore, encounter figures reflect the scale of attempted crossings but do not directly translate to the net increase in the number of unauthorized immigrants residing in the country [2, 3].

The number of unauthorized immigrants living in the United States is estimated to be between 10.5 and 12 million people as of recent estimates, though precise figures are inherently difficult to determine due to the population's undocumented nature.

## Current Estimates

According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), there were approximately 11 million unauthorized immigrants residing in the United States as of January 2022 [1]. This represents a slight increase from their 2020 estimate of 10.5 million [1]. The Pew Research Center, using different methodology, estimated the unauthorized immigrant population at 10.5 million in 2021, down from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007 [2].

The Migration Policy Institute (MPI) provides similar estimates, calculating approximately 11 million unauthorized immigrants as of 2021 [3]. These organizations use different methodological approaches but arrive at broadly similar figures, suggesting the estimates are relatively reliable within a margin of error.

## Historical Trends

The unauthorized immigrant population grew rapidly from the 1990s through 2007, when it reached its historical peak [2]. Since then, the numbers have remained relatively stable or slightly declined. The Great Recession of 2008-2009, increased border enforcement, and changing migration patterns from Mexico have all contributed to this stabilization [2][3].

## Demographics and Distribution

The largest share of unauthorized immigrants comes from Mexico, though this proportion has decreased over time. As of 2021, Mexicans made up about 37% of the unauthorized population, down from 57% in 2007 [2]. Other significant origin countries include El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, China, and India [3].

Geographically, unauthorized immigrants are concentrated in several states. California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois account for the majority of this population [1][3]. About two-thirds of unauthorized immigrants have lived in the United States for more than 10 years [2].

## Methodological Challenges

Estimating the unauthorized immigrant population involves significant challenges. Researchers typically use a "residual method," which compares the total foreign-born population (from Census data) with the legally present foreign-born population (from administrative records) [1][2]. The difference provides an estimate of the unauthorized population, though this method has inherent limitations and margins of error.

## Labor Force Participation

Unauthorized immigrants comprise approximately 4.6% of the U.S. civilian workforce, despite representing about 3.3% of the total U.S. population [2]. They are particularly concentrated in industries such as construction, agriculture, hospitality, and domestic services [3].

# ü§ñ ChatGPT's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

Short answer: The best available, nonpartisan estimates indicate that roughly 10.5‚Äì11 million unauthorized (undocumented) immigrants are living in the United States. Pew Research Center estimates 10.5 million in 2021, while the Center for Migration Studies estimates about 10.6 million in 2022. Both note the total remains below the 2007 peak of about 12.2 million, with modest growth since the late 2010s [1][2].

What that means and why estimates vary
- ‚ÄúUnauthorized‚Äù typically includes people who entered without inspection and people who overstayed a visa; it is a stock (how many live here now), not a count of annual border encounters or entries.
- No registry exists, so demographers infer the total by comparing survey counts of the foreign-born population to administrative records and modeling undercounts (the ‚Äúresidual‚Äù method). Different datasets, time lags, and undercount assumptions produce slightly different numbers, hence a narrow range rather than a single point estimate [1][2][4].
- Credible, mainstream demographers broadly converge around roughly 10‚Äì11 million. Some advocacy groups publish substantially higher figures (16‚Äì20+ million), but those estimates rest on different assumptions about survey undercounts and have been widely critiqued by population researchers [4][5][6].

Trends to know
- Peak and decline: The unauthorized population peaked around 12.2 million in 2007, fell during and after the Great Recession, and remained lower throughout the 2010s [1].
- Recent years: Estimates show stabilization or a modest uptick by 2021‚Äì2022 (about 10.5‚Äì10.6 million) but still below the 2007 peak [1][2]. Because official stock estimates lag by a year or more, the precise 2023‚Äì2024 total is not yet settled in the major datasets; demographers expect the number to be somewhat higher than in 2021, but not dramatically above the low- to mid-11 million range absent strong evidence to the contrary [1][2][3].

Bottom line: A reasonable, evidence-based statement is that about 11 million people are living in the U.S. without lawful immigration status, with most rigorous estimates landing between 10.5 and 11 million in 2021‚Äì2022 and suggesting modest growth since then [1][2][3].

# ü§ñ Gemini's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

Estimating the number of immigrants in the United States without legal authorization is a complex task, as there is no official government census of this population. Instead, government agencies, think tanks, and academic institutions produce estimates based on demographic and statistical analysis. Consequently, different sources provide slightly different numbers, but they generally fall within a specific range.

The most widely cited estimates for the unauthorized immigrant population in recent years place the figure between **10.3 million and 11 million**. However, these figures are typically based on data from 2021 or 2022. More recent analyses suggest a significant increase in this population since then due to a rise in net immigration.

### Key Estimates from Major Sources

1.  **Pew Research Center:** A leading source for this data, the Pew Research Center estimated that there were **10.5 million** unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in 2021. This number was largely unchanged from 2019 and represented a decline from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007. The population had remained relatively stable for over a decade prior to recent increases in border arrivals [1].

2.  **U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS):** The most recent official government estimate comes from the DHS, which reported that **11.0 million** unauthorized immigrants were living in the U.S. as of January 1, 2022. This figure marked a slight increase from the 10.5 million estimated in 2020 [2].

3.  **Center for Migration Studies (CMS):** CMS, a non-partisan think tank, estimated the unauthorized population to be **10.38 million** at the end of 2022. Their analysis noted that while arrivals have increased, the total population number has been moderated by other factors, such as departures, deaths, and adjustments of legal status [3].

### The Challenge of Counting and Recent Trends

These estimates are generally calculated using the "residual method." Researchers take the total number of foreign-born individuals living in the U.S. from surveys like the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) and subtract the number of legally resident foreign-born individuals. The remaining "residual" number is the estimated unauthorized population. This method has limitations, including potential undercounts in surveys and reliance on demographic assumptions.

Since the data for the estimates above were collected (mostly in 2021 and 2022), there has been a significant increase in migrant encounters at the U.S. southern border. This has led many analysts to conclude that the total unauthorized population has grown.

*   The **Congressional Budget Office (CBO)**, in a 2024 report, estimated that net immigration to the U.S. by people in the "other foreign national" category (a group that includes unauthorized immigrants) was 2.4 million in 2023, following 1.7 million in 2022. This data strongly suggests a substantial increase in the resident unauthorized population since the last comprehensive estimates were made [4].
*   The **Center for Immigration Studies (CIS)**, an organization that advocates for lower immigration, produced a higher and more recent estimate. They calculated that the unauthorized immigrant population reached **13.7 million** in January 2024, attributing the rapid growth directly to the increase in border encounters since 2021 [5].

### A Note on Terminology

The terminology used to describe this population is often a subject of debate.
*   **Unauthorized immigrant** and **undocumented immigrant** are terms commonly used by researchers, academic institutions, and many news organizations to describe individuals who entered the country without inspection or overstayed a valid visa.
*   **Illegal immigrant** is a term used by some government agencies and news outlets, but it is considered pejorative by many immigrant advocacy groups and has become less common in academic and journalistic writing.

In summary, while the most established, peer-reviewed estimates place the unauthorized immigrant population at around 10.5 to 11 million based on 2021-2022 data, more recent analysis accounting for the surge in migration since then suggests the current number is likely significantly higher, possibly in the range of 12 to 14 million.
