# ü§ñ Claude's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

The number of immigrants living in the United States illegally is a subject of significant debate, with estimates varying widely depending on methodology and data sources used.

## Current Official Estimates

The most commonly cited figures come from government agencies and academic institutions. The Department of Homeland Security and Pew Research Center have traditionally estimated the undocumented population at approximately 10-12 million people [1][2]. These estimates are based on census data, survey responses, and demographic modeling techniques.

## Alternative Higher Estimates

However, some researchers argue these traditional estimates significantly undercount the actual population. A notable 2018 study by researchers at MIT and Yale suggested the undocumented population could be substantially higher‚Äîpotentially ranging from 16 to 29 million people, with their best estimate around 22 million [1]. This research used different mathematical models and argued that conventional methods may miss large portions of the undocumented population who avoid government surveys and census participation.

## Recent Border Encounters vs. Total Population

It's important to distinguish between recent border encounters and the total undocumented population residing in the country. According to House Homeland Security Committee data, there were nearly 3 million inadmissible encounters in fiscal year 2024, with 10.8 million total encounters since fiscal year 2021 [3]. However, these encounter numbers don't directly translate to net increases in the undocumented population, as they include individuals who were expelled, returned voluntarily, or processed through legal channels.

## Challenges in Accurate Counting

Determining precise numbers remains challenging because undocumented immigrants often avoid participation in official surveys and government data collection efforts. The hidden nature of this population makes any estimate inherently uncertain, leading to the wide range of figures cited by different sources [2][4].

Estimates of how many immigrants are in the United States illegally vary, and there is no exact count due to the inherent difficulty of measuring this population. A prominent **2018 study by MIT and Yale researchers** suggested that the number of undocumented immigrants could be about **22 million**, roughly double the traditionally cited estimate ([mitsloan.mit.edu](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-undocumented-immigrant-population-roughly-double-current-estimate#:~:text=The%20research%20found%20that%20the,Kaplan%20and%20Jonathan%20Feinstein%2C%20both)). This higher estimate was derived using alternative methods (relying on operational data like visa overstays and deportations) and was meant to account for possible undercounting in surveys. Most demographers and government agencies, however, **put the figure much lower** ‚Äì on the order of **10 to 12 million**. In fact, the **U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)** estimated about **11 million** unauthorized immigrants living in the country as of January 2022 ([feeds.bbci.co.uk](https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/articles/c0jp4xqx2z3o#:~:text=The%20US%20Department%20of%20Homeland,US%20as%20of%20January%202022)). This widely accepted estimate has remained around 11 million for many years, indicating that the unauthorized population grew rapidly in the 1990s and early 2000s but then leveled off and even declined slightly in the late 2000s and 2010s. (DHS data show that about one-fifth of the 11 million arrived in 2010 or later, while the **majority have lived in the U.S. for decades** ([feeds.bbci.co.uk](https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/articles/c0jp4xqx2z3o#:~:text=The%20US%20Department%20of%20Homeland,US%20as%20of%20January%202022)).)

**Recent surges in border crossings** have led to additional estimates and political claims that deserve context. Under the Biden administration, record numbers of migrants have been encountered at the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border. **U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)** has recorded **over 10 million ‚Äúencounters‚Äù** with migrants at the borders since early 2021 ([ebs.publicnow.com](https://ebs.publicnow.com/view/C42F6837FF6C8AB74B74345B551E30A046AAEC52#:~:text=Yet%20again%20under%20President%20Biden%2C,9%20million%20nationwide%20encounters)). (Encounters include people stopped crossing illegally plus those deemed inadmissible at ports of entry.) Some politicians have cited this 8‚Äì10 million figure to claim an unprecedented wave of *millions* of new illegal immigrants in the country. **Fact-checkers note this is misleading** because **‚Äúencounters‚Äù are not the same as individuals settling in the U.S.** ‚Äì many migrants are counted multiple times or quickly expelled. For example, about **2.8 million of those recent encounters resulted in immediate removal or expulsion** (often under pandemic-era rules), and others were repeat attempts by the same people ([www.factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/#:~:text=The%20figures%20used%20by%20Haley%2C,encountered%20are%20not%20simply%20released)). In total, well over half of all migrants encountered at the southwest border in the last few years *did not stay* in the U.S. but were turned back ([www.factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/#:~:text=Total%20DHS%20repatriations%20through%20October,and%20removal%20operations%2C%E2%80%9D%20DHS%20explains)). (Even the raw encounter counts exclude ‚Äúgotaways‚Äù ‚Äì those who evaded capture ‚Äì estimated at around 1.6‚Äì1.7 million in the 2021‚Äì2023 period ([www.factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/#:~:text=authorities,from%20February%202021%20through%20October)) ([www.factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/01/factchecking-the-haley-desantis-gop-debate/#:~:text=Since%20Biden%20took%20office%20in,border%20illegally%20without%20being%20apprehended)).) The bottom line is that while the **unauthorized population has likely grown somewhat in recent years**, it has **not increased by the full 8‚Äì10 million** often cited from border statistics ([www.factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/#:~:text=The%20figures%20used%20by%20Haley%2C,encountered%20are%20not%20simply%20released)).

In summary, **most experts estimate** that roughly **11 million** immigrants are living in the United States without legal status, give or take a million or two. This remains the ballpark figure used in official reports and research. However, there is **some debate**: one academic study argues the true number could be significantly higher (in the 16‚Äì22 million range) ([mitsloan.mit.edu](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-undocumented-immigrant-population-roughly-double-current-estimate#:~:text=The%20research%20found%20that%20the,Kaplan%20and%20Jonathan%20Feinstein%2C%20both)), while on the other hand, political talking points sometimes inflate the figure by conflating short-term border apprehensions with long-term residents ([www.factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/#:~:text=The%20figures%20used%20by%20Haley%2C,encountered%20are%20not%20simply%20released)). As of now, a reasonable estimate is on the order of **ten to twelve million undocumented immigrants** in the U.S., acknowledging uncertainty and the possibility of undercounting. All sources agree that **millions of these individuals have been residing in the country for many years**, and the population‚Äôs growth has been relatively modest compared to the large inflows suggested by recent border encounter numbers ([feeds.bbci.co.uk](https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/articles/c0jp4xqx2z3o#:~:text=The%20US%20Department%20of%20Homeland,US%20as%20of%20January%202022)) ([www.factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/#:~:text=The%20figures%20used%20by%20Haley%2C,encountered%20are%20not%20simply%20released)).

The article notes that around 2.8 million of those encounters were quickly **removed or expelled**, and many others were repeat crossers ‚Äì so the net additions to the undocumented population are far smaller ([www.factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/#:~:text=The%20figures%20used%20by%20Haley%2C,encountered%20are%20not%20simply%20released)). *([FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/) ‚Äì Emphasizes context and clarifies that encounters ‚â† residents)*

Determining the exact number of immigrants living in the U.S. without authorization is challenging, as there is no official count. Instead, government agencies, think tanks, and academic researchers produce estimates that vary based on their methodologies. These estimates range from approximately 10.5 million to over 22 million.

### Competing Estimates of the Total Undocumented Population

The most commonly cited estimates place the total unauthorized immigrant population between 10 and 11 million.
*   **Pew Research Center:** One of the most frequently referenced sources, the Pew Research Center, estimated there were 10.5 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in 2021. This number has remained relatively stable since 2009, after peaking at 12.2 million in 2007 [2].
*   **Department of Homeland Security (DHS):** The DHS's most recent official estimate, as of January 2022, placed the number at 11.0 million [2].

However, a 2018 study by researchers from MIT Sloan and Yale University presented a significantly higher figure. Using mathematical modeling on demographic and immigration data from 1990 to 2016, they concluded that the standard estimates were too low.
*   **MIT/Yale Study:** Their research model calculated a mean estimate of **22.1 million** undocumented immigrants residing in the U.S. in 2016. The authors argue that previous models may have underestimated inflows and overestimated outflows, leading to a lower count [1].

### Distinguishing Total Population from Border Encounters

It is crucial to distinguish the total undocumented population (a "stock" figure) from the number of border encounters (a "flow" figure). Recent news has focused on a surge in encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border, but these numbers do not represent the net increase in the long-term undocumented population [2, 4].

*   **Border Encounters:** This metric counts the number of times authorities apprehend or expel individuals attempting to cross the border, not the number of unique people. One person can be counted multiple times if they make multiple attempts [2]. According to a factsheet from the House Committee on Homeland Security, there were nearly 3 million "inadmissible encounters" in Fiscal Year 2024 and a total of **10.8 million** encounters since the start of Fiscal Year 2021 [3].
*   **"Gotaways":** This term refers to individuals who U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) detects but is unable to apprehend. The House Committee on Homeland Security reports that there have been over 2 million known "gotaways" since Fiscal Year 2021 [3]. While these individuals contribute to the undocumented population, the number is an estimate, and it is separate from the total number of encounters.

In summary, while official and commonly cited estimates suggest a stable undocumented population of around 10.5 to 11 million people, some academic models propose the number could be as high as 22 million. Recent, high-profile figures on border crossings reflect the *flow* of migrants and do not directly translate to the total number of undocumented immigrants living in the country long-term [2, 4].

# ü§ñ Grok's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

Estimating the number of immigrants living in the United States illegally (often referred to as undocumented or unauthorized immigrants) is challenging due to the clandestine nature of the population, differences in methodologies, and ongoing debates over data sources. Official and academic estimates typically range from about 11 million to over 22 million, depending on the source and time frame. These figures represent the "stock" of undocumented individuals residing in the U.S., not the "flow" of new arrivals or border encounters. Below, I'll break down the key estimates from reliable sources, including variations and recent trends, while noting that no single figure is definitive due to undercounting and methodological differences.

### Conventional Estimates
The most widely cited estimates come from government agencies and nonpartisan research organizations, which generally place the undocumented population at around 11-12 million as of recent years. For instance:
- The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimated there were approximately 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. as of January 2018, with the population remaining relatively stable since 2012 [5].
- Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan think tank, reported about 11.0 million unauthorized immigrants in 2022, up slightly from 10.5 million in 2021. This represents about 3% of the total U.S. population and 22% of the foreign-born population. Pew's methodology relies on "residual" estimation, subtracting legal immigrants from total foreign-born counts in census data [6].
- These figures align with analyses from FactCheck.org, which notes that the undocumented population has hovered around 11 million for over a decade, though it acknowledges potential undercounts and recent increases due to border surges [2].

These conventional estimates are based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey and adjustments for underreporting. They suggest the population peaked at 12.2 million in 2007, declined during the Great Recession, and has since stabilized or grown modestly [6].

### Higher Estimates and Critiques
Some studies challenge these numbers, arguing that traditional methods undercount the population. A notable example is a 2018 study from MIT Sloan School of Management and Yale researchers, which used mathematical modeling incorporating deportation rates, border apprehensions, visa overstays, and voluntary emigration. It estimated the undocumented population at 22.1 million as of 2016‚Äîroughly double the conventional estimate of 11.3 million at the time [1]. The study suggested that undercounting occurs because official surveys miss hidden populations, and it projected the number could be even higher if trends continued.

This higher estimate has been influential but controversial. Critics, including Pew researchers, argue it relies on assumptions that may overestimate inflows and underestimate outflows (e.g., returns to home countries) [6]. FactCheck.org also references this debate, noting that while the MIT study highlights potential flaws in official counts, it hasn't been widely adopted as the standard [2].

### Impact of Recent Immigration Trends
Recent border encounters have led to speculation about growth in the undocumented population. Since Fiscal Year 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has reported over 10.8 million migrant encounters at the southwest border, including 8.2 million under the Biden administration through FY2024 [3]. However, these are not direct additions to the undocumented population:
- Many encounters result in expulsions, releases, or asylum claims rather than permanent residency.
- A BBC analysis estimates that about 2.5 million people may have entered and stayed illegally since 2021, potentially increasing the total undocumented population [4].
- FactCheck.org clarifies that of the roughly 8 million encounters under Biden (through early 2024), about 3.3 million were expelled, 2.5 million were released into the U.S. pending proceedings, and others were processed differently. This could add 1-2 million net to the undocumented count, but precise figures are elusive due to unknowns like "got-aways" (estimated at 1.8 million since FY2021) [2][3].

Adjusting for these trends, some updated projections suggest the current undocumented population could be 12-13 million or higher. For example, the Migration Policy Institute estimates around 11.3 million as of 2022 but notes potential growth from recent asylum seekers and visa overstays [7].

### Factors Influencing Estimates
- **Methodological Differences**: Official counts use census data and residuals, while alternative models like MIT's incorporate broader variables. Visa overstays account for about 40-50% of the undocumented population, per DHS [5].
- **Demographics**: About 75% of undocumented immigrants are from Mexico and Central America, with growing numbers from South America and Asia [6].
- **Policy Impacts**: Policies like Title 42 (used for rapid expulsions during the COVID-19 pandemic) and asylum backlogs affect how many stay [2][4].
- **Uncertainty**: All estimates have margins of error; Pew's is ¬±400,000 for recent years [6]. The actual number could be higher due to uncounted "got-aways" or lower if outflows (e.g., deportations, which totaled 1.5 million since FY2021 [3]) are underestimated.

In summary, the most commonly accepted estimate is around 11-12 million, but higher figures like 22 million from the MIT study highlight ongoing debates. Recent border activity suggests modest growth, potentially pushing the total to 13 million or more by 2024. For the latest data, consulting DHS or Pew is recommended, as numbers can change with new reports.

# ü§ñ Claude's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

The number of immigrants living in the United States without legal authorization is estimated to be between 10.5 and 12 million people as of recent years, though precise counts are inherently difficult due to the undocumented nature of this population [1][2].

## Current Estimates

According to the Pew Research Center, approximately 10.5 million unauthorized immigrants lived in the U.S. as of 2017, representing about 3.2% of the total U.S. population [1]. The Department of Homeland Security estimated a similar figure of 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants as of January 2018 [2]. More recent estimates from various research organizations suggest the number has remained relatively stable, ranging between 10.5 and 12 million [3].

## Methodology and Challenges

These estimates are derived through statistical modeling rather than direct counting, as unauthorized immigrants are not systematically tracked. Researchers typically use the "residual method," which involves:

- Starting with total foreign-born population counts from the U.S. Census
- Subtracting the number of legal immigrants based on government records
- Adjusting for undercounting in census data [1][4]

The inherent limitations of this approach mean that estimates can vary significantly between organizations and time periods.

## Historical Trends

The unauthorized immigrant population grew rapidly from the 1990s through the mid-2000s, peaking at approximately 12.2 million in 2007. Since then, the numbers have either declined or remained relatively stable, influenced by factors including:

- Economic conditions in both the U.S. and origin countries
- Immigration enforcement policies
- Border security measures
- Changes in migration patterns [1][5]

## Geographic and Demographic Distribution

The unauthorized immigrant population is concentrated in certain states, with California, Texas, Florida, New York, and New Jersey hosting the largest numbers. Approximately 75% of unauthorized immigrants have lived in the U.S. for more than 10 years as of recent estimates [1][6].

## Data Limitations

It's important to note that all figures are estimates with margins of error. The undocumented nature of this population, combined with concerns about participating in government surveys, makes precise enumeration impossible. Different methodological approaches can yield varying results, and estimates should be understood as approximations rather than exact counts [4].

# ü§ñ ChatGPT's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

## Current Estimates and Range  
Estimates of the number of immigrants living in the United States without legal authorization typically range around **11 million** in recent years. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimated 11.0 million unauthorized immigrants as of January 2022 [1]. Likewise, the Pew Research Center calculated that the unauthorized immigrant population was about **11.0 million in 2022**, up from roughly 10.5 million in 2021 [2]. Demographic research groups using similar methodologies ‚Äì including Pew, DHS, and independent demographers ‚Äì consistently find totals in the **10‚Äì12 million** range for the current unauthorized population [1][2]. This figure generally includes people often termed ‚Äúundocumented‚Äù or ‚Äúillegal‚Äù immigrants, encompassing those who entered unlawfully or overstayed visas (and often counting individuals with temporary protections like DACA or Temporary Protected Status as they lack permanent residency) [2]. While it is impossible to know the exact number, **most credible estimates cluster around the low tens of millions**, rather than dramatically higher figures [1][3].

## Historical Trends  
The population of unauthorized immigrants has fluctuated over time. It **peaked in the mid-2000s** at around 12 million ‚Äì for instance, reaching an estimated **12.2 million in 2007**, according to Pew Research [2]. Following that peak, the number **declined during the late 2000s and 2010s**, dropping in part due to tighter enforcement and the Great Recession. By around 2019‚Äì2020, the unauthorized population had fallen to roughly **10 million** ‚Äì its lowest level in over a decade [3]. For more than ten years the total hovered relatively stable (on the order of 10‚Äì11 million) as new arrivals were offset by departures, deaths, or people gaining legal status [1][4]. However, in the early 2020s the trend **reversed**: the unauthorized immigrant population has been **rising again**. Estimates show growth from 2021 onward ‚Äì for example, Pew noted an increase from 10.5 million (2021) to 11.0 million (2022) [2]. This recent uptick has been attributed to factors such as record migrant arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border, humanitarian entrants, and slower outflow, leading to the first significant growth in this population since the early 2000s [2][4].

## Methodologies and Variations in Estimates  
Because unauthorized immigrants are not directly counted by any registry, these figures are **estimates derived from survey and census data**. Demographers typically use the ‚Äúresidual method,‚Äù **subtracting the legally resident foreign-born population from the total foreign-born population** in Census Bureau surveys (like the American Community Survey), then adjusting for undercounting of undocumented individuals [2][4]. This method is used by DHS and nonpartisan research institutes (Pew, Migration Policy Institute, Center for Migration Studies, etc.), and their results tend to align within a similar range [2]. **Minor variations** in estimates occur due to different data sources or assumptions about undercounts. For example, the Center for Migration Studies (CMS) estimated about **10.9 million** undocumented residents in 2022 and roughly **11.7 million as of mid-2023** (still below the 2008 peak) [3]. In contrast, the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) recently revised its methodology to better account for missed immigrants in surveys, yielding a higher estimate of approximately **13.7 million unauthorized immigrants as of mid-2023** ‚Äì a potential record high if accurate [4]. Most experts consider the true figure to be in the **low- to mid-teens of millions at most**, and one demographer notes that any estimate outside the **11 to 13 million** range should be viewed with skepticism [3].

## Misconceptions and Higher Claims  
From time to time, much **larger figures** are claimed in public debate, but these are not supported by empirical data. Some advocacy groups favoring strict immigration limits have put out higher estimates (for instance, one such group claimed over 16 million in recent years) ‚Äì still well below the **20‚Äì30 million** that certain political statements have alleged [4]. Fact-check analyses have debunked the notion of 20+ million undocumented immigrants as **false** [4]. The misunderstanding often arises from conflating border arrest statistics with population size. It‚Äôs important to note that a record number of border ‚Äúencounters‚Äù (apprehensions) in a year does **not translate one-for-one into new residents** ‚Äì the same individual may attempt to cross multiple times, and many migrants are promptly expelled or returned rather than settling in the U.S. [4]. Moreover, the unauthorized population is not static; people continuously **exit the undocumented pool** by leaving the country, attaining legal status, or through natural causes (and others enter or are born into it), so the net growth is far lower than gross border crossing numbers [1][4]. In summary, the **best available evidence indicates on the order of 11 to 12 million** immigrants living in the U.S. without legal status, a level that has **risen modestly in recent years** but remains far below extreme claims [2][4].

# ü§ñ Gemini's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

Determining the exact number of immigrants in the United States without legal authorization is a complex task, as this population is not officially tracked. However, government agencies and non-partisan research organizations produce regular, reliable estimates using sophisticated statistical methods.

The most widely accepted estimates place the number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. at between **10.5 million and 11 million**.

It is important to note that researchers and government bodies typically use terms like "unauthorized," "undocumented," or "without legal status" rather than "illegal" to describe the population's civil immigration status, as opposed to a criminal one.

### Key Estimates from Major Sources

Different organizations produce slightly different estimates based on the data sets and time periods they analyze, but their findings are largely consistent.

1.  **Pew Research Center:** The Pew Research Center, a leading non-partisan think tank, estimated that there were **10.5 million** unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in 2021. This was the first increase in this population since its peak in 2007 [1].

2.  **U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS):** The most recent official government estimate comes from the DHS Office of Immigration Statistics. It estimated that **11.0 million** unauthorized immigrants were living in the United. States as of January 1, 2022. This figure represents an increase from their 2021 estimate of 10.5 million [2].

3.  **Center for Migration Studies (CMS):** CMS, a non-partisan research institute, estimated the undocumented population to be **10.37 million** in 2021. Their analysis also highlights that a significant majority of this population has resided in the U.S. for many years [3].

### Understanding the Methodology

These are not simple headcounts. The numbers are estimates derived primarily through a **residual method**. The process generally works as follows:

*   **Start with a Total:** Researchers begin with the total number of foreign-born individuals living in the U.S., which is determined through large-scale demographic surveys like the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS).
*   **Subtract the Legal Population:** They then subtract the number of foreign-born residents who are known to be living in the country legally. This number is calculated using administrative records from government agencies like DHS and the State Department, and includes lawful permanent residents (green card holders), naturalized citizens, and individuals on various long-term temporary visas (like H-1B or F-1 visas).
*   **The Remainder is the Estimate:** The remaining population‚Äîthe "residual"‚Äîis the estimated unauthorized immigrant population. Researchers then make statistical adjustments to account for potential survey undercounts and other variables.

### Recent Trends and Demographics

The data reveals several important trends about this population:

*   **Overall Population Trend:** The unauthorized immigrant population peaked at 12.2 million in 2007 and then steadily declined for more than a decade. The recent estimates for 2021 and 2022 mark the first significant increase since that peak [1, 2].
*   **Mode of Arrival:** A common misconception is that all unauthorized immigrants cross the border without inspection. However, a significant portion arrived legally on temporary visas and then remained in the country after their visa expired. DHS estimates that "nonimmigrant overstays" have accounted for over 40% of the growth in the unauthorized population in recent years [4].
*   **Country of Origin:** While immigrants from Mexico still make up the largest single group, their numbers have declined significantly since 2007. The population has become more diverse, with growth in the number of unauthorized immigrants from Central America (notably El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras), Asia, and other regions [1].
*   **Length of Residence:** The unauthorized immigrant population is increasingly long-settled. In 2021, the median length of residence in the U.S. for an unauthorized immigrant adult was 15.9 years, meaning a majority arrived before 2006. Nearly two-thirds of unauthorized immigrants have lived in the U.S. for 10 years or more [1].

# ü§ñ Grok's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

### Overview of Unauthorized Immigrants in the United States

The question refers to the number of immigrants living in the United States without legal authorization, commonly known as unauthorized, undocumented, or illegal immigrants. This population includes individuals who entered the country without inspection (e.g., crossing the border unlawfully) or who overstayed valid visas, but excludes those with temporary protections like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in most estimates [1]. Estimating this number is challenging due to the clandestine nature of unauthorized migration, reliance on indirect methods (e.g., residual estimation from census data), and variations in data sources and methodologies. Official and nonpartisan estimates typically range from 10 to 12 million, while some advocacy groups provide higher figures [2][3].

### Current Estimates
According to the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan think tank, there were approximately 11.0 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. as of 2022. This represents a slight increase from 10.5 million in 2021, driven partly by post-pandemic migration trends, but it remains below the peak of 12.2 million in 2007 [1]. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), using a similar residual method (subtracting legal immigrants from total foreign-born populations in surveys), estimated 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants in January 2018, the most recent year for their detailed report [2]. The Migration Policy Institute (MPI), another independent research organization, aligns closely with these figures, estimating about 11.3 million in 2019, with breakdowns showing that roughly 77% are from Latin America, particularly Mexico (about 4.8 million) [3].

In contrast, some organizations with a focus on immigration restriction, such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), argue that official estimates undercount the population due to factors like underreporting in censuses and recent border encounters. FAIR estimates around 16.8 million unauthorized immigrants as of 2023, incorporating assumptions about uncounted entries and overstays [4]. However, these higher figures are often criticized by demographers for methodological flaws, such as overreliance on apprehension data without accounting for departures or legalizations [1][3].

### Historical Trends and Demographics
The unauthorized immigrant population grew rapidly from about 3.5 million in 1990 to a high of 12.2 million in 2007, then declined during the Great Recession due to economic factors and increased enforcement [1]. It stabilized around 11 million in the 2010s and has seen modest growth recently, influenced by global events like the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical instability [2]. Demographically:
- **Origin**: About 49% are from Mexico, though this share has declined as migration from Central America, Asia, and Africa has increased [1].
- **Geography**: California (1.9 million), Texas (1.7 million), Florida (1.0 million), and New York (0.7 million) host the largest populations [3].
- **Duration and Status**: Roughly 66% have lived in the U.S. for over a decade, and about 22% are under 18 years old. An estimated 4.4 million U.S.-born children live with at least one unauthorized parent [1].
- **Workforce Impact**: Unauthorized immigrants make up about 4.6% of the U.S. workforce, concentrated in industries like construction, agriculture, and hospitality [3].

These estimates are derived from sources like the American Community Survey (ACS) and Current Population Survey (CPS), adjusted for undercounts (typically 10-15%) [2]. Uncertainties arise from events like the 2022-2023 border surge, where over 2 million encounters occurred, but many resulted in expulsions or asylum claims rather than long-term unauthorized residence [1].

### Factors Influencing Estimates and Challenges
Methodologies vary: Nonpartisan sources like Pew and DHS use "residual" techniques, comparing total foreign-born populations to known legal residents [1][2]. Advocacy groups may extrapolate from border data or surveys, leading to discrepancies [4]. The actual number could fluctuate due to:
- **Entries and Exits**: Annual inflows (e.g., 700,000-800,000 visa overstays and unlawful entries) are offset by departures, deaths, and status adjustments [3].
- **Policy Changes**: Programs like DACA protect about 600,000 individuals, who are often excluded from unauthorized counts [1].
- **Data Gaps**: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted surveys, and the 2020 Census may have undercounted immigrants [3].

For the most accurate, up-to-date figures, refer to ongoing research from Pew or DHS, as estimates are periodically revised. If the question seeks data on specific subgroups (e.g., by state or origin), more granular reports are available [3].
