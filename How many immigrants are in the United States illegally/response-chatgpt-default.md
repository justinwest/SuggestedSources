## Current Estimates and Range  
Estimates of the number of immigrants living in the United States without legal authorization typically range around **11 million** in recent years. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimated 11.0 million unauthorized immigrants as of January 2022 [1]. Likewise, the Pew Research Center calculated that the unauthorized immigrant population was about **11.0 million in 2022**, up from roughly 10.5 million in 2021 [2]. Demographic research groups using similar methodologies – including Pew, DHS, and independent demographers – consistently find totals in the **10–12 million** range for the current unauthorized population [1][2]. This figure generally includes people often termed “undocumented” or “illegal” immigrants, encompassing those who entered unlawfully or overstayed visas (and often counting individuals with temporary protections like DACA or Temporary Protected Status as they lack permanent residency) [2]. While it is impossible to know the exact number, **most credible estimates cluster around the low tens of millions**, rather than dramatically higher figures [1][3].

## Historical Trends  
The population of unauthorized immigrants has fluctuated over time. It **peaked in the mid-2000s** at around 12 million – for instance, reaching an estimated **12.2 million in 2007**, according to Pew Research [2]. Following that peak, the number **declined during the late 2000s and 2010s**, dropping in part due to tighter enforcement and the Great Recession. By around 2019–2020, the unauthorized population had fallen to roughly **10 million** – its lowest level in over a decade [3]. For more than ten years the total hovered relatively stable (on the order of 10–11 million) as new arrivals were offset by departures, deaths, or people gaining legal status [1][4]. However, in the early 2020s the trend **reversed**: the unauthorized immigrant population has been **rising again**. Estimates show growth from 2021 onward – for example, Pew noted an increase from 10.5 million (2021) to 11.0 million (2022) [2]. This recent uptick has been attributed to factors such as record migrant arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border, humanitarian entrants, and slower outflow, leading to the first significant growth in this population since the early 2000s [2][4].

## Methodologies and Variations in Estimates  
Because unauthorized immigrants are not directly counted by any registry, these figures are **estimates derived from survey and census data**. Demographers typically use the “residual method,” **subtracting the legally resident foreign-born population from the total foreign-born population** in Census Bureau surveys (like the American Community Survey), then adjusting for undercounting of undocumented individuals [2][4]. This method is used by DHS and nonpartisan research institutes (Pew, Migration Policy Institute, Center for Migration Studies, etc.), and their results tend to align within a similar range [2]. **Minor variations** in estimates occur due to different data sources or assumptions about undercounts. For example, the Center for Migration Studies (CMS) estimated about **10.9 million** undocumented residents in 2022 and roughly **11.7 million as of mid-2023** (still below the 2008 peak) [3]. In contrast, the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) recently revised its methodology to better account for missed immigrants in surveys, yielding a higher estimate of approximately **13.7 million unauthorized immigrants as of mid-2023** – a potential record high if accurate [4]. Most experts consider the true figure to be in the **low- to mid-teens of millions at most**, and one demographer notes that any estimate outside the **11 to 13 million** range should be viewed with skepticism [3].

## Misconceptions and Higher Claims  
From time to time, much **larger figures** are claimed in public debate, but these are not supported by empirical data. Some advocacy groups favoring strict immigration limits have put out higher estimates (for instance, one such group claimed over 16 million in recent years) – still well below the **20–30 million** that certain political statements have alleged [4]. Fact-check analyses have debunked the notion of 20+ million undocumented immigrants as **false** [4]. The misunderstanding often arises from conflating border arrest statistics with population size. It’s important to note that a record number of border “encounters” (apprehensions) in a year does **not translate one-for-one into new residents** – the same individual may attempt to cross multiple times, and many migrants are promptly expelled or returned rather than settling in the U.S. [4]. Moreover, the unauthorized population is not static; people continuously **exit the undocumented pool** by leaving the country, attaining legal status, or through natural causes (and others enter or are born into it), so the net growth is far lower than gross border crossing numbers [1][4]. In summary, the **best available evidence indicates on the order of 11 to 12 million** immigrants living in the U.S. without legal status, a level that has **risen modestly in recent years** but remains far below extreme claims [2][4].

Uribe reports that the Department of Homeland Security estimated about *11.0 million* unauthorized immigrants as of 2022 (up from 10.5 million in 2020), and experts from nonpartisan organizations agree the figure is roughly *11–12 million*.

He emphasizes that any current estimate outside roughly *11–13 million* should be treated with skepticism, as speculative higher figures have repeatedly proven inaccurate ([cmsny.org](https://cmsny.org/us-undocumented-population-increased-in-july-2023-warren-090624/?os=avefgi&ref=app#:~:text=The%20total%20undocumented%20population%20increased,2001%20%28Figure%202)) ([cmsny.org](https://cmsny.org/us-undocumented-population-increased-in-july-2023-warren-090624/?os=avefgi&ref=app#:~:text=The%20large%20speculative%20numbers%20described,of%20their%20data%20and%20methodology)).
