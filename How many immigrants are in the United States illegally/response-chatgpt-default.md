How many immigrants are in the United States illegally?

Short answer
Because the U.S. government does not keep a registry of people who are in the country without authorization, the figure can only be estimated. The four major, regularly updated estimates all cluster in a narrow band:

  • Department of Homeland Security, Office of Immigration Statistics (DHS-OIS, January 2022): about 11.0 million (90 % range: 10.3–11.9 million).  
  • Pew Research Center (2021 data released in 2023): 10.5 million (rounded; 9.5–11.5 million plausible range).  
  • Center for Migration Studies (CMS, January 2022): 11.4 million.  
  • Congressional Budget Office (CBO, May 2023 baseline): 11.4 million, with an uncertainty band of roughly 10–12 million.

Taking these together, the best single-sentence summary is:

Approximately 10½–11½ million people—about 3 % of the U.S. population and roughly one-fifth of all foreign-born residents—are living in the United States without legal authorization.

Why the number is an estimate
1. There is no exit-control system that records every departure, so “visa over-stayers” must be inferred from multiple databases.  
2. Unauthorized border crossers are, by definition, not recorded.  
3. Surveys such as the American Community Survey (ACS) miss some portion of a population that has an incentive to avoid official contact.  
4. All major estimates therefore use a “residual” methodology:  
   a. Start with the total foreign-born population reported in the ACS or CPS.  
   b. Subtract everyone who can be matched to a legal status (naturalized citizens, lawful permanent residents, refugees, certain non-immigrant visa holders, etc.).  
   c. Apply adjustments for undercount, mortality, and emigration.  
   d. The remainder is classified as the unauthorized population.

Trends over time
• Peak: Around 12.2–12.3 million in 2007 (before the Great Recession).  
• Decline: Fell to about 11 million by 2009 and stayed near that level for a decade.  
• Post-2019: Little net change through the pandemic; 2021–2023 encounters at the southern border have been exceptionally high, but so have expulsions and Title 42 returns. Most demographers believe the population ticked up modestly, but not enough to break out of the 10–12 million band.

Composition (Pew 2021 unless noted)
Country/region of birth (shares rounded):
  – Mexico: 48 % (down from 57 % in 2007)  
  – Northern Triangle (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador): 16 %  
  – Asia (principally China, India, Philippines, Vietnam, Korea): 12 %  
  – Other Latin America/Caribbean: 11 %  
  – Europe/Canada/Oceania: 5 %  
  – Africa & Middle East: 4 %

Entry pathway:
  – Roughly 58 % crossed a land or maritime border without inspection.  
  – Roughly 42 % entered legally and overstayed a temporary visa (DHS Overstay Report, FY 2022).

Geography within the U.S. (CMS 2022):
  – California (~2.2 million), Texas (~1.7 million), Florida (~900 k), New York (~800 k), New Jersey (~500 k), Illinois (~450 k) together house over half of all unauthorized immigrants.

Uncertainty and caveats
• Sampling error in large surveys means any single-point estimate can be off by hundreds of thousands.  
• Recent migrants are the hardest to enumerate; real-time numbers during surges can be temporarily higher or lower than annual averages.  
• Policy changes that grant legal status (e.g., Temporary Protected Status designations, DACA renewals, parole programs) can instantly move tens of thousands out of the “unauthorized” category even though they remain foreign-born residents.

Bottom line
All reputable research organizations place the number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States at roughly 10 million to 12 million, with the consensus midpoint a little above 11 million as of early-2024.
