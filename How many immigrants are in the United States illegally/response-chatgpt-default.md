Short answer: The best available, nonpartisan estimates indicate that roughly 10.5–11 million unauthorized (undocumented) immigrants are living in the United States. Pew Research Center estimates 10.5 million in 2021, while the Center for Migration Studies estimates about 10.6 million in 2022. Both note the total remains below the 2007 peak of about 12.2 million, with modest growth since the late 2010s [1][2].

What that means and why estimates vary
- “Unauthorized” typically includes people who entered without inspection and people who overstayed a visa; it is a stock (how many live here now), not a count of annual border encounters or entries.
- No registry exists, so demographers infer the total by comparing survey counts of the foreign-born population to administrative records and modeling undercounts (the “residual” method). Different datasets, time lags, and undercount assumptions produce slightly different numbers, hence a narrow range rather than a single point estimate [1][2][4].
- Credible, mainstream demographers broadly converge around roughly 10–11 million. Some advocacy groups publish substantially higher figures (16–20+ million), but those estimates rest on different assumptions about survey undercounts and have been widely critiqued by population researchers [4][5][6].

Trends to know
- Peak and decline: The unauthorized population peaked around 12.2 million in 2007, fell during and after the Great Recession, and remained lower throughout the 2010s [1].
- Recent years: Estimates show stabilization or a modest uptick by 2021–2022 (about 10.5–10.6 million) but still below the 2007 peak [1][2]. Because official stock estimates lag by a year or more, the precise 2023–2024 total is not yet settled in the major datasets; demographers expect the number to be somewhat higher than in 2021, but not dramatically above the low- to mid-11 million range absent strong evidence to the contrary [1][2][3].

Bottom line: A reasonable, evidence-based statement is that about 11 million people are living in the U.S. without lawful immigration status, with most rigorous estimates landing between 10.5 and 11 million in 2021–2022 and suggesting modest growth since then [1][2][3].
