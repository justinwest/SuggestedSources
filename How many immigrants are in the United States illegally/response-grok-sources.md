Estimating the number of immigrants living in the United States illegally (often referred to as undocumented or unauthorized immigrants) is challenging due to the clandestine nature of the population, differences in methodologies, and ongoing debates over data sources. Official and academic estimates typically range from about 11 million to over 22 million, depending on the source and time frame. These figures represent the "stock" of undocumented individuals residing in the U.S., not the "flow" of new arrivals or border encounters. Below, I'll break down the key estimates from reliable sources, including variations and recent trends, while noting that no single figure is definitive due to undercounting and methodological differences.

### Conventional Estimates
The most widely cited estimates come from government agencies and nonpartisan research organizations, which generally place the undocumented population at around 11-12 million as of recent years. For instance:
- The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimated there were approximately 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. as of January 2018, with the population remaining relatively stable since 2012 [5].
- Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan think tank, reported about 11.0 million unauthorized immigrants in 2022, up slightly from 10.5 million in 2021. This represents about 3% of the total U.S. population and 22% of the foreign-born population. Pew's methodology relies on "residual" estimation, subtracting legal immigrants from total foreign-born counts in census data [6].
- These figures align with analyses from FactCheck.org, which notes that the undocumented population has hovered around 11 million for over a decade, though it acknowledges potential undercounts and recent increases due to border surges [2].

These conventional estimates are based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey and adjustments for underreporting. They suggest the population peaked at 12.2 million in 2007, declined during the Great Recession, and has since stabilized or grown modestly [6].

### Higher Estimates and Critiques
Some studies challenge these numbers, arguing that traditional methods undercount the population. A notable example is a 2018 study from MIT Sloan School of Management and Yale researchers, which used mathematical modeling incorporating deportation rates, border apprehensions, visa overstays, and voluntary emigration. It estimated the undocumented population at 22.1 million as of 2016—roughly double the conventional estimate of 11.3 million at the time [1]. The study suggested that undercounting occurs because official surveys miss hidden populations, and it projected the number could be even higher if trends continued.

This higher estimate has been influential but controversial. Critics, including Pew researchers, argue it relies on assumptions that may overestimate inflows and underestimate outflows (e.g., returns to home countries) [6]. FactCheck.org also references this debate, noting that while the MIT study highlights potential flaws in official counts, it hasn't been widely adopted as the standard [2].

### Impact of Recent Immigration Trends
Recent border encounters have led to speculation about growth in the undocumented population. Since Fiscal Year 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has reported over 10.8 million migrant encounters at the southwest border, including 8.2 million under the Biden administration through FY2024 [3]. However, these are not direct additions to the undocumented population:
- Many encounters result in expulsions, releases, or asylum claims rather than permanent residency.
- A BBC analysis estimates that about 2.5 million people may have entered and stayed illegally since 2021, potentially increasing the total undocumented population [4].
- FactCheck.org clarifies that of the roughly 8 million encounters under Biden (through early 2024), about 3.3 million were expelled, 2.5 million were released into the U.S. pending proceedings, and others were processed differently. This could add 1-2 million net to the undocumented count, but precise figures are elusive due to unknowns like "got-aways" (estimated at 1.8 million since FY2021) [2][3].

Adjusting for these trends, some updated projections suggest the current undocumented population could be 12-13 million or higher. For example, the Migration Policy Institute estimates around 11.3 million as of 2022 but notes potential growth from recent asylum seekers and visa overstays [7].

### Factors Influencing Estimates
- **Methodological Differences**: Official counts use census data and residuals, while alternative models like MIT's incorporate broader variables. Visa overstays account for about 40-50% of the undocumented population, per DHS [5].
- **Demographics**: About 75% of undocumented immigrants are from Mexico and Central America, with growing numbers from South America and Asia [6].
- **Policy Impacts**: Policies like Title 42 (used for rapid expulsions during the COVID-19 pandemic) and asylum backlogs affect how many stay [2][4].
- **Uncertainty**: All estimates have margins of error; Pew's is ±400,000 for recent years [6]. The actual number could be higher due to uncounted "got-aways" or lower if outflows (e.g., deportations, which totaled 1.5 million since FY2021 [3]) are underestimated.

In summary, the most commonly accepted estimate is around 11-12 million, but higher figures like 22 million from the MIT study highlight ongoing debates. Recent border activity suggests modest growth, potentially pushing the total to 13 million or more by 2024. For the latest data, consulting DHS or Pew is recommended, as numbers can change with new reports.
