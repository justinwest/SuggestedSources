### Response: How Many Immigrants Are in the United States Illegally?

Estimating the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States is a complex task due to the inherent challenges of counting a population that often avoids detection. However, research and studies provide valuable insights into the approximate size of this population. According to a study highlighted by MIT Sloan School of Management, the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. may be significantly higher than commonly cited estimates. The study, conducted by researchers from MIT and Yale, suggests that the undocumented immigrant population could be roughly double the current widely accepted estimate of 11.3 million. This would place the number closer to 22.1 million as of 2016 [1].

The discrepancy in estimates arises from differing methodologies. Traditional estimates, often cited by government agencies and organizations like the Pew Research Center, rely on survey data and residual methods (subtracting the number of legal immigrants from total foreign-born population counts). In contrast, the MIT-Yale study uses a new approach based on operational data, such as border apprehensions and visa overstays, combined with demographic modeling to arrive at a higher figure [1]. While this higher estimate has sparked debate, it underscores the uncertainty and variability in quantifying the undocumented population.

It is important to note that the exact number remains uncertain due to the clandestine nature of undocumented immigration, and estimates can vary depending on the data sources and methodologies used. The MIT-Yale study's findings suggest that policymakers and researchers may need to reconsider the scale of undocumented immigration when addressing related social, economic, and political issues [1].
