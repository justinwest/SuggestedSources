Estimating the number of immigrants in the United States without legal authorization is a complex task, as there is no official government census of this population. Instead, government agencies, think tanks, and academic institutions produce estimates based on demographic and statistical analysis. Consequently, different sources provide slightly different numbers, but they generally fall within a specific range.

The most widely cited estimates for the unauthorized immigrant population in recent years place the figure between **10.3 million and 11 million**. However, these figures are typically based on data from 2021 or 2022. More recent analyses suggest a significant increase in this population since then due to a rise in net immigration.

### Key Estimates from Major Sources

1.  **Pew Research Center:** A leading source for this data, the Pew Research Center estimated that there were **10.5 million** unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in 2021. This number was largely unchanged from 2019 and represented a decline from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007. The population had remained relatively stable for over a decade prior to recent increases in border arrivals [1].

2.  **U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS):** The most recent official government estimate comes from the DHS, which reported that **11.0 million** unauthorized immigrants were living in the U.S. as of January 1, 2022. This figure marked a slight increase from the 10.5 million estimated in 2020 [2].

3.  **Center for Migration Studies (CMS):** CMS, a non-partisan think tank, estimated the unauthorized population to be **10.38 million** at the end of 2022. Their analysis noted that while arrivals have increased, the total population number has been moderated by other factors, such as departures, deaths, and adjustments of legal status [3].

### The Challenge of Counting and Recent Trends

These estimates are generally calculated using the "residual method." Researchers take the total number of foreign-born individuals living in the U.S. from surveys like the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) and subtract the number of legally resident foreign-born individuals. The remaining "residual" number is the estimated unauthorized population. This method has limitations, including potential undercounts in surveys and reliance on demographic assumptions.

Since the data for the estimates above were collected (mostly in 2021 and 2022), there has been a significant increase in migrant encounters at the U.S. southern border. This has led many analysts to conclude that the total unauthorized population has grown.

*   The **Congressional Budget Office (CBO)**, in a 2024 report, estimated that net immigration to the U.S. by people in the "other foreign national" category (a group that includes unauthorized immigrants) was 2.4 million in 2023, following 1.7 million in 2022. This data strongly suggests a substantial increase in the resident unauthorized population since the last comprehensive estimates were made [4].
*   The **Center for Immigration Studies (CIS)**, an organization that advocates for lower immigration, produced a higher and more recent estimate. They calculated that the unauthorized immigrant population reached **13.7 million** in January 2024, attributing the rapid growth directly to the increase in border encounters since 2021 [5].

### A Note on Terminology

The terminology used to describe this population is often a subject of debate.
*   **Unauthorized immigrant** and **undocumented immigrant** are terms commonly used by researchers, academic institutions, and many news organizations to describe individuals who entered the country without inspection or overstayed a valid visa.
*   **Illegal immigrant** is a term used by some government agencies and news outlets, but it is considered pejorative by many immigrant advocacy groups and has become less common in academic and journalistic writing.

In summary, while the most established, peer-reviewed estimates place the unauthorized immigrant population at around 10.5 to 11 million based on 2021-2022 data, more recent analysis accounting for the surge in migration since then suggests the current number is likely significantly higher, possibly in the range of 12 to 14 million.

2.  U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Immigration Statistics. This is the U.S. government's official estimate. The report places the unauthorized population at 11.0 million as of January 2022. It uses a standard residual methodology based on Census Bureau data and is considered a baseline figure by many researchers.

3.  Warren, Robert. Center for Migration Studies (CMS). This report estimates a lower figure of 10.38 million for the end of 2022. The author argues that while new arrivals are high, estimates often do not fully account for emigrations, deportations, and status adjustments, which offset the total population growth.

4.  Congressional Budget Office (CBO). This report focuses on the economic and budgetary outlook, but includes projections on net immigration. The CBO expresses the view that net immigration of "other foreign nationals" (a proxy for the unauthorized population and those with temporary statuses) increased dramatically in 2022 and 2023, which implies significant growth in the total unauthorized population since the last formal estimates were produced.

5.  Zeigler, Karen and Steven A. Camarota. Center for Immigration Studies (CIS). This organization advocates for lower levels of immigration. Their report presents a significantly higher estimate of 13.7 million as of January 2024. The authors' view is that the post-2021 increase in border crossings has directly translated into a rapid and substantial expansion of the unauthorized immigrant population, a viewpoint that leads to one of the highest available estimates.
