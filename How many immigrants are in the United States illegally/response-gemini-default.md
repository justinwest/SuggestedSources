Of course. Here is a comprehensive, accurate, and well-structured response to your question.

### How Many Immigrants Are in the United States Illegally?

The exact number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States is unknown because this population is, by its nature, difficult to count. However, government agencies and independent research organizations produce reliable estimates using sophisticated demographic and statistical methods.

The most widely cited estimates place the number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. at **between 10.3 million and 11 million**.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the data, methodology, and key demographic trends.

### 1. Key Estimates from Major Sources

Several organizations are considered authoritative sources for this data. Their estimates generally align, providing a consistent picture of the unauthorized population.

*   **Pew Research Center:** As of 2021, the Pew Research Center estimated there were **10.5 million** unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. This number represented a slight increase from 2019 but was significantly lower than the peak of 12.2 million in 2007.
*   **Department of Homeland Security (DHS):** The most recent DHS report estimated there were **11.0 million** unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. as of January 2022. The DHS data often has a time lag but is considered a benchmark for government analysis.
*   **Center for Migration Studies (CMS):** CMS, a non-partisan think tank, estimated a slightly lower figure of **10.39 million** unauthorized residents in 2021. Their research highlights that the population has been decreasing from Mexico while increasing from other regions.

**Why is it an estimate? The "Residual Method"**
It is impossible to conduct a direct count of unauthorized immigrants. Instead, researchers use a well-established methodology called the **residual method**:
1.  **Start with the total foreign-born population:** They use data from large-scale surveys like the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS).
2.  **Subtract the legally-resident foreign-born population:** They use official government records to determine the number of naturalized citizens, lawful permanent residents (green card holders), and individuals on temporary legal visas (like students and temporary workers).
3.  **The remainder is the estimate:** The number left over—the "residual"—is the estimated unauthorized immigrant population. This method is the gold standard but has a margin of error due to survey sampling and potential undercounts.

### 2. Recent Trends and Changes

The size and composition of the unauthorized immigrant population are not static. Key trends include:

*   **Historical Peak and Decline:** The population peaked at **12.2 million in 2007** and then entered a decade-long decline and plateau, driven by the Great Recession and increased enforcement.
*   **Shift in Mode of Arrival:** A common misconception is that most unauthorized immigrants cross the border without authorization. In the last decade, a significant portion—and in some years, a majority—of new arrivals are **visa overstays**. These are individuals who entered the U.S. legally on a temporary visa (e.g., for tourism, business, or study) but remained after their visa expired.
*   **Recent Border Encounters (Post-2021):** Since 2021, there has been a significant increase in migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border. While these high numbers have put a strain on resources, it is important to note that "encounters" do not translate one-to-one into a permanent increase in the unauthorized population. Many individuals are expelled, some are granted temporary legal status (like parole) to pursue asylum claims, and others make multiple attempts to cross. Nonetheless, most experts agree that the total unauthorized population has likely risen since the 2021/2022 estimates were finalized.

### 3. Demographic Profile of the Unauthorized Population

Understanding *who* makes up this population provides critical context beyond a single number.

**A. Country of Origin**
There has been a dramatic shift in the countries of origin over the past 15 years.
*   **Mexico:** While still the largest single country of origin, the number of unauthorized immigrants from Mexico has fallen sharply, from a peak of 6.9 million in 2007 to approximately **4.1 million in 2021** (Pew Research).
*   **Central America:** There has been significant growth from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras (the "Northern Triangle" countries).
*   **Other Regions:** There has also been substantial growth from other parts of the world, including South America (notably Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador) and Asia (India and China).

**B. Length of Residence in the U.S.**
The unauthorized immigrant population is increasingly long-term and settled.
*   The median length of residence is over **15 years**.
*   Approximately two-thirds of unauthorized adult immigrants have lived in the U.S. for **10 years or more**.
*   Only a small fraction are recent arrivals; the image of a constantly arriving, transient population is not supported by the data.

**C. Geographic Distribution**
The population is concentrated in a handful of states, though it is present in all 50. The top states by population are:
1.  **California**
2.  **Texas**
3.  **Florida**
4.  **New York**
5.  **New Jersey**
6.  **Illinois**

**D. Labor Force Participation**
Unauthorized immigrants have a very high rate of labor force participation. They make up approximately **4.4% of the U.S. workforce** and are overrepresented in certain industries, such as agriculture, construction, and hospitality.

### Summary and Key Takeaways

*   **The Best Estimate:** The number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. is estimated to be around **10.5 million**, with a general range of 10.3 to 11 million.
*   **It's an Estimate, Not a Headcount:** The number is derived from a statistical method, not a direct count.
*   **Population is Increasingly Settled:** The majority are long-term residents who have been in the U.S. for over a decade.
*   **Shifting Origins:** The population from Mexico has declined, while the numbers from Central America, South America, and Asia have grown.
*   **Visa Overstays are a Major Factor:** A significant portion of the unauthorized population entered the U.S. legally and overstayed their visas, not by crossing the border without inspection.
*   **Recent Trends Suggest an Increase:** While the most recent finalized data is from 2021/2022, high levels of border encounters since then suggest the total population has likely increased, though the final number is not yet known.

This data provides a factual foundation for understanding a complex and often politicized issue.
