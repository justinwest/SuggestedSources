Determining the exact number of immigrants in the United States without legal authorization is a complex task, as this population is not officially tracked. However, government agencies and non-partisan research organizations produce regular, reliable estimates using sophisticated statistical methods.

The most widely accepted estimates place the number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. at between **10.5 million and 11 million**.

It is important to note that researchers and government bodies typically use terms like "unauthorized," "undocumented," or "without legal status" rather than "illegal" to describe the population's civil immigration status, as opposed to a criminal one.

### Key Estimates from Major Sources

Different organizations produce slightly different estimates based on the data sets and time periods they analyze, but their findings are largely consistent.

1.  **Pew Research Center:** The Pew Research Center, a leading non-partisan think tank, estimated that there were **10.5 million** unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in 2021. This was the first increase in this population since its peak in 2007 [1].

2.  **U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS):** The most recent official government estimate comes from the DHS Office of Immigration Statistics. It estimated that **11.0 million** unauthorized immigrants were living in the United. States as of January 1, 2022. This figure represents an increase from their 2021 estimate of 10.5 million [2].

3.  **Center for Migration Studies (CMS):** CMS, a non-partisan research institute, estimated the undocumented population to be **10.37 million** in 2021. Their analysis also highlights that a significant majority of this population has resided in the U.S. for many years [3].

### Understanding the Methodology

These are not simple headcounts. The numbers are estimates derived primarily through a **residual method**. The process generally works as follows:

*   **Start with a Total:** Researchers begin with the total number of foreign-born individuals living in the U.S., which is determined through large-scale demographic surveys like the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS).
*   **Subtract the Legal Population:** They then subtract the number of foreign-born residents who are known to be living in the country legally. This number is calculated using administrative records from government agencies like DHS and the State Department, and includes lawful permanent residents (green card holders), naturalized citizens, and individuals on various long-term temporary visas (like H-1B or F-1 visas).
*   **The Remainder is the Estimate:** The remaining population—the "residual"—is the estimated unauthorized immigrant population. Researchers then make statistical adjustments to account for potential survey undercounts and other variables.

### Recent Trends and Demographics

The data reveals several important trends about this population:

*   **Overall Population Trend:** The unauthorized immigrant population peaked at 12.2 million in 2007 and then steadily declined for more than a decade. The recent estimates for 2021 and 2022 mark the first significant increase since that peak [1, 2].
*   **Mode of Arrival:** A common misconception is that all unauthorized immigrants cross the border without inspection. However, a significant portion arrived legally on temporary visas and then remained in the country after their visa expired. DHS estimates that "nonimmigrant overstays" have accounted for over 40% of the growth in the unauthorized population in recent years [4].
*   **Country of Origin:** While immigrants from Mexico still make up the largest single group, their numbers have declined significantly since 2007. The population has become more diverse, with growth in the number of unauthorized immigrants from Central America (notably El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras), Asia, and other regions [1].
*   **Length of Residence:** The unauthorized immigrant population is increasingly long-settled. In 2021, the median length of residence in the U.S. for an unauthorized immigrant adult was 15.9 years, meaning a majority arrived before 2006. Nearly two-thirds of unauthorized immigrants have lived in the U.S. for 10 years or more [1].

Passel and Jens Manuel Krogstad, focus on trends over time, demographic characteristics (country of origin, years in the U.S.), and the methodology used for the estimate. It highlights the first population increase after years of decline.

4.  **Department of Homeland Security (DHS):** This separate DHS report focuses specifically on visa overstays. It provides data showing that nonimmigrant overstays are a primary contributor to the growth in the unauthorized immigrant population, challenging the narrative that illegal immigration is driven solely by unlawful border crossings.
