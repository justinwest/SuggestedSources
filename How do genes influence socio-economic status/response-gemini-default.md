Genes do not directly determine socioeconomic status (SES), which is a complex social outcome influenced by education, income, and occupation. Instead, modern research suggests that genetics has a small and indirect influence on SES, primarily by affecting psychological and behavioral traits that are themselves correlated with educational and occupational success. This influence is heavily mediated and moderated by the environment, making it impossible to separate "nature" from "nurture" [1, 2].

The relationship between genes and SES can be understood through several key mechanisms:

### 1. Indirect Influence via Heritable Traits

The primary way genes connect to SES is indirectly, through their influence on traits that have been shown to be partially heritable. These genes do not code for "income" or "poverty," but for predispositions that can make navigating educational and economic systems easier or harder for an individual [2].

*   **Cognitive Abilities:** General cognitive ability (often measured as IQ) is one of the strongest individual-level predictors of academic and job performance. Decades of twin and family studies have shown that a significant portion of the variation in cognitive ability within a population is attributable to genetic differences [3]. Therefore, genetic predispositions that contribute to higher cognitive ability can, in turn, increase the probability of achieving higher levels of education and entering more complex, higher-paying occupations.
*   **Non-Cognitive Skills & Personality:** Traits like conscientiousness, grit, openness to experience, self-control, and risk tolerance also influence life outcomes. For instance, high conscientiousness is linked to better academic performance and job stability. These personality traits are also partially heritable. Genetic variants associated with these traits can thus provide a small advantage or disadvantage in socioeconomic attainment [1, 4].

### 2. Polygenic Scores and Their Predictive Power

Modern genetic research uses a tool called a **polygenic score (PGS)**. A PGS aggregates the effects of thousands or even millions of tiny genetic variations across a person's genome to estimate their genetic predisposition for a particular trait. Researchers have developed PGS for outcomes like "educational attainment" (EA) [1].

It is crucial to understand that a PGS for educational attainment is a probabilistic tool, not a deterministic one. In European-ancestry populations (where most research has been conducted), the current PGS for EA explains approximately 12-16% of the variance in actual years of schooling [1, 2]. This means that while it has some predictive power—more than any single social factor like family income alone—over 80% of the differences in educational attainment are explained by other factors, including environment, chance, and their interactions with genes.

### 3. Gene-Environment Interaction (GxE)

Gene-environment interaction occurs when the effect of a genetic predisposition is dependent on the environment. This is a critical concept for understanding SES. Genetic potential may not be realized in a restrictive or deprived environment.

A landmark study found that the heritability of IQ was substantially higher for children in high-SES families compared to those in low-SES families [5]. In other words, in affluent environments with access to good nutrition, schools, and cognitive stimulation, genetic differences between children were more fully expressed. In impoverished environments, adverse conditions suppressed the expression of genetic potential, making the environment the dominant factor in explaining differences in IQ. This suggests that policies that improve the environment for disadvantaged children can help them better realize their innate potential and reduce outcome inequality [4, 5].

### 4. Gene-Environment Correlation (rGE)

Gene-environment correlation describes how an individual's genetic predispositions can be correlated with the environments they experience. This happens in three main ways that entangle nature and nurture:

*   **Passive rGE:** Parents provide their children with both genes and an environment. For example, parents with genetic predispositions for high cognitive ability are more likely to achieve high SES and provide a resource-rich home environment (e.g., books, educational toys, stimulating conversation). Their children inherit both the genetic predispositions and the enriched environment, making it difficult to disentangle the two effects [6].
*   **Evocative rGE:** An individual's genetically influenced traits evoke certain responses from the environment. A child with a natural predisposition for curiosity and learning may receive more attention and encouragement from teachers, further enhancing their educational development.
*   **Active rGE (Niche-Picking):** Individuals actively select, modify, and create environments that are compatible with their genetic predispositions. A person with a genetic predisposition for conscientiousness and academic interests is more likely to choose to spend time in the library and associate with studious peers, thereby creating an environment that reinforces their path to educational success [2].

### 5. Social Mobility and Genetic Stratification

Some researchers argue that in a society with high social mobility (a "meritocracy"), an individual's SES will become more aligned with their heritable traits over time. This is sometimes called the "social selection" hypothesis [3]. Under this model, children with genetic predispositions favorable for education who are born into low-SES families may be more likely to experience upward social mobility. Conversely, children born into high-SES families who lack these genetic predispositions may be more likely to experience downward mobility. This process can lead to a society where social class becomes partially correlated with genetic predispositions over generations [3, 6].

### Limitations and Ethical Considerations

It is essential to approach this topic with extreme caution due to its scientific complexity and history of misuse in eugenics and scientific racism.

*   **Small Effect Sizes:** The predictive power of genes for SES is small. Environmental factors, social structures, and policy remain far more powerful drivers of socioeconomic outcomes [4].
*   **Correlation, Not Causation:** A correlation between a PGS and SES does not prove that genes *cause* the outcome. Both could be influenced by a third factor, such as social stratification, where systemic discrimination creates correlations between ancestry (which is what genetic markers measure) and social outcomes [6].
*   **Ancestry Bias:** The vast majority of genetic studies have been conducted on people of European ancestry. The PGS developed from this research are not accurate and are potentially biased when applied to individuals from other ancestral backgrounds. This is a major scientific and ethical failing that limits the generalizability of current findings [1, 6].

In conclusion, genes are not destiny. They influence socioeconomic status through small, probabilistic, and indirect pathways, primarily by affecting psychological traits that are valuable for educational and occupational success. This genetic influence is deeply intertwined with and often dependent on the environment, making it impossible to consider "nature" in isolation from "nurture."

    *   **Authors' View:** Belsky and Harden argue that genomics, particularly polygenic scores, can be a useful tool for the social sciences to understand the mechanisms linking genes to life outcomes like educational attainment and income. They emphasize that these scores are probabilistic, not deterministic, and explain a small fraction of variance, but can help illuminate gene-environment interplay and inform social policy by identifying who might benefit most from certain interventions.

    *   **Authors' View:** Mills and Barban advocate for a new field of "sociogenomics" that integrates genetic data into sociological research. They stress that this must be done cautiously, rejecting genetic determinism. They focus on how genes operate indirectly through other traits and are deeply entangled with the social environment through gene-environment correlations and interactions, arguing that sociologists are well-placed to study these complex dynamics.

    *   **Authors' View:** Plomin and von Stumm, leading behavioral geneticists, summarize the evidence for the substantial heritability of intelligence. They argue that as societies become more meritocratic, genetic differences will play an increasingly important role in explaining variation in social status and mobility (the "social selection" hypothesis). They highlight the promise of polygenic scores to move beyond heritability estimates to specific genetic predictors.

    *   **Author's View:** Harden argues that acknowledging the role of "genetic luck" is essential for building a more just and equal society. She forcefully rejects genetic determinism and eugenics, instead arguing that understanding how genes contribute to inequality (e.g., via education) can help us design better policies that support all individuals, regardless of their genetic predispositions, and correct for unearned advantages.

    *   **Authors' View:** This is the seminal paper demonstrating a gene-environment interaction for IQ. The authors show that the proportion of variance in IQ attributable to genes is much larger in high-SES environments than in low-SES environments. Their view is that genetic potential for intelligence can be suppressed by the adverse conditions associated with poverty, highlighting the powerful role the environment plays in moderating genetic effects.

    *   **Authors' View:** The authors provide a critical analysis of polygenic scores for educational attainment, arguing that their predictive power is likely inflated by confounding factors. They demonstrate that much of the correlation between a PGS and SES is driven by deep-seated social stratification (how people sort into neighborhoods and social groups), passive gene-environment correlations (inheritance of both genes and environments), and assortative mating (people partnering with those similar to them). They urge extreme caution in interpreting PGS as a purely biological or causal measure.
