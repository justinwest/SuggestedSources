# How do genes influence socio-economic status?

How genes influence socio-economic status (SES)

1. Genes do not encode “wealth” or “occupation” directly. Instead, they influence a set of intermediate traits—cognitive ability, personality, health, physical attractiveness, height, persistence, risk-taking, etc.—that labour markets and educational systems reward. Individuals who inherit more of the alleles that favour these traits tend, on average, to attain more education, higher income and higher occupational prestige [2].

2. Gene–environment correlation amplifies these effects. Parents pass on both their genes and the environments they can afford to create (“genetic nurture”). Children whose parents have genotypes associated with higher education, for example, grow up in homes that emphasise schooling and have more material resources, further boosting the child’s chances of economic success above and beyond the genes they themselves inherited [2]. 

3. Assortative mating and social homogamy lock the process in. High-status people tend to partner with each other, concentrating both economic resources and advantageous alleles in the same families. Over generations this leads to measurable differences in average polygenic scores between social strata and to a surprisingly slow rate of social mobility [1] [3].

4. Historical evidence complements genomic studies. By tracing rare surnames across centuries and countries, Gregory Clark finds that underlying “status competence” correlates about 0.7–0.8 between parents and children—much higher than conventional estimates. He argues that this persistence is most plausibly explained by a largely genetic component to the traits that generate status, rather than by durable institutional privilege alone [3].

5. Although SES is a social construct, it acquires heritability. Twin, adoption and molecular genetic studies commonly report that ≈30–50 % of the variation in income, education or neighbourhood quality can be attributed to genes, because societies systematically reward the traits those genes influence. Over time SES then feeds back on the gene pool through selective migration, differential fertility and mortality, creating small but detectable shifts in allele frequencies between richer and poorer groups [2].

6. Effect sizes remain modest and probabilistic. Polygenic scores built from millions of DNA variants typically explain less than 15 % of the variance in educational attainment or income and predict only slight differences in average earnings between individuals at the extremes. Environment, policy and sheer luck still account for the majority of the inequality we observe [1] [2].

7. Therefore, genes influence SES indirectly, partly and contingently on social institutions. Genetic endowments supply the raw material, while markets, schools, laws and cultural values determine which traits are rewarded and how strongly. Change the rules of the game—through universal schooling, progressive taxation, anti-discrimination law—and the weight of genetic differences on economic outcomes can rise or fall.

Rutherford reviews recent behavioural-genetic work. He stresses that polygenic predictions are modest, that SES–gene correlations partly reflect environmental transmission and that genetic explanations must be paired with social analysis.

Authors argue SES is socially defined yet partially heritable (≈30–50 %). They describe mechanisms—direct genetic effects, genetic nurture, assortative mating, selection—and show that SES itself can shape the genetic landscape of populations.

Gregory Clark’s surname studies reveal very slow social mobility and attribute it to a highly heritable, probably genetic, “general status factor,” implying a stronger genetic influence on SES than conventional models assume.
