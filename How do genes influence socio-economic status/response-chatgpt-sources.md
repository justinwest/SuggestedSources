# How do genes influence socio-economic status?

Genes influence socio-economic status (SES) in several, partly overlapping, ways.  None of them make SES “genetically fixed”, but they do mean that genetic variation is one of the upstream factors that help to sort people into different educational, occupational and income levels.

1. Heritability of SES is modest but non-zero  
   • Twin and molecular studies typically find that 10–20 % of the variance in broad SES indices (education, income, occupational class or an index that combines them) can be traced to common genetic variants measured in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [2], [4], [5].  
   • These shares are similar across rich countries and across birth cohorts once environmental changes are taken into account [1].

2. What the genes are actually doing: mediation through human-capital traits  
   • The individual variants discovered so far do not code for “money genes”. They influence intermediate traits such as cognitive ability, executive function, personality (e.g. conscientiousness, openness, risk-tolerance) and physical and mental health.  Those intermediate traits, in turn, predict years of schooling, productivity and earnings [2].  
   • Polygenic indices (PGIs) for educational attainment already explain 12–15 % of the variance in years of education and about 7–10 % of the variance in income; once education is added to the regression, most of the direct effect of the PGI on earnings disappears, showing that education is a main pathway [4], [6].

3. Indirect genetic effects (“genetic nurture”)  
   • Parents’ genes shape the rearing environment they create – how much they read to a child, the quality of neighbourhoods they can afford, the stability of family life, etc.  Adoption and trio-genotype studies show that about one-third of the association between a child’s education-PGI and her own SES reflects such indirect effects rather than the alleles she inherited [1], [2].

4. Gene–environment correlation and social sorting  
   • People whose genotypes predispose them to higher education tend to move to prosperous regions, marry similarly educated partners, and pass on both genes and advantaged environments to their children.  This creates geographic and social clustering of “high-SES” alleles and increases the observed genetic variance of SES in the population [1], [2].  
   • Migration and assortative mating therefore amplify the genetic component of SES even if the underlying direct effects of the alleles are small.

5. Persistence across generations  
   • Historical surname studies find that occupational and educational rank is correlated over ~0.70 per generation once measurement error is removed [3].  The most parsimonious explanation, Gregory Clark argues, is the transmission of abilities that are at least partly genetic, because differential access to schooling or wealth explains too little of the observed persistence.

6. Interaction with policy and institutions  
   • The heritability of SES is not fixed.  When an educational reform eliminates tuition fees or when primary care improves, the environmental variance shrinks and the share of trait variance that is “explained” by genes can rise or fall.  Genetic influence is contingent on the opportunity structure that societies create [1], [2].

7. Limits of genetic prediction and ethical caveats  
   • Current PGIs leave at least 80 % of the variance in SES unexplained; environmental shocks, discrimination, macro-economic cycles and pure luck still dominate individual destinies.  
   • Associations are population-specific and do not license claims about innate superiority of groups; using genetic information for hiring or schooling decisions would be both scientifically weak and ethically dubious [2].

In short, genes influence SES indirectly by shaping traits that labour markets and schools reward, and by biasing the environments people select into.  Because those effects accumulate across generations through assortative mating and the transmission of family resources, they help to explain why socio-economic advantage is moderately—but far from perfectly—heritable.
