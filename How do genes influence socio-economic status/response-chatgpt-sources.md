# How do genes influence socio-economic status?

Genes contribute to socio-economic status (SES) primarily by influencing traits that help individuals succeed in education and work. For example, cognitive ability and certain personality characteristics (like persistence or social skills) are partially heritable and well-known predictors of educational and economic success ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=behaviours%2C%20educational%20attainment%20,18%7D.%20These%20factors%20are)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=phenome,influences%20on%20income%20and%20health)). In other words, people with genetic predispositions that enhance skills or health may have an edge in school and the labor market. Twin studies in various Western countries have accordingly found that about 40–50% of the variation in individuals’ income or earnings can be statistically attributed to genetic differences ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=cognitive%20ability%20and%20personality%20traits,21)) ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10888-019-09413-x#:~:text=Using%20twenty%20years%20of%20earnings,the%20measure%20of%20genetic%20relatedness)). By contrast, the influence of the family environment shared by siblings (such as parental income or upbringing) tends to be smaller – in one Finnish twin study it was effectively near zero for lifetime earnings ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10888-019-09413-x#:~:text=Using%20twenty%20years%20of%20earnings,the%20measure%20of%20genetic%20relatedness)). This doesn’t mean genes *determine* one’s finances – rather, thousands of genetic variants each contribute a tiny amount, often through complex pathways. As one genome-wide analysis put it, there is no single “wealth gene,” but many common genetic variants have small additive effects on income, usually by affecting education or health ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=We%20conducted%20a%20genome,92)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=with%20small%20effect%20sizes%20,These%20findings%20highlight%20the)). Indeed, a recent study of ~668,000 people identified 162 DNA loci associated with income; combined into a polygenic score, these genetic cues explained at most around 1–5% of the variance in individual incomes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=We%20conducted%20a%20genome,92)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=with%20small%20effect%20sizes%20,influences%20on%20income%20and%20health)). This underscores that genetics influence SES in probabilistic ways alongside many non-genetic factors. 

**Genetic influences operate indirectly**. Key pathways include educational attainment, cognitive skills, physical and mental health, and personality traits – all factors that help shape one’s socio-economic outcomes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=environmental%20conditions%20and%20education,reflect%20social%20realities%20shaped%20by)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=phenome,influences%20on%20income%20and%20health)). For instance, genes that affect brain development or dopamine signaling might influence how easily someone learns at school, which in turn affects their highest degree and job prospects. Other genes might impact traits like impulsivity or grit, thereby influencing career stability or financial decisions. Over many genetic variants, these subtle effects can tilt the odds of higher vs. lower SES. Empirical data bear this out: individuals with higher “education polygenic scores” (indicating a genetic propensity to do well in school) tend to complete more years of schooling and land in higher-paying occupations than those with lower scores ([www.factsandarts.com](https://www.factsandarts.com/essays/inequality-now-extends-peoples-dna?page=40#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20polygenic%20scores%20for,fifth%20had%20such%20a%20degree)) ([www.factsandarts.com](https://www.factsandarts.com/essays/inequality-now-extends-peoples-dna?page=40#:~:text=Not%20just%20education)). In one longitudinal analysis, people scoring in the top 10% of a genetic index for education were several times more likely to earn a university degree than those in the bottom 10% ([www.factsandarts.com](https://www.factsandarts.com/essays/inequality-now-extends-peoples-dna?page=40#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20polygenic%20scores%20for,fifth%20had%20such%20a%20degree)) ([www.factsandarts.com](https://www.factsandarts.com/essays/inequality-now-extends-peoples-dna?page=40#:~:text=In%20itself%2C%20this%20is%20not,poorer%20areas%20for%20richer%20ones)). These genetic effects on education then translate into differences in income and social status. Furthermore, some of the same genetic predispositions may also promote better health and longevity (for example, via higher intelligence leading to healthier behaviors), which can reinforce socio-economic advantages ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=phenome,influences%20on%20income%20and%20health)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=and%20back%20pain,influences%20on%20income%20and%20health)). This genetic overlap helps explain why wealthier or more educated individuals often have better health – part of that correlation arises because certain genes simultaneously favor both higher education *and* robust health ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=phenome,influences%20on%20income%20and%20health)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=and%20back%20pain,influences%20on%20income%20and%20health)). (At the same time, researchers have found that after accounting for education-linked genes, any remaining genetic advantages for income might come with trade-offs – in one study, the residual genetic factor for higher income was linked to better mental health but also *higher* risks of physical issues and risk-taking behaviors like smoking ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=phenome,influences%20on%20income%20and%20health)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=and%20back%20pain,influences%20on%20income%20and%20health)), suggesting multiple biological pathways to SES with some counterbalancing effects.)

**Intergenerational transmission and heritability:** Because children inherit genes from their parents, genetic influences are one reason that socio-economic status tends to cluster in families. A child whose parents are highly educated or affluent is more likely to have genes that promote those outcomes as well. Economic historian Gregory Clark famously argued that “inequality starts at conception” – his analysis of family lineages found social status to be as strongly *inherited* as height or eye color ([techratchet.com](https://techratchet.com/2020/03/05/book-summary-the-son-also-rises-surnames-and-the-history-of-social-mobility-by-gregory-clarke/#:~:text=,personal%20choice%20and%20just%20plain)) ([techratchet.com](https://techratchet.com/2020/03/05/book-summary-the-son-also-rises-surnames-and-the-history-of-social-mobility-by-gregory-clarke/#:~:text=Most%20studies%20on%20social%20mobility,look%20at%20a%20single%20generation)). Using centuries of surname data, Clark observed an intergenerational correlation in status on the order of 0.7–0.8 (1.0 would be perfect inheritance) across many societies ([techratchet.com](https://techratchet.com/2020/03/05/book-summary-the-son-also-rises-surnames-and-the-history-of-social-mobility-by-gregory-clarke/#:~:text=,personal%20choice%20and%20just%20plain)) ([techratchet.com](https://techratchet.com/2020/03/05/book-summary-the-son-also-rises-surnames-and-the-history-of-social-mobility-by-gregory-clarke/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CFamilies%20turn%20out%20to%20have,%E2%80%9D)). In plain terms, he suggests that perhaps 50–70% of the differences in status between people are already **predictable at birth** due to the inherited endowments of talent or other advantages ([techratchet.com](https://techratchet.com/2020/03/05/book-summary-the-son-also-rises-surnames-and-the-history-of-social-mobility-by-gregory-clarke/#:~:text=)). Adoption studies provide supporting evidence: adoptees tend to resemble their biological parents more than their adoptive parents in outcomes like education and income, implying that the influence of upbringing has limits compared to genetic influence ([techratchet.com](https://techratchet.com/2020/03/05/book-summary-the-son-also-rises-surnames-and-the-history-of-social-mobility-by-gregory-clarke/#:~:text=,biology%20is%20the%20fundamental%20cause)) ([techratchet.com](https://techratchet.com/2020/03/05/book-summary-the-son-also-rises-surnames-and-the-history-of-social-mobility-by-gregory-clarke/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20research%20on%20adoption%20outcomes%2C,%E2%80%9D%20%28p264)). (Clark notes, for example, that even if we equalized all family environments, much of the variance in outcomes would likely remain – perhaps only a 25% reduction in inequality ([techratchet.com](https://techratchet.com/2020/03/05/book-summary-the-son-also-rises-surnames-and-the-history-of-social-mobility-by-gregory-clarke/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20research%20on%20adoption%20outcomes%2C,%E2%80%9D%20%28p264)).) This view, admittedly provocative, posits that an underlying **“social competence”** or ability is passed on in families, maintaining elite or underclass status over generations ([techratchet.com](https://techratchet.com/2020/03/05/book-summary-the-son-also-rises-surnames-and-the-history-of-social-mobility-by-gregory-clarke/#:~:text=Most%20studies%20on%20social%20mobility,look%20at%20a%20single%20generation)) ([techratchet.com](https://techratchet.com/2020/03/05/book-summary-the-son-also-rises-surnames-and-the-history-of-social-mobility-by-gregory-clarke/#:~:text=%E2%80%9COne%20of%20the%20most%20powerful,p123)). The **strong heritability** of SES that Clark and others claim would mean social mobility is inherently limited by biology – a controversial interpretation that has sparked debate. Critics point out that such conclusions may underestimate environmental factors or societal barriers (and they worry about deterministic or even eugenic implications) ([www.pinkerite.com](https://www.pinkerite.com/2025/04/what-happened-to-adam-rutherford-part-3.html#:~:text=The%20Economist%20noted%3A)) ([www.pinkerite.com](https://www.pinkerite.com/2025/04/what-happened-to-adam-rutherford-part-3.html#:~:text=Clark%20,the%20foundation%20of%20Clark%27s%20beliefs)). Nonetheless, evidence is robust that genetics plays a significant role alongside environment in intergenerational social outcomes. Even in modern egalitarian societies, studies continue to find a substantial heritable component to status. For example, a recent analysis in Norway found that for adults around age 40, genetic differences accounted for roughly half of the variation in educational attainment and occupational prestige, whereas family environmental factors accounted for a smaller (but non-negligible) portion ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12078464/#:~:text=genetic%20and%20environmental%20sources%20of,shared%20environmental%20contributions)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12078464/#:~:text=status%20,dependence%20of%20SES%20determinants)). Interestingly, that same study noted that **wealth** (accumulated assets) had a somewhat different profile: shared family environment (which can include direct inheritance or parental financial support) mattered more for wealth levels, while genes played a slightly lesser role in wealth than in education or jobs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12078464/#:~:text=in%20estimates%20due%20to%20population,source%20for%20comparing%20heritability%20methods)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12078464/#:~:text=status%20,dependence%20of%20SES%20determinants)). This makes intuitive sense – **financial capital** can be given directly to children irrespective of their aptitudes, whereas education and career success depend more on personal traits. 

**Gene–environment interplay:** It’s crucial to emphasize that genetic influence on SES does *not* mean an individual’s destiny is fixed or that environment doesn’t matter. In reality, genes and environment work together in complex ways to shape life outcomes. One mechanism is called **gene–environment correlation** – people’s genetic traits can influence the kind of environments they experience. For instance, a child with a high genetic propensity for learning might seek out enrichment, get placed in advanced classes, or be noticed by teachers, creating a more supportive educational environment that further boosts their achievement. At the family level, researchers have observed “genetic nurture” effects: parents’ genes affect their own behaviors and resources (such as the value they place on education or their ability to earn money), and those behaviors create an environment that helps or hinders the child ([www.eurekalert.org](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/463685#:~:text=into%20adulthood,environment%20likely%20influence%20socioeconomic%20outcomes)) ([www.eurekalert.org](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/463685#:~:text=wealth%2C%20compared%20with%20their%20parents,environment%20likely%20influence%20socioeconomic%20outcomes)). A recent study of thousands of families in the US, UK, and New Zealand found that a mother’s polygenic score for education significantly predicted her children’s educational and economic success *independently* of the children’s own genes ([www.eurekalert.org](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/463685#:~:text=into%20adulthood,environment%20likely%20influence%20socioeconomic%20outcomes)) ([www.eurekalert.org](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/463685#:~:text=mother%27s%20polygenic%20score%20predicted%20her,environment%20likely%20influence%20socioeconomic%20outcomes)). In other words, well-educated, genetically advantaged parents tend to provide home environments (from better nutrition to more reading or networking opportunities) that further magnify the child’s chances of success – a combined genetic and social inheritance. Beyond the household, **assortative mating** is another factor: people often choose partners with similar education or income levels, which also tends to mean similar traits and even genetic profiles ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7617559/#:~:text=distribution%20of%20genes%20associated%20with,should%20be%20approached%20with%20caution)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7617559/#:~:text=socio,result%20in%20evolutionary%20selection%20pressures)). This leads to high-SES individuals concentrating their genes together, and the same for low-SES individuals, increasing genetic differences between social classes over time. One review described SES as a “dynamic social construct” that both involves genetically influenced traits *and* can alter the distribution of those traits in the population through social sorting mechanisms ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7617559/#:~:text=In%20civilizations%2C%20individuals%20are%20born,sorted%20into%20strata%20with%20different)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7617559/#:~:text=distribution%20of%20genes%20associated%20with,should%20be%20approached%20with%20caution)). For example, as university-educated adults increasingly meet and marry each other, their children receive a double dose of education-related genes (plus a rich environment), widening the gap in academic preparedness between high-SES and low-SES offspring ([www.factsandarts.com](https://www.factsandarts.com/essays/inequality-now-extends-peoples-dna?page=40#:~:text=We%20found%20that%20those%20with,with%20a%20competitive%20job%20market)) ([www.factsandarts.com](https://www.factsandarts.com/essays/inequality-now-extends-peoples-dna?page=40#:~:text=Why%20is%20this%20happening%3F%20Our,are%20for%20its%20polygenic%20score)). This sorting is visible even geographically: studies in the UK have found that people with higher education polygenic scores are more likely to move to thriving urban areas, while those with lower scores often remain in poorer regions ([www.factsandarts.com](https://www.factsandarts.com/essays/inequality-now-extends-peoples-dna?page=40#:~:text=We%20found%20that%20those%20with,with%20a%20competitive%20job%20market)) ([www.factsandarts.com](https://www.factsandarts.com/essays/inequality-now-extends-peoples-dna?page=40#:~:text=places%20but%20later%20left%20them,or%20moved%20to%20these%20areas)). Such migration creates genetic clustering, where affluent postcodes literally have a higher average genetic propensity for education than struggling post-industrial towns ([www.factsandarts.com](https://www.factsandarts.com/essays/inequality-now-extends-peoples-dna?page=40#:~:text=We%20found%20that%20those%20with,with%20a%20competitive%20job%20market)) ([www.factsandarts.com](https://www.factsandarts.com/essays/inequality-now-extends-peoples-dna?page=40#:~:text=In%20itself%2C%20this%20is%20not,poorer%20areas%20for%20richer%20ones)). In short, how genes influence SES cannot be separated from environment – genetics may nudge individuals toward certain environments, and society in turn channels and amplifies genetic advantages.

**Context and limitations:** The impact of genes on socio-economic outcomes is not fixed in stone; it responds to social context. Heritability estimates for traits like education or income can vary across countries and eras ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=Twin%20studies%20have%20estimated%20income,21)). Generally, in societies with more equal opportunity (or universal education and healthcare), environmental barriers are lowered, and genetic differences can explain relatively more of the remaining outcome variance ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=Twin%20studies%20have%20estimated%20income,21)). By contrast, in societies with rigid class barriers or discrimination, even the most capable individuals from poor backgrounds might be prevented from success, muting the expression of genetic talents. As evidence, historical changes show that when education became more universally accessible in the 20th century, the heritability of educational attainment actually rose – because fewer people were kept from schooling by external circumstances, genetic aptitudes played a larger role in who went furthest ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1801238115#:~:text=educational%20attainment%20have%20raised%20questions,linked)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=Twin%20studies%20have%20estimated%20income,21)). On the flip side, severe deprivation can suppress the realization of genetic potential (for example, a child with high genetic potential for learning may still struggle if raised in poverty and malnutrition). This means policy and environment modulate genetic effects. The Norwegian study cited above illustrates this nuance well: its results in a social-democratic setting showed sizable genetic influences, but also that family environment still accounted for a meaningful share of variance in certain outcomes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12078464/#:~:text=in%20estimates%20due%20to%20population,source%20for%20comparing%20heritability%20methods)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12078464/#:~:text=status%20,dependence%20of%20SES%20determinants)). Even Clark’s research, while emphasizing persistent inheritance, acknowledged that about 30–50% of status outcomes are **not** predicted by lineage ([techratchet.com](https://techratchet.com/2020/03/05/book-summary-the-son-also-rises-surnames-and-the-history-of-social-mobility-by-gregory-clarke/#:~:text=intergenerational%20correlation%20of%200,%E2%80%9D%20%28p262)) – implying luck, individual effort, and unique experiences continue to play a big role. In fact, many researchers stress that genetic influence **increases** the importance of providing supportive environments. If some people are born with slight disadvantages (be they in cognitive ability, health, etc.), good education and social support can compensate and help them achieve their potential. Meanwhile, those born with advantages can still fail to thrive if placed in a poor environment. In other words, genes influence probabilities, not final outcomes, and their effects can be blunted or exacerbated by social conditions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=Twin%20studies%20have%20estimated%20income,21)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7617559/#:~:text=distribution%20of%20genes%20associated%20with,should%20be%20approached%20with%20caution)).

Finally, it’s important to approach this topic with caution and humility. Discoveries about genes and SES have historically been misused to justify social hierarchies or racist ideologies ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7617559/#:~:text=also%20associated%20with%20genetic%20variation,human%20rights%2C%20including%20limiting%20access)) ([www.pinkerite.com](https://www.pinkerite.com/2025/04/what-happened-to-adam-rutherford-part-3.html#:~:text=The%20Economist%20noted%3A)). Modern researchers are careful to note that finding a genetic component in economic success *does not* mean society is a meritocracy or that inequalities are morally acceptable. Genes influence **who** rises to the top under given conditions, but they don’t inherently reflect *merit* or *worth*, and they certainly don’t mean rich people are “genetically superior” in any general sense. As one review emphasized, SES is a socially defined construct – what we reward (education, certain skills) could be different in a differently structured society – and genetic findings should be “approached with caution” to avoid misunderstanding or harm ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7617559/#:~:text=socio,sorted%20into%20strata%20with%20different)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7617559/#:~:text=distribution%20of%20genes%20associated%20with,should%20be%20approached%20with%20caution)). In summary, genes influence socio-economic status by endowing individuals with a varying palette of traits, propensities, and health profiles that aid or hinder their pursuit of education, jobs, and wealth. These biological factors contribute significantly to why SES runs in families and why some people find upward mobility easier than others. However, genetic influences unfold in interaction with upbringing, culture, and chance. Recognizing the role of genetics in SES can help us understand the mechanisms of social inequality – from education policies to health disparities – but it should also reinforce the importance of *creating environments where everyone, regardless of their genetic draw, can achieve a fulfilling life* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7617559/#:~:text=distribution%20of%20genes%20associated%20with,should%20be%20approached%20with%20caution)) ([www.pinkerite.com](https://www.pinkerite.com/2025/04/what-happened-to-adam-rutherford-part-3.html#:~:text=,certainly%20traffics%20in%20genetic%20determinism)).

He finds an underlying intergenerational “status correlation” around 0.7–0.8, remarkably stable across countries and eras. This implies that social status is highly persistent and **“inherited as strongly as height,”** suggesting that inherited abilities (whether genetic or cultural) largely determine one’s place in society ([techratchet.com](https://techratchet.com/2020/03/05/book-summary-the-son-also-rises-surnames-and-the-history-of-social-mobility-by-gregory-clarke/#:~:text=,personal%20choice%20and%20just%20plain)) ([techratchet.com](https://techratchet.com/2020/03/05/book-summary-the-son-also-rises-surnames-and-the-history-of-social-mobility-by-gregory-clarke/#:~:text=)). Clark controversially concludes that *nature predominates over nurture* in the long run ([techratchet.com](https://techratchet.com/2020/03/05/book-summary-the-son-also-rises-surnames-and-the-history-of-social-mobility-by-gregory-clarke/#:~:text=%E2%80%9COne%20of%20the%20most%20powerful,p123)) ([techratchet.com](https://techratchet.com/2020/03/05/book-summary-the-son-also-rises-surnames-and-the-history-of-social-mobility-by-gregory-clarke/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20research%20on%20adoption%20outcomes%2C,%E2%80%9D%20%28p264)). He recommends acknowledging this reality by reducing extreme inequalities (since a lot of “winning” comes from birth luck) rather than assuming complete meritocracy. Critics argue Clark’s work leans toward genetic determinism and underplays discrimination or policy effects ([www.pinkerite.com](https://www.pinkerite.com/2025/04/what-happened-to-adam-rutherford-part-3.html#:~:text=The%20Economist%20noted%3A)) ([www.pinkerite.com](https://www.pinkerite.com/2025/04/what-happened-to-adam-rutherford-part-3.html#:~:text=,certainly%20traffics%20in%20genetic%20determinism)).

They note that some of the same genes associated with educational attainment (found via polygenic scores) are also linked to health outcomes. For example, alleles that promote greater educational success may also predispose individuals to healthier behaviors or higher cognitive reserve, partially explaining why educated people tend to be healthier. The authors caution that gene–environment interplay (for instance, financially stressed environments amplifying genetic risks) means we must be careful in attributing causality – the genetic overlap (pleiotropy) can make it look like education “causes” health benefits when in part both are influenced by shared genetic dispositions.

5. **Hyytinen et al.,** *“Heritability of lifetime earnings,”* **Journal of Economic Inequality** (2019) ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10888-019-09413-x#:~:text=Using%20twenty%20years%20of%20earnings,the%20measure%20of%20genetic%20relatedness)): This study of Finnish twins estimates the heritability of labor earnings across the entire working life. The researchers found that about 40% of the variance in women’s lifetime earnings, and just over 50% in men’s, could be explained by genetic differences between individuals ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10888-019-09413-x#:~:text=Using%20twenty%20years%20of%20earnings,the%20measure%20of%20genetic%20relatedness)). In contrast, the contribution of shared family environment was essentially zero in their models ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10888-019-09413-x#:~:text=Using%20twenty%20years%20of%20earnings,the%20measure%20of%20genetic%20relatedness)), suggesting that factors like parental income or upbringing had little *consistent* effect on long-term earnings once genetic endowment was accounted for. (Unique environment and random events explained the remaining variance.) The authors also showed the results were robust to different ways of measuring earnings and adjusting for education, implying that genetics directly influences economic attainment through multiple channels, not only through educational achievement. *This high heritability estimate is context-specific (contemporary Finland) and doesn’t mean environment is unimportant – but it highlights a substantial genetic contribution to income inequality.*

They found that genetic factors consistently explained a large share of variance in educational attainment and occupational status in Norway’s population ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12078464/#:~:text=genetic%20and%20environmental%20sources%20of,Our%20results%20highlight)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12078464/#:~:text=status%20,dependence%20of%20SES%20determinants)). Family-shared environment played a comparatively larger role in determining individuals’ *wealth* (net worth) and also had a notable impact on education ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12078464/#:~:text=in%20estimates%20due%20to%20population,source%20for%20comparing%20heritability%20methods)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12078464/#:~:text=status%20,dependence%20of%20SES%20determinants)), whereas non-shared environment (personal experiences) dominated variation in income. The study underlines that **SES is multifaceted** – for example, one’s schooling and job level might be strongly tied to genetic aptitudes in a society with equal opportunities, while accumulated wealth might depend more on family circumstances (inheritance, gifts) even in a social democracy. Their results also highlighted substantial **common influences**: the same genetic factors often affected multiple SES measures, and likewise the same family environmental factors (like parental socio-economic resources) tended to boost several outcomes at once ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12078464/#:~:text=attainment%20and%20occupational%20prestige.%20Family,democratic%20welfare%20state)). Overall, this research illustrates how the balance of nature and nurture in socio-economic attainment can differ by outcome and context, and it provided a rigorous comparison of heritability estimation methods.

7. **Kweon et al.,** *“Associations between common genetic variants and income provide insights about the socio-economic health gradient,”* **Nature Human Behaviour** (2025) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=We%20conducted%20a%20genome,92)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=phenome,influences%20on%20income%20and%20health)): This large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) explored genetic influences on income and their relationship to health. The team identified 162 genetic loci associated with income (aggregated into an “Income polygenic factor”), each with a tiny effect ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=We%20conducted%20a%20genome,92)). The polygenic index derived from these variants explained only about 1–5% of income variation, and importantly *only about one-quarter of that predictive power appeared to reflect direct genetic effects* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=economic%20status%20and%20health%20disparities,that%20the%20remaining%20genetic%20signal)) – the rest may operate through gene–environment correlations. The genetic propensity for higher income was found to correlate very strongly with the genetics of educational attainment (RG ~0.92) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=phenome,influences%20on%20income%20and%20health)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=and%20back%20pain,reduced%20physical%20health%20and%20increased)), indicating that much of the genetic effect on income works via education-linked traits. Individuals with higher income polygenic scores also had lower risks for several common health problems (including hypertension, obesity, diabetes, depression, and others) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=with%20small%20effect%20sizes%20,These%20findings%20highlight%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=phenome,influences%20on%20income%20and%20health)), shedding light on why wealth correlates with better health. However, after statistically removing the genes shared with education, the remaining income-associated genes were linked to *better mental health but worse physical health and more risky behaviors* (like smoking/drinking) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=and%20back%20pain,influences%20on%20income%20and%20health)). This nuanced finding suggests multiple genetic pathways: some genetic advantages help people prosper financially *and* stay healthy, while other genetic pathways to higher income might involve traits (e.g. extreme competitiveness or stress tolerance) that come at a cost to bodily health. The authors conclude that genetic effects contribute to the socio-economic health gradient and call for more research into how societal factors modulate these relationships ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=Twin%20studies%20have%20estimated%20income,21)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12018258/#:~:text=realities,the%20socio)).

8. **Belsky et al.,** *“Genetic analysis of social-class mobility in five longitudinal studies,”* **PNAS** (2018) – *summary via EurekAlert (2020)* ([www.eurekalert.org](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/463685#:~:text=advantages%2C%20given%20that%20children%20inherit,child%27s%20success%20independently%20of%20the)) ([www.eurekalert.org](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/463685#:~:text=into%20adulthood,environment%20likely%20influence%20socioeconomic%20outcomes)): This international study investigated whether DNA-based measures can predict who rises or falls in social class relative to their parents. The researchers used a polygenic score for educational attainment (based on GWAS findings) in over 20,000 people from the U.S., U.K., and New Zealand. They found that individuals with higher education-linked polygenic scores were significantly more likely to achieve upward mobility – attaining higher education, occupations, and wealth than their parents – even after accounting for their family’s baseline social class ([www.eurekalert.org](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/463685#:~:text=advantages%2C%20given%20that%20children%20inherit,child%27s%20success%20independently%20of%20the)) ([www.eurekalert.org](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/463685#:~:text=into%20adulthood,environment%20likely%20influence%20socioeconomic%20outcomes)). Conversely, those with low scores were more prone to downward mobility. Notably, a mother’s polygenic score also predicted her child’s social attainments above and beyond the child’s own genes ([www.eurekalert.org](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/463685#:~:text=wealth%2C%20compared%20with%20their%20parents,environment%20likely%20influence%20socioeconomic%20outcomes)) ([www.eurekalert.org](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/463685#:~:text=mother%27s%20polygenic%20score%20predicted%20her,environment%20likely%20influence%20socioeconomic%20outcomes)). This indicates that **family environment mediated by parent’s genetics** (for example, more educated parents providing learning opportunities and connections) boosts the child’s chances. The authors interpret these results as evidence that genetics plays a role in social mobility, but outcomes are still jointly determined by the environments that parents create. In sum, *genetic endowments associated with education can help propel an individual up the socio-economic ladder, yet nurturing environments supplied by families remain critical for realizing that potential*.
