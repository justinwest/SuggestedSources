How genes matter for socio-economic status (SES)

1. Biological pathways  
   • DNA does not code for “rich” or “poor”.  Instead, genetic differences can shape intermediate traits – cognitive ability, personality, physical and mental health – that help or hinder success in school and work.  These traits then feed into educational attainment, occupational choice and earnings [1][2].  
   • This influence is therefore indirect and probabilistic; people with the same genetic make-up can end up in very different social positions when they grow up in different environments [1][2].

2. How much of the variation in status is genetic?  
   a) Classical twin/adoption studies  
      • Comparing identical with fraternal twins typically yields heritability estimates of about 30-50 % for education, occupational prestige and income in contemporary Western societies [1].  
   b) DNA-based (“polygenic”) studies  
      • Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of common genetic variants that are statistically associated with SES.  When these variants are added up into a polygenic score they currently explain only a small share of the individual differences: roughly 11 % of variance in years of education and about 7 % in household income in European ancestry samples [2].  
      • Part of this measured “genetic” effect actually reflects gene–environment correlations – e.g. parents who carry education-boosting alleles both pass on the alleles and create stimulating home and neighbourhood environments [1][2].

3. Inter-generational transmission  
   • Economic historian Gregory Clark, using surname persistence across centuries, argues that an underlying, highly heritable “social competence” (≈0.7 heritability) is responsible for the surprisingly slow rate of social mobility observed in many countries [3].  
   • Geneticists such as Adam Rutherford counter that Clark’s method cannot separate genes from inherited wealth, culture or networks, and that modern molecular data show much more modest direct genetic effects [1].

4. Limits of genetic prediction  
   • Even the best current polygenic scores leave most inequality unexplained and have low individual-level accuracy: many people with a low score end up prosperous and vice-versa [1][2].  
   • Signals can be inflated by subtle population stratification; if people who share ancestry also share social conditions, spurious gene–SES correlations arise unless studies are rigorously controlled [1][4].  

5. Policy implications  
   • Because genes exert most of their influence through changeable environments, social interventions (better schools, healthcare, anti-discrimination laws, redistributive taxation) can still move the SES needle considerably [1][2].  
   • Awareness of genetic influence therefore complements rather than replaces environmental approaches to reducing inequality.

In short, genetic differences contribute measurably but modestly to who ends up rich or poor.  They operate through traits such as intelligence and personality, are entangled with the environments families create and inherit, and leave plenty of room for social policy to foster mobility.
