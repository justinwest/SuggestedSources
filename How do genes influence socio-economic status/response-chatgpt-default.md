# How do genes influence socio-economic status?

## Genetic Influences on Traits Related to SES 
Socio-economic status (SES) – which includes education, income, and occupation – is shaped by many factors, including environmental opportunities and genetic predispositions. Genes do not directly determine one’s income or social class, but they can influence traits that help a person attain a higher SES. For example, cognitive abilities and educational attainment have substantial heritable components, meaning genetic differences contribute to individual variation in these traits. Twin and genomic studies find that common genetic variants account for a significant portion of the variation in educational achievement ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25754083/#:~:text=educational%20achievement%20and%20half%20of,its%20association%20with%20family%20SES)). These genetic influences on education also create an indirect link between genes and SES: people with genetic predispositions for higher cognitive ability or academic success tend to obtain more education and qualify for higher-paying jobs, contributing to higher SES. Indeed, family socio-economic background itself is partly influenced by genetics – parents pass on not only an environment but also genes that may predispose children to traits like intelligence or drive ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3907681/#:~:text=Environmental%20measures%20used%20widely%20in,association%20with%20children%27s%20IQ%20at)). In this way, the strong association between parental SES and child outcomes is partly mediated by shared genetic factors, alongside environmental inheritance.

## Evidence from Genetic Research on Socioeconomic Outcomes 
Recent genetic studies provide direct evidence that DNA differences are linked to socio-economic outcomes. Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many gene variants associated with years of education, and composite *polygenic scores* built from these GWAS can **modestly** predict a person’s educational and economic success ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1801238115#:~:text=Genome,attainment%20over%20and%20above%20the)) ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1801238115#:~:text=countries,influences%20attainment%20directly%20through%20social)). For instance, one study found that common genetic variants explained roughly one-third of the variance in students’ educational test scores at age 16, and about half of the correlation between those scores and the family’s SES ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25754083/#:~:text=educational%20achievement%20and%20half%20of,its%20association%20with%20family%20SES)). The same study showed that a polygenic score for education (combining thousands of genetic markers) could explain about ~3% of the differences in academic achievement and even ~2.5% of the variation in family SES among a sample of UK children ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25754083/#:~:text=educational%20achievement%20and%20half%20of,its%20association%20with%20family%20SES)). Another international analysis examined “social mobility” and found that individuals with higher education-linked polygenic scores tended to achieve higher social status than their parents, indicating that genetic factors can propel upward mobility ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1801238115#:~:text=Genome,attainment%20over%20and%20above%20the)) ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1801238115#:~:text=countries,influences%20attainment%20directly%20through%20social)). Notably, the same analysis showed an environmental effect of parental genes: a mother’s education-associated genetics predicted her children’s educational attainment above and beyond the child’s own genes ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1801238115#:~:text=countries,influences%20attainment%20directly%20through%20social)). This phenomenon – sometimes called *genetic nurture* – occurs because parents’ genes can shape the home environment (for example, a parent’s genetically influenced education level might lead to a more enriching environment), which in turn affects the child’s development. Overall, such findings reject the idea that genetic influences on SES are merely reflecting inherited privilege; instead, they indicate that genes actively contribute to socio-economic attainments both *directly* (via the individual’s talents and traits) and *indirectly* (via family and social environments) ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1801238115#:~:text=children%E2%80%99s%20own%20genetics%2C%20indicating%20an,and%20indirectly%20through%20family%20environments)).

## Direct and Indirect Pathways of Genetic Influence 
**Direct genetic effects** on SES operate through genetically influenced traits in the individual. Cognitive ability (IQ) is one clear example: it has moderate-to-high heritability, and higher cognitive ability facilitates academic and job performance, which are rewarded in educational systems and labor markets. Personality traits such as perseverance, self-discipline, and social savvy also show genetic influence to a lesser degree and can affect career success. Thousands of genetic variants each have tiny effects on these traits, but in aggregate they can tilt probabilities – for example, making someone slightly more likely to thrive in school, learn complex skills, or innovate. These small advantages accumulate, increasing the likelihood of attaining degrees, professional jobs, or higher earnings. **Indirect genetic effects** involve the environments that correlate with one’s genotype. As mentioned, an educated or economically successful parent may provide more learning resources, better nutrition, or a network of opportunities for their child. Part of the reason well-off families raise successful children is that the parents endow both genes and a nurturing environment to their offspring. Such gene–environment correlations mean the child’s advantages come from both nature *and* nurture acting in concert ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3907681/#:~:text=Environmental%20measures%20used%20widely%20in,association%20with%20children%27s%20IQ%20at)) ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1801238115#:~:text=countries,influences%20attainment%20directly%20through%20social)). Moreover, people often select or shape their own environments based on their genetic predispositions (for instance, a bookish child – due in part to genetics – might seek out more educational opportunities, further boosting their SES prospects). There is also evidence that assortative mating (people tending to partner with others of similar education or ability) concentrates certain genetic propensities in families or social strata over generations ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7617559/#:~:text=In%20civilizations%2C%20individuals%20are%20born,Social%20stratification%20results)). This can reinforce socio-economic differences, as children from high-SES households are more likely to inherit cumulative genetic advantages for education-related traits, whereas those from disadvantaged backgrounds may not, on average.

## Gene-Environment Interactions and Moderation 
Crucially, genetic influence on SES is **context-dependent**. Genes may set a range of potential, but the environment determines where along that range an individual falls. In supportive environments with good schools, adequate nutrition, and stability, a child’s genetic potentials (e.g. for learning or skill development) can be more fully realized. By contrast, in deprived or chaotic environments, even a child with high genetic potential might not achieve their potential. Some researchers have hypothesized that social disadvantage *“compromises the extent to which a child’s genetic potential is realized,”* meaning genetic effects on abilities are smaller in harsh conditions ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1708491114#:~:text=sometimes%20called%20the%20Scarr,implies%20that%20higher%20heritability%20estimates)). In other words, when children grow up in poverty or under chronic stress, those environmental barriers can mask or suppress the expression of genetic differences in academic or cognitive outcomes. Studies in the United States initially seemed to support this idea (often called the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis), suggesting that heritability of IQ or school achievement was lower in low-SES families and higher in high-SES families. However, later and larger studies have found mixed evidence for this interaction, with some not detecting a strong SES moderation effect ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1708491114#:~:text=used%20matched%20birth%20and%20school,and%20elusive%20than%20previously%20supposed)) ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1708491114#:~:text=Although%20past%20research%20has%20found,level%20administrative%20data%20in%20the)). Regardless, it is well accepted that **genes and environment work together** in complex ways to shape life outcomes. Favorable environments (e.g. quality education, healthcare, and social support) can amplify the benefits of positive genetic predispositions and even help individuals overcome genetic vulnerabilities. On the other hand, adverse environments can blunt the advantages of a “good” genetic hand. Therefore, while genes influence socio-economic status, their effects are not fixed destinies – context and personal choices remain profoundly important.

## Conclusions and Considerations 
In summary, genes influence socio-economic status indirectly by affecting the development of traits – like intelligence, motivation, and health – that help individuals navigate the educational and economic opportunities in society. Modern research estimates that a non-trivial fraction of the variation in educational and occupational outcomes is associated with genetic differences ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25754083/#:~:text=educational%20achievement%20and%20half%20of,its%20association%20with%20family%20SES)) ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1801238115#:~:text=Genome,attainment%20over%20and%20above%20the)). At the same time, genetic influence on SES is only one piece of the puzzle. Social, economic, and policy factors play major roles in determining opportunities, and genetic effects express themselves through these environmental structures. It is also important to remember that genetic influences on complex outcomes are probabilistic and polygenic: thousands of genes each contribute a very small effect, and no single “SES gene” exists. The interplay of nature and nurture means two people with similar genetic predispositions can end up very differently if their environments diverge. Researchers stress that discoveries about genes and SES should be approached with caution and humility ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7617559/#:~:text=distribution%20of%20genes%20associated%20with,a%20fair%20and%20functional%20society)). Historically, misinterpretations of genetics in social outcomes have led to harmful ideologies, so it’s crucial to use this knowledge to inform equitable policy (for example, recognizing which early interventions can help all children realize their potential) rather than to pigeonhole individuals. In conclusion, genes *do* influence socio-economic status by shaping personal attributes and interactions with the environment, but they operate in tandem with upbringing, culture, education, and chance. A full understanding of SES must integrate both genetic and environmental perspectives to appreciate why individuals and families have different socio-economic trajectories ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7617559/#:~:text=In%20civilizations%2C%20individuals%20are%20born,Social%20stratification%20results)) ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1801238115#:~:text=children%E2%80%99s%20own%20genetics%2C%20indicating%20an,and%20indirectly%20through%20family%20environments)).

Using a sample of ~3,000 UK children, the authors found that common genetic variants explained about 33% of the variance in GCSE exam scores and about half of the correlation between those scores and parental SES. They also reported that a polygenic score for education predicted a small but significant portion of the variance in both academic performance and family SES, underscoring that genetics contributes to educational success and is one factor behind the link between family background and child achievement. *(Mol Psychiatry, 2015, **PMC4486001**)* [`pmc.nih.gov`](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4486001/)

(2018)** – *Genetic analysis of social mobility:* Belsky and colleagues examined whether “education-linked” genetic factors truly propel socio-economic success or merely reflect one’s upbringing. Analyzing over 20,000 individuals in multiple cohort studies, they found that people with higher education polygenic scores tended to achieve higher SES than their parents (evidence of genetic influence on upward mobility). They also showed that a mother’s polygenic score predicted her child’s educational attainment independent of the child’s own genes, indicating that parental genes foster a favorable environment (a social-genetic effect). The authors conclude that genetics impacts socio-economic attainment both directly (via personal traits that aid mobility) and indirectly (through genetically influenced family environments), rather than SES being solely a product of inherited social advantage. *(PNAS, 115(31), 2018)* [`pnas.org`](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1801238115) 

3. **Trzaskowski et al. (2014)** – *Genetic influence on family SES and children’s IQ:* This research team demonstrated that what we often think of as an “environmental” factor – family socio-economic status – is itself partly shaped by genetic differences. By analyzing DNA data from about 3,000 unrelated children, they found significant genetic influence on the SES of the families in which children were raised. Moreover, genes accounted for part of the correlation between family SES and children’s intelligence (IQ) scores. In other words, the same genetic factors that influence cognitive ability also incline parents toward higher SES, creating an overlap between the genetic effects on a child’s environment and on the child’s IQ. The authors emphasize that ignoring genetics in social science research can misattribute causes: policies aimed at reducing SES disparities in children’s outcomes should consider that family environment and child traits are not purely independent. *(Intelligence, 42, 83–88, 2014)* [`ncbi.nlm.nih.gov`](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3907681/) 

4. **Abdellaoui et al. (2025)** – *Socio-economic status as a social construct with genetic components:* In this comprehensive review, the authors discuss how social stratification can lead to genetic differences between socio-economic groups over time, even though SES is a human-made construct. They describe that individuals’ genetically influenced traits (such as cognitive abilities, personality, or health factors) can help them attain or maintain a certain socio-economic position ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7617559/#:~:text=In%20civilizations%2C%20individuals%20are%20born,sorted%20into%20strata%20with%20different)). As a result, alleles associated with advantageous traits become more common in higher-SES subpopulations, a form of nonrandom genetic sorting. The paper reviews historical and modern findings showing a robust association between genetic variation and SES, while warning that these patterns **do not imply a rigid genetic destiny**. The authors urge caution in interpretation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7617559/#:~:text=distribution%20of%20genes%20associated%20with,a%20fair%20and%20functional%20society)), noting that understanding genetic influences on SES should be used to inform policy and reduce inequality, rather than to justify social hierarchies. *(Nat Hum Behav, 9:864–876, 2025)* [`nature.com`](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02150-4)
