Based on the provided sources, immigration has demonstrably affected the safety of women in specific contexts within Europe, particularly through patterns of sexual assault and exploitation linked to certain immigrant populations and systemic failures by authorities to address the issue.

### United Kingdom: Grooming Gangs and Institutional Failures
In the UK, a significant impact on the safety of women and girls has been documented in the context of group-based Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE), often referred to as "grooming gangs." An official government audit, known as the Casey audit, investigated these gangs and found that the perpetrators were disproportionately men of Pakistani heritage, while the victims were overwhelmingly vulnerable white girls [1]. The report criticizes authorities, including police and social services, for a collective failure to tackle the problem, partly due to a fear of being accused of racism. This hesitation allowed the abuse to continue for years in towns like Rotherham and Rochdale [1, 8].

Commentators argue that this was not just a failure but a deliberate cover-up rooted in political correctness, where the ethnicity of the perpetrators was intentionally downplayed or ignored by officials and the media [3, 8, 9]. This reluctance to confront the specific demographic nature of the crime created an environment where thousands of girls were abused over decades [9].

### Germany: The 2015-16 New Year's Eve Assaults
A pivotal event that brought the issue of migrant crime and women's safety to the forefront was the widespread sexual assault of women in several German cities on New Year's Eve 2015–16, most notably in Cologne [7]. On that night, large groups of men, described by police and victims as being of "North African or Arab appearance," surrounded and sexually assaulted hundreds of women [5, 7].

The official investigation concluded that the perpetrators were predominantly recent asylum seekers and illegal migrants who had arrived during the 2015 migrant crisis [7]. The event caused public outrage and a significant shift in the German debate on immigration, integration, and security [6, 7]. Some commentators view this event as a dramatic illustration of the consequences of large-scale migration from cultures with different norms regarding women [5, 6].

### Sweden: Crime Statistics and Gang Violence
In Sweden, data analysis indicates a disproportionate representation of immigrants in crime statistics, especially for violent and sexual offenses. One analysis of official data shows that foreign-born individuals are significantly overrepresented as suspects in rape cases. Specifically, men born in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region were registered as suspects for rape over five times more often than native-born Swedes [2].

Beyond individual sexual offenses, Sweden has experienced a surge in organized gang violence, including bombings and shootings, which has eroded the country's long-standing image of peace and safety [4]. This violence is concentrated in socially deprived areas with high immigrant populations and is linked to failed integration policies. While not always directly targeted at women, this dramatic increase in public violence has contributed to a widespread sense of insecurity that affects the entire society, including women's freedom of movement and feelings of safety [4].

### Summary of Effects
The provided sources indicate that immigration has affected women's safety in several ways:
*   **Specific Crime Patterns:** The emergence of distinct crime patterns, such as the UK's grooming gangs and the coordinated sexual assaults in Germany, has been directly linked to specific immigrant communities [1, 7].
*   **Statistical Overrepresentation:** In countries like Sweden, individuals with immigrant backgrounds, particularly from certain regions, are statistically overrepresented in convictions for sexual offenses [2].
*   **Institutional Paralysis:** A fear of being labeled racist has, at times, led authorities to fail to adequately investigate and prosecute crimes committed by perpetrators from minority backgrounds, thereby sacrificing the safety of victims [1, 3, 8].
*   **Erosion of Public Safety:** A broader increase in violent crime linked to immigrant gangs and failed integration in countries like Sweden has contributed to a general decline in public safety, which has a profound impact on women [4].
