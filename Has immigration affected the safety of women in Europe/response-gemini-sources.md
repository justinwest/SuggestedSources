The question of whether immigration has affected the safety of women in Europe is a complex and highly contentious topic. The provided sources point to specific high-profile criminal cases, statistical correlations in certain countries, and a polarized public debate, suggesting that in specific contexts, immigration has been linked to crimes against women. However, the causes and extent of this impact are intensely disputed.

### High-Profile Incidents and Public Perception
A key event that brought this issue to the forefront was the 2015-16 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany. In Cologne and other German cities, large groups of men, described in official reports and media coverage as being predominantly of North African or Arab appearance, engaged in widespread sexual assault, theft, and robbery [7]. The scale of the attacks, involving over 1,200 victims and more than 2,000 perpetrators in multiple cities, profoundly shocked the public and shifted the discourse on the integration of refugees and migrants who had arrived during the 2015 migrant crisis [7, 5]. Some commentators argue that such incidents are not isolated but represent a persistent threat resulting from migration policies [5].

### Child Sexual Exploitation in the United Kingdom
In the United Kingdom, the issue has been closely linked to cases of organized, group-based Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE), often referred to as "grooming gangs." A 2020 national audit by Baroness Casey found that while most child sexual abuse is perpetrated by white men within the family, there are specific CSE cases involving groups where perpetrators are disproportionately men of Pakistani heritage [1]. The report noted that victims were overwhelmingly white, and that in some cases, the fear of being accused of racism created a "reluctance to openly and honestly discuss the specific characteristics of this offending" by police and local authorities, hindering an effective response [1]. Other writers argue more forcefully that this represents a decades-long, deliberate cover-up by British authorities to avoid acknowledging the ethnic dimension of these crimes [3, 8].

### Statistical Trends and Crime in Sweden
Sweden has also experienced a significant public debate over immigration and crime. The country, once known for its safety, has seen a dramatic rise in gang-related violence, including bombings and shootings, which has eroded its peaceful self-image [4]. While much of this violence is gang-on-gang, analysis of crime statistics has shown a disproportionate representation of immigrants in crime, including sexual offenses.

One data-driven analysis of Swedish crime statistics from 1985–2021 indicates that foreign-born individuals are overrepresented as suspects in most crime categories, including rape [2]. The analysis shows this overrepresentation persists even when comparing first-generation immigrants to their Swedish-born children, although it decreases in the second generation. Official data from the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention (Brå) confirms this overrepresentation but also highlights that the vast majority of people with a foreign background are not suspected of any crime and that differences in crime rates can be largely explained by socioeconomic factors such as income, unemployment, and living conditions [9].

### Differing European Perspectives
The issue is viewed differently across the continent. An article from Deutsche Welle highlights a divergence between Western and Eastern Europe. It suggests that some in Eastern European nations view the social problems in Western Europe, including crime and perceived threats to women's safety, as a direct consequence of its liberal immigration policies and multiculturalism. This perspective contrasts with the Western European emphasis on tolerance, which critics from the East sometimes view as a "pretension" that ignores negative societal outcomes [6].

In summary, the sources indicate a link between immigration and specific, severe issues affecting women's safety in parts of Europe. This is seen in high-profile mass assaults like those in Cologne, the specific pattern of CSE grooming gangs in the UK, and the overrepresentation of foreign-born individuals in sexual offense statistics in countries like Sweden [2, 7, 1]. However, official sources and further research caution against simplistic explanations, pointing to the role of socioeconomic marginalization, age demographics, and the failures of state institutions in addressing these crimes effectively [1, 9]. The issue remains a focal point of intense political and social division across Europe [6].
