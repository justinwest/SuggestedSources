Europe has seen heated debate about whether recent immigration has made women less safe. High-profile incidents have fueled public concern – for example, during New Year’s Eve 2015–16 in Germany, around 1,200 women were sexually assaulted or robbed in coordinated attacks, which police linked largely to groups of young immigrant men of North African origin ([globalnews.ca](https://globalnews.ca/news/2817364/at-least-1200-women-assaulted-at-german-new-years-eve-celebrations-leaked-documents/#:~:text=Munich,in%202016%20across%20the%20country)) ([edition.cnn.com](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/05/europe/germany-cologne-new-year-assaults/index.html#:~:text=Sexual%20assaults%20and%20muggings%20were,Germany%2C%20on%20New%20Year%27s%20Eve)). Such events intensified fears that an influx of migrants (many of them single young men) would lead to more violence against women. 

Beyond isolated incidents, some statistics do indicate a disproportionate involvement of immigrants in crimes against women. In England and Wales, recent Home Office data revealed that foreign nationals are arrested for sexual offenses at roughly **3.5 times** the rate of British nationals – accounting for a far higher share of such arrests than their share of the population ([europeanconservative.com](https://europeanconservative.com/articles/news/report-mass-migration-prompts-spike-in-violence-against-women-and-girls/#:~:text=The%20arrest%20data%20also%20shows%C2%A0,times%20higher%20than%20for%20Brits)). Similarly, a comprehensive **Swedish study (2000–2020)** found that men with immigrant backgrounds were significantly overrepresented among those convicted of rape against adult women. Even after controlling for socioeconomic and psychiatric factors, immigrants (especially first-generation immigrants born outside Sweden) had higher odds of rape convictions than native-born men, indicating a persisting imbalance ([journals.sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/08862605241311611?icid=int.sj-full-text.citing-articles.1#:~:text=convicted%20of%20rape%20were%20higher,especially%20for%20those%20born%20outside)). These findings suggest that in some countries and contexts, certain immigrant groups have been involved in sexual violence at higher rates, which can *negatively affect women’s safety* in those communities. Analysts have posited factors like integration difficulties, young male demographics, and cultural differences as potential contributors to this overrepresentation ([journals.sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/08862605241311611?icid=int.sj-full-text.citing-articles.1#:~:text=between%20immigrant%20background%20and%20rape,of%20rape%2B%20need%20further%20exploration)) ([journals.sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/08862605241311611?icid=int.sj-full-text.citing-articles.1#:~:text=Historical%20data%20have%20delineated%20the,in%20criminal%20activities%2C%20which%20is)). 

On the other hand, **broad research and crime data** across Europe do not show a clear causal link between higher immigration and overall violence against women. In Germany, for instance, recent analysis of crime statistics by the ifo Institute (covering 2018–2023) found *no statistical correlation* between an increasing share of foreign-born residents and local crime rates – including **violent crimes such as sexual assault** ([www.ifo.de](https://www.ifo.de/en/press-release/2025-02-18/more-foreigners-do-not-increase-germanys-crime-rate#:~:text=Foreigners%20are%20overrepresented%20in%20the,%E2%80%9D)) ([www.ifo.de](https://www.ifo.de/en/press-release/2025-02-18/more-foreigners-do-not-increase-germanys-crime-rate#:~:text=natives%20is%20not%20tenable)). This aligns with a wider academic consensus that immigration *has not* led to rising crime in host countries. According to the ifo researchers, immigrants may appear “overrepresented” in crime statistics **in raw numbers**, but this is explained by non-cultural factors: migrants are more likely to be young, male, and concentrated in high-crime urban areas – factors that also apply to certain native-born populations ([www.ifo.de](https://www.ifo.de/en/press-release/2025-02-18/more-foreigners-do-not-increase-germanys-crime-rate#:~:text=Foreigners%20are%20overrepresented%20in%20the,%E2%80%9D)). When controlling for such variables, the supposed link between immigration and higher crime **disappears**, and immigrants and refugees do *not* exhibit a greater propensity for violence than demographically similar natives ([www.ifo.de](https://www.ifo.de/en/press-release/2025-02-18/more-foreigners-do-not-increase-germanys-crime-rate#:~:text=to%20settle%20in%20metropolitan%20areas%2C,%E2%80%9D)). In fact, one long-term German study found that any slight uptick in crime during early waves of immigration was offset by decreases in later years, resulting in **no overall increase** in crime rates over time due to immigration ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268123001713#:~:text=The%20effect%20is%20positive%20for,insignificant%20for%20the%20later%20one)). 

**In summary,** the impact of immigration on the safety of women in Europe is complex and context-dependent. Specific incidents and certain statistics show that *some* immigrant groups have committed sexual offenses at higher rates, which understandably raises public safety concerns ([europeanconservative.com](https://europeanconservative.com/articles/news/report-mass-migration-prompts-spike-in-violence-against-women-and-girls/#:~:text=The%20arrest%20data%20also%20shows%C2%A0,times%20higher%20than%20for%20Brits)) ([journals.sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/08862605241311611?icid=int.sj-full-text.citing-articles.1#:~:text=convicted%20of%20rape%20were%20higher,especially%20for%20those%20born%20outside)). However, large-scale evidence does not support the notion of a blanket deterioration in women’s safety caused by immigration. Most immigrants are law-abiding, and differences in crime rates are largely driven by underlying demographics and social conditions rather than immigration status alone ([www.ifo.de](https://www.ifo.de/en/press-release/2025-02-18/more-foreigners-do-not-increase-germanys-crime-rate#:~:text=Foreigners%20are%20overrepresented%20in%20the,%E2%80%9D)). Effective integration – through education, employment, and community engagement – is often highlighted as key to reducing any crime risks in migrant populations. In essence, while *isolated cases* of migrant-perpetrated violence against women have occurred and should be addressed, immigration per se has **not** made Europe uniformly more dangerous for women according to broad data and research [^1][^2]. The overall consensus is that **women’s safety is shaped by many factors** – and immigration is just one piece of a much larger puzzle.

It concludes that **increasing immigration has *not* led to higher crime rates in Germany**, *even for violent offenses like sexual assault*. The report notes that while foreigners appear overrepresented in crime stats, this is due to factors like their concentration in urban areas and younger male demographics; once such factors are accounted for, immigrants **do not have a higher crime propensity** than comparable natives.

The piece emphasizes that this outcome is *in line with academic consensus* across many countries – namely, that immigration has **no systematic impact on overall criminality**. **URL:** [dw.com/en/immigration-has-not-raised-german-crime-rate/a-71691228](https://www.dw.com/en/immigration-has-not-raised-german-crime-rate/a-71691228)  

[^1]: It’s important to note that crime reporting and definitions vary by country. For instance, countries like Sweden have broadened legal definitions of sexual offenses and promote reporting, which can increase recorded cases without an actual rise in incidents ([www.government.se](https://www.government.se/articles/2017/02/facts-about-migration-and-crime-in-sweden/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20willingness%20to%20report%20sexual,MeToo%20and%20other)). Thus, interpreting international comparisons requires caution.  
[^2]: Refugee and migrant women themselves face significant risks of sexual and gender-based violence, especially during transit and in reception centers ([www.unhcr.org](https://www.unhcr.org/news/news-releases/report-warns-refugee-women-move-europe-are-risk-sexual-and-gender-based-violence#:~:text=Report%20warns%20refugee%20women%20on,are%20at%20risk%20of%20sexual)) ([www.infomigrants.net](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/53259/exclusive-women-and-children-risk-rape-and-sexual-violence-at-all-stages-of-eu-migration#:~:text=Exclusive%3A%20Women%20and%20children%20risk,than%20elsewhere%20in)). However, this is a separate issue concerning the safety of *female migrants*, not the impact of migrants on the safety of women in host populations.
