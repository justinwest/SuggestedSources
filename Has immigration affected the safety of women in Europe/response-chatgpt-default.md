Europe’s recent waves of immigration – especially the 2015–2016 refugee influx – have prompted debate about women’s safety. High-profile incidents fueled public concern. For example, on New Year’s Eve 2015 in Cologne, Germany, large groups of young men (many reportedly of North African or Middle Eastern origin) robbed and sexually assaulted women in crowds ([www.bbc.com](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35261988#:~:text=The%20stories%20of%20women%20running,tapped%20into%20society%27s%20deepest%20fears)). In Cologne alone, over 500 incidents were reported that night (about 40% of them sexual assaults), tapping into deep public fears ([www.bbc.com](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35261988#:~:text=The%20stories%20of%20women%20running,tapped%20into%20society%27s%20deepest%20fears)). Similar attacks were reported in other German cities during the festivities ([time.com](https://time.com/4174614/cologne-crimes-500-merkel-refugees-sexual-assault/#:~:text=were%20reported%20in%20Hamburg%20and,In%202015%2C%20Germany%20received)). These events shocked Europeans and were widely blamed on newly arrived migrants, putting immigration in the spotlight regarding women’s security. Anti-immigrant groups seized on the assaults, while women’s rights activists cautioned against hysteria ([time.com](https://time.com/4174614/cologne-crimes-500-merkel-refugees-sexual-assault/#:~:text=were%20reported%20in%20Hamburg%20and,In%202015%2C%20Germany%20received)). In the aftermath, German officials condemned the violence and moved quickly to tighten laws. Chancellor Angela Merkel supported a **“No means no”** reform broadening the definition of rape and making it easier to deport foreign nationals convicted of sexual offenses ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/07/07/why-stricter-sexual-assault-laws-in-germany-make-refugee-activists-uneasy/#:~:text=BERLIN%C2%A0%E2%80%94%20After%C2%A0mass%20sexual%20assaults%20in,related%20offenses)). The German parliament passed these stricter sexual-assault laws within months of the Cologne attacks ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/07/07/why-stricter-sexual-assault-laws-in-germany-make-refugee-activists-uneasy/#:~:text=BERLIN%C2%A0%E2%80%94%20After%C2%A0mass%20sexual%20assaults%20in,related%20offenses)). The swift response underscored a determination to punish offenders and reassure the public that women’s safety remained paramount.  

Despite these notorious cases, **overall data do not show a broad rise in violence against women due to immigration**. In Germany, studies have found *no statistical link* between higher migrant populations and higher crime rates ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/higher-proportion-migrants-does-not-mean-more-crime-german-institute-says-2025-02-18/#:~:text=number%20of%20foreigners%20in%20Germany,in%20the%20electoral%20debate%2C%20notably)). A 2025 analysis by the Ifo institute (using police data from 2018–2023) concluded that more foreigners *do not lead to more crime* ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/higher-proportion-migrants-does-not-mean-more-crime-german-institute-says-2025-02-18/#:~:text=number%20of%20foreigners%20in%20Germany,in%20the%20electoral%20debate%2C%20notably)). While migrants may appear often in crime statistics, researchers note this is largely because many settle in urban high-crime areas – not because immigration inherently makes them more violent ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/higher-proportion-migrants-does-not-mean-more-crime-german-institute-says-2025-02-18/#:~:text=following%20violent%20migrant,in%20the%20electoral%20debate%2C%20notably)). In fact, soon after the 2015 refugee influx, German authorities observed a decline in crime by asylum seekers. Germany’s Federal Criminal Police (BKA) reported that by late 2016 the number of offenses committed by migrants had dropped about **23%** compared to early 2016 ([www.dw.com](https://www.dw.com/en/migrants-committing-fewer-crimes-according-to-bka-report/a-36959881#:~:text=Crime%20down%20by%20a%20quarter)) ([www.dw.com](https://www.dw.com/en/migrants-committing-fewer-crimes-according-to-bka-report/a-36959881#:~:text=asylum,percent%C2%A0compared%20to%20the%20first%20quarter)). Moreover, the vast majority of these offenses were minor or domestic in nature. Many incidents involved fare-dodging, theft, or altercations in refugee shelters, rather than attacks on the general public ([www.dw.com](https://www.dw.com/en/migrants-committing-fewer-crimes-according-to-bka-report/a-36959881#:~:text=trivialities,people%20evading%20public%20transport%20fares)). Only a small fraction of violent crimes by recent migrants were sexual assaults or targeted strangers. According to the BKA, roughly **1.3%** of violent crimes committed by migrants in 2016 were sexual offenses, and only about **6%** of migrant violent incidents were directed at non-migrants ([www.dw.com](https://www.dw.com/en/migrants-committing-fewer-crimes-according-to-bka-report/a-36959881#:~:text=Around%20a%20quarter%20of%20all,reported%C2%A0acts%20of%20causing%20bodily%20harm)). These figures suggest that the kind of stranger sexual violence seen in Cologne was *atypical* and not reflective of a widespread trend.  

**Sweden** provides a similar reality-check. Sweden took in more refugees per capita than any other EU country in 2015, which led to international speculation about a “crime wave.” However, Swedish data show *no significant increase* in violence against women attributable to immigrants ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2017/feb/24/trump-fox-news-and-the-truth-about-in-sweden-in-data#:~:text=The%20data%20tells%20us%20that,12%20times%20that%20of%20Sweden)). When U.S. media claimed that refugee admissions had caused surging rapes in Sweden, Swedish officials debunked it: *“The data tells us that there was no surge in ... rape in 2015, when Sweden accepted more than 160,000 refugees,”* according to a Guardian analysis of crime statistics ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2017/feb/24/trump-fox-news-and-the-truth-about-in-sweden-in-data#:~:text=The%20data%20tells%20us%20that,12%20times%20that%20of%20Sweden)). Sweden’s National Crime Survey for 2015 likewise found that overall exposure to crime was roughly unchanged over the long term – about 13% of Swedes reported being victims of crime in 2015, a level *similar to a decade earlier* ([www.politifact.com](https://www.politifact.com/article/2017/feb/20/what-statistics-say-about-immigration-and-sweden/#:~:text=A%202016%20Swedish%20Crime%20Survey,offences%2C%20robbery%2C%20fraud%20or%20harassment)). Notably, Sweden’s recorded rape numbers had risen over the 2000s due in part to broader legal definitions and greater reporting, not simply the arrival of immigrants ([www.politifact.com](https://www.politifact.com/article/2017/feb/20/what-statistics-say-about-immigration-and-sweden/#:~:text=The%20amount%20of%20reported%20rape,can%20be%20classified%20as%20rape)). In short, there is *no clear evidence* that the large inflow of asylum seekers in Sweden (or Europe generally) caused a spike in sexual violence. Public *perception* of danger may have grown – amplified by media coverage of incidents – but crime statistics have not shown a dramatic uptick in attacks on women linked to migrants ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2017/feb/24/trump-fox-news-and-the-truth-about-in-sweden-in-data#:~:text=The%20data%20tells%20us%20that,12%20times%20that%20of%20Sweden)).  

Women’s rights organizations and experts stress that it is crucial to keep these issues in perspective. They argue that focusing solely on immigrant-perpetrated assaults can distort the broader reality of gender-based violence. **Violence against women was already pervasive in Europe before the migration crisis** – an estimated one in three European women have experienced physical or sexual violence in their lifetime ([pace.coe.int](https://pace.coe.int/en/files/22437/html#:~:text=Violence%20against%20women%20is%20one,should%20be%20brought%20to%20justice)). Advocates point out that *“this kind of harassment and violence has been going on for a long time in every country”*, and it is *“wrong to describe the problem as specific to refugees”* ([time.com](https://time.com/4182186/sweden-feminists-sexual-assault-refugees/#:~:text=wrong%20to%20describe%20the%20problem,%E2%80%9D)). In other words, the *common denominator* in such attacks is male perpetrators, not immigrant status ([time.com](https://time.com/4182186/sweden-feminists-sexual-assault-refugees/#:~:text=wrong%20to%20describe%20the%20problem,%E2%80%9D)). A 2016 Council of Europe report similarly emphasized that violence against women *“cannot be considered a cultural problem”* brought in by newcomers – it is a fundamental societal problem across all cultures ([pace.coe.int](https://pace.coe.int/en/files/22437/html#:~:text=Violence%20against%20women%20is%20one,should%20be%20brought%20to%20justice)). Many feminists have walked a fine line: they condemn the Cologne-type attacks and support measures to ensure women’s safety, **while** warning against xenophobic generalizations that cast all migrant men as a threat ([time.com](https://time.com/4182186/sweden-feminists-sexual-assault-refugees/#:~:text=a%20political%20weapons%20against%20refugees,%E2%80%9CThere%20is%20a%20long%20post)). Some advocated for better integration and education for refugees about European gender-equality norms, rather than blanket blame ([time.com](https://time.com/4182186/sweden-feminists-sexual-assault-refugees/#:~:text=match%20at%20L138%20equality%20for,is%20hard%20to%20combine%20these)). This balanced approach seeks to protect women’s rights without stigmatizing entire communities.  

**In conclusion,** immigration has posed some *localized challenges* to women’s safety – exemplified by a few high-profile incidents – but the overall impact on women’s security in Europe has been less dramatic than often perceived. Comprehensive studies have not found an immigrant-driven crime wave targeting women. The Cologne attacks did expose genuine problems (from gaps in crowd security to difficulties in integrating young men from different cultures), and they prompted reforms to address those issues ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/07/07/why-stricter-sexual-assault-laws-in-germany-make-refugee-activists-uneasy/#:~:text=BERLIN%C2%A0%E2%80%94%20After%C2%A0mass%20sexual%20assaults%20in,related%20offenses)). Yet, on the whole, Europe’s women face the same fundamental threats they always have: domestic abuse, sexual harassment, and violence from men **of all backgrounds**. Immigration may have added a new dimension to public fears, but it has *not* fundamentally undermined women’s safety across Europe according to the available evidence ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/higher-proportion-migrants-does-not-mean-more-crime-german-institute-says-2025-02-18/#:~:text=number%20of%20foreigners%20in%20Germany,in%20the%20electoral%20debate%2C%20notably)) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2017/feb/24/trump-fox-news-and-the-truth-about-in-sweden-in-data#:~:text=The%20data%20tells%20us%20that,12%20times%20that%20of%20Sweden)). Ensuring safety for women remains a broad societal challenge – one that involves tackling misogyny and enforcing laws – rather than a problem that can be attributed simply to immigrants. The consensus among experts is that any policies to improve women’s safety must address **violence against women as a whole**, while avoiding scapegoating of migrants, since the data do not support the notion that immigration alone has made Europe’s streets significantly more dangerous for women ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/higher-proportion-migrants-does-not-mean-more-crime-german-institute-says-2025-02-18/#:~:text=number%20of%20foreigners%20in%20Germany,in%20the%20electoral%20debate%2C%20notably)) ([pace.coe.int](https://pace.coe.int/en/files/22437/html#:~:text=Violence%20against%20women%20is%20one,should%20be%20brought%20to%20justice)).
