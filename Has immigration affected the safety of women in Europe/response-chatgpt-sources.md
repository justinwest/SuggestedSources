**Impact of Immigration on Women’s Safety in Europe:**  
Large-scale immigration to Europe – especially since the 2015 migrant crisis – has coincided with notable incidents and trends affecting women’s safety. **Data and reports from several countries suggest that certain immigrant groups are disproportionately involved in crimes against women, including sexual assault and organized exploitation.** At the same time, this topic has often been politically sensitive, leading to underreporting or downplaying of problems by authorities in some cases. Below is an overview of key evidence and perspectives:

- **High-Profile Incidents (Germany’s “Cologne” Attacks):** One of the most publicized events was the wave of sexual assaults on New Year’s Eve 2015–16 in Germany. Around **1,200 women were sexually assaulted across multiple cities (with about 650 cases in Cologne alone), including numerous gropings and several rapes** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_New_Year%27s_Eve_sexual_assaults_in_Germany#:~:text=During%20the%202015%E2%80%932016%20celebrations%20of,sexually%20assaulted%20on%20that%20night)). Victims described the perpetrators as large groups of men of Middle Eastern and North African appearance ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_New_Year%27s_Eve_sexual_assaults_in_Germany#:~:text=women%20were%20in%20public%20spaces%2C,sexually%20assaulted%20on%20that%20night)). Subsequent investigations confirmed that **many suspects were recent immigrants or asylum seekers** who had arrived during the 2015 migrant influx ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_New_Year%27s_Eve_sexual_assaults_in_Germany#:~:text=By%20April%202016%2C%20statistics%20recorded,four%20suspects%20having%20been%20convicted)). For example, of 153 identified Cologne suspects, **two-thirds were from Morocco or Algeria, and nearly half were asylum-seekers** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_New_Year%27s_Eve_sexual_assaults_in_Germany#:~:text=By%20April%202016%2C%20statistics%20recorded,of%20the%20sexual%20assaults%20had)). Police noted that some offenders came from cultures where group sexual harassment (known as *taharrush*) had been reported, and that lack of integration, group dynamics, and attitudes toward women played a role ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_New_Year%27s_Eve_sexual_assaults_in_Germany#:~:text=2016%2C%20the%20German%20government%20and,pressure%2C%20absence%20of%20police%20intervention)) ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_New_Year%27s_Eve_sexual_assaults_in_Germany#:~:text=By%20April%202016%2C%20statistics%20recorded,four%20suspects%20having%20been%20convicted)). These New Year’s Eve attacks shocked the public and **raised awareness that an influx of young male migrants from certain regions could pose challenges for women’s safety**. They also spurred debates on how to better vet newcomers and enforce laws, as initial police response and media coverage were criticized for being too slow or politically cautious.

- **Organized “Grooming Gangs” in the UK:** In Britain, a series of scandals emerged regarding *group-based sexual exploitation* of underage girls by networks of men often of South Asian (predominantly Pakistani Muslim) heritage. **Over the past two decades, thousands of girls – some as young as 11 – were groomed, raped, and trafficked in towns like Rotherham, Rochdale, and Telford**. An official audit in 2025 led by Baroness Louise Casey confirms that **“clear evidence” shows Pakistani-heritage men have been over-represented among suspects in these grooming gangs** ([www.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/baroness-caseys-audit-of-group-based-child-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse#:~:text=But%20on%20the%20key%20issues,racist%20or%20raising%20community%20tensions%E2%80%9D)). For years, local authorities and police **failed to protect the victims, partly due to “institutional blindness” and fears of being accused of racism** ([www.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/baroness-caseys-audit-of-group-based-child-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse#:~:text=being%20raised%20going%20back%20very,racist%20or%20raising%20community%20tensions%E2%80%9D)) ([www.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/baroness-caseys-audit-of-group-based-child-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse#:~:text=But%20most%20disturbing%20of%20all%2C,these%20findings%20are%20not%20new)). In some cases, officials downplayed or even covered up the abuse to avoid inflaming ethnic tensions ([www.stevesailer.net](https://www.stevesailer.net/p/the-british-grooming-gangs-scandal#:~:text=European%20commoners.%20%E2%80%A6%20,)) ([www.stevesailer.net](https://www.stevesailer.net/p/the-british-grooming-gangs-scandal#:~:text=worked%3A%20Noticing%20patterns%20is%20now,)). This meant that **immigrant communities’ crimes against vulnerable English girls went unchecked for years**, dramatically compromising the safety of young women. Only in the mid-2010s did major inquiries (e.g. the 2014 Jay Report on Rotherham) bring these crimes to light. Senior politicians have since acknowledged a “specific problem which involves Pakistani-heritage men… who target vulnerable young white girls” ([www.stevesailer.net](https://www.stevesailer.net/p/the-british-grooming-gangs-scandal#:~:text=,)). The Casey audit calls it “a stain on our society” and has led to new government commitments for policing and mandatory reporting to prevent such abuse ([www.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/baroness-caseys-audit-of-group-based-child-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse#:~:text=Mr%20Speaker%2C%20with%20your%20permission%2C,crimes%20with%20support%20and%20justice)) ([www.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/baroness-caseys-audit-of-group-based-child-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse#:~:text=Because%20we%20cannot%20afford%20more,years%20so%20we%20will%20introduce)). Some commentators have dubbed the grooming gang cover-up **“the scandal of the century,”** given the scale of harm and the length of official inaction [1]. This saga underscores that **poor integration and misguided cultural sensitivity allowed immigrant-perpetrated abuse to terrorize many girls** in the UK.

- **Crime Patterns in Scandinavia (Sweden’s Experience):** Sweden’s generous refugee policies made it a “humanitarian superpower” in the 2010s, but **the country has struggled with rising violent crime – including sexual offenses – linked by many to immigrant integration failures** ([www.politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/sweden-bombings-grenade-attacks-violent-reality-undoing-peaceful-self-image-law-and-order/?ref=quillette.com#:~:text=Gang,riots%2C%20is%20a%20recurring%20phenomenon)) ([www.politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/sweden-bombings-grenade-attacks-violent-reality-undoing-peaceful-self-image-law-and-order/?ref=quillette.com#:~:text=Since%20crime%20is%20intimately%20linked,resulted%20in%20some%20impressive%20contortions)). Notably, a peer-reviewed study of **21 years of rape convictions in Sweden found that **around 63% of those convicted of rape or attempted rape had an immigrant background** (first- or second-generation) ([inquisitivebird.xyz](https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/swedens-immigration-taboo?s=08#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20a%20study%20was,some%20unwanted%20and%20unexpected%20attention)) ([www.nettavisen.no](https://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/forskere-63-prosent-av-voldtektsdomte-i-sverige-har-innvandrerbakgrunn/s/5-95-2234735#:~:text=Men%20n%C3%A5%20viser%20en%20fersk,63%20prosent%20av%20alle%20voldtektsd%C3%B8mte)). This overrepresentation remains even after adjusting for age and socioeconomic factors, suggesting cultural factors are significant ([www.nettavisen.no](https://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/forskere-63-prosent-av-voldtektsdomte-i-sverige-har-innvandrerbakgrunn/s/5-95-2234735#:~:text=Studien%20mener%20at%20sosio%C3%B8konomiske%20%C3%A5rsaker,lovbrudd%20ikke%20n%C3%B8dvendigvis%20er%20avgj%C3%B8rende)). For example, **men who migrated as teenagers (over age 15) were **over six times more likely to be convicted of rape than native Swedish men** ([www.nettavisen.no](https://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/forskere-63-prosent-av-voldtektsdomte-i-sverige-har-innvandrerbakgrunn/s/5-95-2234735#:~:text=hovedforfatteren%20av%20studien%2C%20sier%20f%C3%B8lgende,til%20den%20svenske%20avisen)). Criminologists note that norms around women’s freedom and dress differ markedly in some migrants’ countries of origin – and **misconceptions or misogynistic attitudes have led to tragic outcomes in Sweden** ([www.nettavisen.no](https://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/forskere-63-prosent-av-voldtektsdomte-i-sverige-har-innvandrerbakgrunn/s/5-95-2234735#:~:text=Mye%20er%20kulturelt%20basert%20p%C3%A5,hvor%20man%20kommer%20fra)). At the same time, discussing these issues was long taboo in Swedish academia and media. Researchers who highlighted immigrants’ share of sexual crime faced intense backlash and even official inquiries for being “politically insensitive” ([inquisitivebird.xyz](https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/swedens-immigration-taboo?s=08#:~:text=What%20was%20the%20issue%3F%20The,In%20the%20complaint%20she%20wrote)) ([inquisitivebird.xyz](https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/swedens-immigration-taboo?s=08#:~:text=%C3%96nep%20,one%20of%20the%20critiques%20of)). According to data analysts, Sweden until recently **avoided collecting or publishing detailed crime statistics by ethnicity or country of origin**, in contrast to neighboring Denmark ([inquisitivebird.xyz](https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/swedens-immigration-taboo?s=08#:~:text=While%20immigration%20is%20widely%20considered,even%20more%20relevant%20public%20matter)) ([inquisitivebird.xyz](https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/swedens-immigration-taboo?s=08#:~:text=The%20difference%20between%20Denmark%20and,relevant%20facts)). This reluctance was driven by fear of stigmatizing minorities, but critics argue it impeded honest discussion of women’s safety. By 2018, however, the effects were hard to ignore: **Sweden’s rate of deadly violence climbed above the Western European average due to gang shootings “mainly among men with immigrant backgrounds,”** and the government conceded that reported rapes had actually been rising (despite a minister’s false claims that they were falling) ([www.politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/sweden-bombings-grenade-attacks-violent-reality-undoing-peaceful-self-image-law-and-order/?ref=quillette.com#:~:text=Gang,riots%2C%20is%20a%20recurring%20phenomenon)) ([www.politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/sweden-bombings-grenade-attacks-violent-reality-undoing-peaceful-self-image-law-and-order/?ref=quillette.com#:~:text=they%20mean%20it,resulted%20in%20some%20impressive%20contortions)). In short, **Sweden’s experience suggests that large-scale immigration from societies with very different gender norms can, without effective integration, contribute to higher risks for women**, from harassment in public spaces to rape and gang violence.

- **Everyday Harassment and Community Impacts:** Beyond the headline-grabbing cases, there have been many **localized incidents across Europe linking migrant men to sexual harassment or assault**. In Germany, for instance, **public swimming pools have seen recurring problems with groups of young migrant-background men harassing women and girls** ([www.eugyppius.com](https://www.eugyppius.com/p/migrants-will-not-stop-molesting#:~:text=dubious%20privilege%20of%20discovering%20whole,children%20crime)) ([www.eugyppius.com](https://www.eugyppius.com/p/migrants-will-not-stop-molesting#:~:text=origins,her%20with%20a%20bloody%20nose)). A particularly egregious case occurred in June 2025 in Gelnhausen, Hesse, where a **group of Syrian asylum-seekers (ages 18–28) molested eight or nine underage girls (11–17 years old) at a pool** ([www.eugyppius.com](https://www.eugyppius.com/p/migrants-will-not-stop-molesting#:~:text=Stories%20like%20this%20often%20come,%E2%80%9D)) ([www.spiegel.de](https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/gelnhausen-polizei-untersucht-belaestigung-von-neun-maedchen-in-hessischem-freibad-a-81d9b81e-4874-46e1-87b6-2341d9d6bdc6#:~:text=Nach%20mutma%C3%9Flichen%20sexuellen%20Bel%C3%A4stigungen%20in,Sprechers%20sind%20die%20Tatverd%C3%A4chtigen%20Syrer)). Police arrested four Syrian suspects and noted similar group offenses in other towns ([www.spiegel.de](https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/gelnhausen-polizei-untersucht-belaestigung-von-neun-maedchen-in-hessischem-freibad-a-81d9b81e-4874-46e1-87b6-2341d9d6bdc6#:~:text=Nach%20mutma%C3%9Flichen%20sexuellen%20Bel%C3%A4stigungen%20in,Sprechers%20sind%20die%20Tatverd%C3%A4chtigen%20Syrer)) ([www.spiegel.de](https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/gelnhausen-polizei-untersucht-belaestigung-von-neun-maedchen-in-hessischem-freibad-a-81d9b81e-4874-46e1-87b6-2341d9d6bdc6#:~:text=sind%20die%20Tatverd%C3%A4chtigen%20Syrer)). Such incidents, though not as large in scale as Cologne’s New Year’s Eve, reinforce perceptions that **certain public places have become less safe for women due to some migrants’ behavior**. Authorities have sometimes responded with increased security or awareness campaigns – though critics highlight bizarre “politically correct” public messaging that avoids mentioning migrant perpetrators. For example, in Cologne an anti-groping poster campaign depicted blonde German boys as offenders and veiled girls as victims, seemingly **contrary to the actual demographics of recent pool molestation cases** ([www.eugyppius.com](https://www.eugyppius.com/p/migrants-will-not-stop-molesting#:~:text=is%20remind%20everybody%20that%20groping,ethnicities%20of%20perpetrator%20and%20victim)) ([www.eugyppius.com](https://www.eugyppius.com/p/migrants-will-not-stop-molesting#:~:text=Aside%20from%20other%20obvious%20objections%2C,schoolmarmish%20clarification%20to%20iron%20out)). Observers like journalist Eugyppius argue that **European officials, hesitant to stigmatize immigrants, often downplay these problems** even as *“everyone knows it’s happening”* ([www.eugyppius.com](https://www.eugyppius.com/p/migrants-will-not-stop-molesting#:~:text=would%20never%20go%20again%2C%20and,messaging%20from%20our%20progressive%20establishment)) ([www.eugyppius.com](https://www.eugyppius.com/p/migrants-will-not-stop-molesting#:~:text=Aside%20from%20other%20obvious%20objections%2C,schoolmarmish%20clarification%20to%20iron%20out)). This disconnect can erode trust: women may feel authorities won’t acknowledge real threats, leading some to alter their behavior (avoiding certain areas, crowds, or facilities) for safety. 

- **East–West Divide in Perceptions:** It’s important to note that **not all of Europe has experienced these issues equally**, partly due to differing immigration policies. Countries in **Eastern Europe (e.g. Poland, Hungary)** admitted very few refugees from the Middle East/Africa and report far fewer incidents of the kind seen in Germany or Sweden. Their leaders often cite Western Europe’s problems as vindication for their restrictive stance. A Deutsche Welle commentary described this dynamic as *“Eastern promise and Western pretension”* – suggesting Eastern Europeans promise to protect their society (including women) by keeping out what they see as risky immigration, while Western Europeans once prided themselves on liberal openness but then struggled with the consequences [2]. Indeed, after the Cologne attacks, politicians in Eastern Europe pointed to them as a **warning**, arguing that **women’s rights and public safety could be undermined by mass immigration from societies with different gender norms**. This East–West divide reflects differing values and experiences: Western nations emphasize multicultural inclusion (and many immigrant men in those countries are **law-abiding**, integrating well), whereas Eastern nations prioritize homogeneity and may view *any* added risk to women as unacceptable. The contrast in outcomes – e.g. *no Cologne-type mass assaults in Warsaw or Budapest* – will likely continue to inform Europe’s debates on migration.

**Conclusion:** Overall, immigration **has affected the safety of women in parts of Europe**, as evidenced by statistical overrepresentations of immigrant-background perpetrators in sexual and gender-based crimes and several devastating incidents. The arrival of large numbers of young men from regions with more patriarchal cultures **introduced challenges that European authorities were often slow to address** – from street harassment and pool assaults to organized abuse rings. It would be inaccurate to say *all* immigrant men pose a threat – **the vast majority do not commit crimes**, and natives also perpetrate violence against women. However, the *relative* impact has been significant in specific contexts. European governments are now grappling with how to **balance immigration with integration, law enforcement, and frank public dialogue** to ensure women (and all citizens) feel safe. The lessons learned – painful as they are – have prompted reforms: better screening and education for newcomers, harsher penalties for sexual crimes, mandatory reporting laws in the UK, and more transparent crime data. In sum, **the experience of the last decade shows that unmanaged immigration surges, paired with cultural gaps and policy hesitance, did lead to real safety risks for women – a reality Europe is now coming to terms with** ([www.politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/sweden-bombings-grenade-attacks-violent-reality-undoing-peaceful-self-image-law-and-order/?ref=quillette.com#:~:text=they%20mean%20it,resulted%20in%20some%20impressive%20contortions)) ([www.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/baroness-caseys-audit-of-group-based-child-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse#:~:text=being%20raised%20going%20back%20very,racist%20or%20raising%20community%20tensions%E2%80%9D)).
