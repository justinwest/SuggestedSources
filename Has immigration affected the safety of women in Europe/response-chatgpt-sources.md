**Increases in Sexual Assault Incidents:** Several European countries have seen high-profile sexual crimes linked to recent immigrant populations, suggesting an impact on women’s safety. During the 2015–16 New Year’s Eve celebrations in Germany, for example, about 1,200 women reported being sexually assaulted in public spaces by large groups of men described by officials as of North African or Arab origin ([en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_New_Year%27s_Eve_sexual_assaults_in_Germany#:~:text=During%20the%202015%E2%80%932016%20celebrations%20of,1)). This unprecedented mass harassment – notably in Cologne – shocked the public and underscored how an influx of young male migrants from different cultural backgrounds could lead to new threats for women. In the ensuing years, there have been recurring reports in Germany of sexual harassment at public swimming pools and similar venues, often involving migrant men. One particularly **notorious incident** occurred in Gelnhausen, where a group of Syrian asylum-seekers (aged 18–28) molested eight or nine underage girls at a local pool ([www.eugyppius.com](https://www.eugyppius.com/p/migrants-will-not-stop-molesting#:~:text=Stories%20like%20this%20often%20come,first%20complained%20about%20what%20was)). Such cases, amplified by media coverage, have contributed to a *perception* that women face increased risks in public due to some newcomers’ behavior.

**Grooming Gangs and Organized Exploitation:** In the United Kingdom, a series of “grooming gang” scandals has highlighted the targeting of vulnerable girls by men from certain immigrant communities. Investigations in towns like Rotherham, Rochdale, and others revealed that **hundreds** of underage girls – many as young as early teens – were systematically raped, trafficked, and abused over years ([www.bbc.co.uk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy4ynzppk80o#:~:text=The%20report%20found%20at%20least,in%20the%20South%20Yorkshire%20town)). The Rotherham inquiry (Jay Report, 2014) estimated at least 1,400 girls were abused from 1997–2013, predominantly by men of Pakistani heritage ([www.bbc.co.uk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy4ynzppk80o#:~:text=The%20report%20found%20at%20least,in%20the%20South%20Yorkshire%20town)). This pattern of group-based exploitation, often involving men of South Asian Muslim background and mostly white British victims, has been described as *“one of the most horrific crimes”* and a national disgrace. A recent government-commissioned audit (the Casey Review, 2025) confirmed a clear **over-representation** of Pakistani-heritage suspects in these grooming crimes ([hansard.parliament.uk](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2025-06-18/debates/162ECFA1-D925-45CF-A73A-78D5C0A5BDC6/ChildSexualExploitationCaseyReport#:~:text=On%20the%20key%20issues%20of,Baroness%20Casey%20refers%20to)). Perhaps even more troubling, the audit found that authorities repeatedly failed to protect the victims – in part due to **fears of being labeled racist** if they drew attention to the ethnic aspect of the abuse ([hansard.parliament.uk](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2025-06-18/debates/162ECFA1-D925-45CF-A73A-78D5C0A5BDC6/ChildSexualExploitationCaseyReport#:~:text=being%20raised%20going%20back%20many,Baroness%20Casey%20refers%20to)). Commentators have dubbed the grooming gang saga *“the scandal of the century”*, arguing that political correctness enabled abusers to prey on girls with impunity for far too long [1]. In response, UK officials are now mandating collection of data on perpetrators’ ethnicity/nationality and launching new investigations into past negligence ([victimscommissioner.org.uk](https://victimscommissioner.org.uk/news/statement-on-baroness-caseys-audit-of-group-based-child-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse/#:~:text=Casey%E2%80%99s%20report%20details%20how%20young,sex%2C%20using%20violence%20and%20coercion)) ([hansard.parliament.uk](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2025-06-18/debates/162ECFA1-D925-45CF-A73A-78D5C0A5BDC6/ChildSexualExploitationCaseyReport#:~:text=On%20the%20key%20issues%20of,Baroness%20Casey%20refers%20to)).

**Crime Statistics and Immigrant Overrepresentation:** Beyond headline-grabbing incidents, data from several countries indicate that certain immigrant groups are disproportionately represented among perpetrators of sexual and violent crimes affecting women. In **Sweden**, which has taken in large numbers of migrants over recent decades, reported sexual offenses have risen significantly since the early 2000s ([inquisitivebird.xyz](https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/immigration-and-crime-sweden#:~:text=Sweden%20also%20has%20one%20of,offenses%20over%20the%20last%20decade)). While higher reporting rates and broader legal definitions partly explain Sweden’s high rape statistics, surveys suggest actual victimization of women has **increased** in the past decade ([inquisitivebird.xyz](https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/immigration-and-crime-sweden#:~:text=Sweden%20also%20has%20one%20of,offenses%20over%20the%20last%20decade)). Notably, a comprehensive Swedish study found that **63% of individuals convicted of rape** were of immigrant (first- or second-generation) background ([inquisitivebird.xyz](https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/swedens-immigration-taboo?s=08#:~:text=What%20was%20the%20issue%3F%20The,In%20the%20complaint%20she%20wrote)). This is striking given that foreign-born residents and their children constituted a smaller fraction of the population (about 35% by 2023) ([inquisitivebird.xyz](https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/immigration-and-crime-sweden#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20immigrants%20in,immigration%20and%20crime%20has%20shifted)). The study’s finding – that a majority of rape convicts were immigrants – generated controversy in Sweden; a graduate student even filed an ethics complaint to halt the researchers from highlighting immigrants’ overrepresentation ([inquisitivebird.xyz](https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/swedens-immigration-taboo?s=08#:~:text=What%20was%20the%20issue%3F%20The,In%20the%20complaint%20she%20wrote)). Similarly, in Germany, official reports during the mid-2010s noted that non-Germans (including recent refugees) accounted for a higher-than-average share of sexual offense suspects relative to their population share [2]. These statistics reinforce the pattern that *certain* immigrant demographics (often young males from patriarchal societies or conflict regions) are **disproportionately involved** in crimes threatening women’s safety ([inquisitivebird.xyz](https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/swedens-immigration-taboo?s=08#:~:text=What%20was%20the%20issue%3F%20The,In%20the%20complaint%20she%20wrote)) ([en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_New_Year%27s_Eve_sexual_assaults_in_Germany#:~:text=During%20the%202015%E2%80%932016%20celebrations%20of,1)).

**Broader Crime and Security Trends:** Large-scale immigration has also coincided with broader shifts in public safety throughout Europe. **Sweden**, long seen as one of Europe’s safest societies, has experienced a surge in violent gang crime that erodes the general sense of security ([www.politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/sweden-bombings-grenade-attacks-violent-reality-undoing-peaceful-self-image-law-and-order/?ref=quillette.com#:~:text=,spectacular%20or%20lead%20to%20fatalities)). Bombings, shootings, and organized crime hits – frequently linked to **male gang members of immigrant origin** – have become increasingly common in Swedish cities ([www.politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/sweden-bombings-grenade-attacks-violent-reality-undoing-peaceful-self-image-law-and-order/?ref=quillette.com#:~:text=,spectacular%20or%20lead%20to%20fatalities)). For instance, gun homicides (often gang-related) climbed tenfold from the 1990s to recent years, and officials acknowledge that these deadly shootings are mainly carried out by men with immigrant backgrounds in segregated “parallel societies” ([www.politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/sweden-bombings-grenade-attacks-violent-reality-undoing-peaceful-self-image-law-and-order/?ref=quillette.com#:~:text=Gang,even%20riots%2C%20is%20a%20recurring)). While these gang conflicts primarily involve male perpetrators and victims, the spillover violence (explosions, stray bullets, etc.) endangers the public at large, including women. In other countries too, heightened **social unrest** in some migrant-dense neighborhoods – from car burnings to clashes with police – has contributed to an atmosphere where women may feel less safe moving about, even if they are not the direct targets [3]. In summary, immigration-fueled challenges to law and order range from sexual offenses to street violence, all of which can affect women’s sense of safety in their communities.

**Challenges in Acknowledging the Problem:** It is important to note that discussing immigration’s impact on women’s safety has often been politically sensitive. Authorities and media in Western Europe initially hesitated to draw links between migrants and crimes against women. In **Sweden**, there has been a well-documented reluctance to release crime statistics broken down by ethnicity or migrant status, with such debates considered taboo ([www.politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/sweden-bombings-grenade-attacks-violent-reality-undoing-peaceful-self-image-law-and-order/?ref=quillette.com#:~:text=long%20renowned%20for%20its%20safety%2C,the%20general%20election%20in%20September)). The Swedish police even faced criticism for downplaying incidents (for example, sexual assaults by migrant youth at a 2014 Stockholm music festival were reportedly covered up to avoid stigmatizing immigrants). Likewise, the UK’s grooming gang scandals festered partly because local officials were **“in denial”** and afraid of accusations of bigotry ([hansard.parliament.uk](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2025-06-18/debates/162ECFA1-D925-45CF-A73A-78D5C0A5BDC6/ChildSexualExploitationCaseyReport#:~:text=being%20raised%20going%20back%20many,Baroness%20Casey%20refers%20to)). This hesitancy delayed frank discussion of the risks and delayed justice for victims ([hansard.parliament.uk](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2025-06-18/debates/162ECFA1-D925-45CF-A73A-78D5C0A5BDC6/ChildSexualExploitationCaseyReport#:~:text=being%20raised%20going%20back%20many,Baroness%20Casey%20refers%20to)). Only in recent years has the political climate shifted. Public outrage and high-profile cases have compelled governments to acknowledge that *cultural integration and criminal behavior* are linked in some instances. Many countries are now collecting better data on offenders’ backgrounds and tightening policies (e.g. more rigorous asylum vetting and deportation of foreign criminals) in an effort to restore public confidence in safety [4].

**Conclusion:** In conclusion, immigration **has affected the safety of women in Europe**, although the extent varies by country and community. The arrival of large numbers of young men from regions with different gender norms has in some places led to **increased incidents of sexual harassment, assault, and exploitation targeting women** ([en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_New_Year%27s_Eve_sexual_assaults_in_Germany#:~:text=During%20the%202015%E2%80%932016%20celebrations%20of,1)) ([www.bbc.co.uk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy4ynzppk80o#:~:text=The%20report%20found%20at%20least,in%20the%20South%20Yorkshire%20town)). High-profile examples – from the orchestrated mass assaults in Cologne and other cities, to organized grooming rings in English towns – underscore a real impact on victims and public perception. Statistical studies further indicate that immigrants (or their sons) are over-represented among perpetrators of certain violent and sexual crimes ([inquisitivebird.xyz](https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/swedens-immigration-taboo?s=08#:~:text=What%20was%20the%20issue%3F%20The,In%20the%20complaint%20she%20wrote)). It would be inaccurate to **blanket-blame** all immigrants for these problems – the vast majority are law-abiding, and native-born Europeans also commit violence against women. However, the evidence shows that specific *immigrant-linked crime issues* have undermined women’s security in parts of Europe. A combination of policy failures and cultural frictions allowed these threats to grow, thereby diminishing the **overall safety of women** in affected areas. European authorities today are coming to grips with this reality, attempting to balance compassion for immigrants with the imperative to protect women and uphold the rule of law ([victimscommissioner.org.uk](https://victimscommissioner.org.uk/news/statement-on-baroness-caseys-audit-of-group-based-child-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse/#:~:text=Casey%E2%80%99s%20report%20details%20how%20young,sex%2C%20using%20violence%20and%20coercion)) ([www.politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/sweden-bombings-grenade-attacks-violent-reality-undoing-peaceful-self-image-law-and-order/?ref=quillette.com#:~:text=long%20renowned%20for%20its%20safety%2C,the%20general%20election%20in%20September)).
