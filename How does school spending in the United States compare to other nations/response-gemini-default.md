# How does school spending in the United States compare to other nations?

Based on data from leading international organizations like the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), school spending in the United States is among the highest in the world. However, a simple comparison of a single number can be misleading. A comprehensive understanding requires examining spending from multiple angles, including the level of education, the source of funds, and the relationship between spending and student outcomes.

### 1. Overall Spending Per Student

When measured on a per-student basis, the United States consistently ranks near the top among developed nations.

*   **Combined Primary to Tertiary Education:** The U.S. spends significantly more per student across all levels of education (from primary school through college) than the OECD average. In the OECD's 2023 "Education at a Glance" report (using 2020 data), the U.S. spent $17,065 per student annually across all levels, compared to the OECD average of $11,766.
*   **High-Spending Peers:** While high, the U.S. is not always number one. Countries like Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Norway often have higher per-student expenditures, partly due to very high national costs of living and teacher salaries.

### 2. Spending by Educational Level

The breakdown by level reveals a more nuanced picture, particularly in higher education.

*   **Primary and Secondary Education (K-12):** U.S. spending on K-12 education is very high. It spends approximately $15,500 per student in primary and secondary education, well above the OECD average of about $10,900. This places the U.S. firmly in the top tier of spenders for K-12 education.
*   **Tertiary Education (Higher Education):** This is where the United States is a significant outlier. The U.S. spends over $37,000 per student in tertiary education, more than double the OECD average of roughly $17,900. This exceptionally high figure makes the U.S. one of the world's top spenders on higher education, driven by high tuition costs at both public and private institutions.

### 3. Spending as a Percentage of GDP

Another common metric is the proportion of a country's economic output (Gross Domestic Product) dedicated to educational institutions.

*   On this measure, the U.S. is also above average. It spends **6.0% of its GDP** on education from primary to tertiary levels, compared to the OECD average of **5.1%**.
*   This high percentage is heavily influenced by the massive investment in tertiary education. While U.S. spending on K-12 education is about average as a share of GDP, its spending on higher education is nearly double the OECD average.

### 4. Source of Funds: Public vs. Private

The source of education funding is a critical point of differentiation between the U.S. and many other nations.

*   **K-12 Education:** In the U.S., K-12 education is overwhelmingly funded by public sources (local, state, and federal governments), which is similar to the model in most other OECD countries.
*   **Higher Education:** In contrast, a significantly larger share of higher education funding in the U.S. comes from **private sources**. Private funding (primarily from student tuition and fees) accounts for about two-thirds of the total spending on tertiary education in the U.S. This is a stark contrast to the OECD average, where public funding still makes up the majority of higher education spending. In many European countries, higher education is largely or entirely state-funded.

### 5. The Spending vs. Outcomes Paradox

The most critical aspect of this comparison is the relationship between high spending and student performance. Despite being one of the highest-spending countries, the U.S. achieves only average results on international assessments.

*   **PISA Scores:** On the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which tests 15-year-olds in reading, math, and science, U.S. students consistently score at or near the OECD average, and well below top-performing nations like Japan, South Korea, Estonia, and Finland—many of which spend less per student.

This disconnect is often attributed to several key factors unique to the U.S. system:

1.  **Inequitable Distribution of Funding:** The *national average* spending figure in the U.S. masks extreme internal disparities. Because school funding is heavily reliant on local property taxes, wealthy districts often spend two to three times more per student than poor districts. This means that while some U.S. students attend schools funded at world-leading levels, millions of others attend schools funded far below the national average. Many other developed nations have more centralized funding systems that ensure greater equity between schools.

2.  **How Money is Spent:** It's not just about *how much* is spent, but *how*. Compared to other countries, a smaller portion of the U.S. education budget goes directly to teacher salaries. A larger share is allocated to non-teaching staff, administration, and extensive ancillary services such as student transportation, food services, counseling, and comprehensive special education programs, which are often more extensive in the U.S. than in other nations.

3.  **Societal Factors:** The U.S. has a higher rate of child poverty than most other OECD countries. Schools in high-poverty areas must spend significant resources on addressing non-educational needs (like health, nutrition, and safety) before effective learning can happen, which can dilute the impact of educational spending.

### Summary

In conclusion, the United States is a top-tier country for education spending, both on a per-student basis and as a percentage of its GDP. This is particularly true for higher education, which is heavily funded by private tuition. However, this high level of investment does not translate into correspondingly high student performance on international tests. The primary reasons for this gap between spending and outcomes are the profound inequity in how funds are distributed within the country and the complex allocation of resources to non-instructional and societal support roles.
