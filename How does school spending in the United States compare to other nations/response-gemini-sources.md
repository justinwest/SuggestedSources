# How does school spending in the United States compare to other nations?

Based on the provided sources, a comparison of school spending in the United States to other nations reveals different perspectives depending on the metrics used. While the U.S. spends more per student in absolute terms than most other developed countries, some analyses argue this comparison is misleading.

In terms of direct per-pupil spending, the United States ranks among the highest in the world. According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), U.S. expenditures per student are significantly higher than the average for other developed nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) [1]. Author Freddie deBoer reinforces this point, stating that "America is a world leader in per-pupil K-12 education spending" and that the high level of funding is a "brute fact" [4].

However, the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) argues that these absolute spending figures are an "oversimplification" [2]. The EPI presents a different perspective by measuring spending relative to national wealth. By this metric, U.S. spending on elementary and secondary education as a percentage of its gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is actually below the average of other OECD countries [2]. The EPI also notes that U.S. per-pupil spending figures include significant non-instructional costs, such as student transportation and nutrition. In many other countries, these services are funded by other government agencies and are not counted as education expenditures, making direct comparisons difficult [2].

Freddie deBoer directly challenges the EPI's perspective, calling the argument about spending as a percentage of GDP a "shell game" [4]. He contends that because the U.S. is a much wealthier country than most of its peers, it can devote a smaller share of its national wealth to education and still spend more in real, absolute terms per student. From this viewpoint, the high absolute spending figure is the most relevant and important fact, regardless of its proportion of the nation's total wealth [4].

2.  The Economic Policy Institute argues that simple per-pupil spending comparisons are misleading. It contends that the U.S. spends less as a percentage of its national wealth than many peer nations and that U.S. figures include non-instructional costs that are categorized differently in other countries, thus complicating direct comparisons.

4.  This author argues that the United States is unequivocally a high-spending nation on K-12 education in absolute terms. He views arguments that attempt to downplay this fact, such as by comparing spending as a percentage of GDP, as misleading and obscuring the reality of high U.S. investment in education.
