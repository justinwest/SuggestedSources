# How does school spending in the United States compare to other nations?

The United States spends significantly more on primary and secondary education per student than most other developed nations [1, 2]. However, this high national average masks vast spending disparities between states and is influenced by socioeconomic factors unique to the U.S., making direct international comparisons complex [4].

### Spending in Dollars and as a Percentage of GDP

According to 2020 data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United States spent $15,500 per full-time equivalent (FTE) student on elementary and secondary education. This figure is substantially higher than the OECD average of $11,000 [2].

When viewed as a percentage of its gross domestic product (GDP), the U.S. also allocates a larger share to education than its peers. In 2019, the U.S. spent 4.9% of its GDP on elementary and secondary education, compared to an OECD average of 3.5% [1]. While the U.S. is among the highest-spending countries, it is not always number one; nations like Luxembourg, Norway, and Austria have at times reported higher per-student expenditures [1].

### Nuances and Criticisms of Direct Comparisons

While the aggregate data shows high U.S. spending, several factors complicate simple comparisons to other countries:

*   **State-Level Disparities**: The national average in the U.S. conceals major differences in spending between states. For example, in 2019, per-pupil spending in New York was more than double that of states like Arizona and Idaho. The Economic Policy Institute argues that high-spending states like Massachusetts and New Jersey are more comparable to high-achieving, high-spending countries like Finland, while low-spending U.S. states have spending levels and outcomes that are far lower [4].
*   **Socioeconomic Factors**: The United States has a higher rate of child poverty than most other OECD nations. Schools in the U.S., particularly in high-poverty areas, must allocate more resources to services that are not directly instructional, such as providing meals, health services, and support for English language learners and students with disabilities. These costs are included in per-pupil spending figures, making U.S. spending appear higher without necessarily translating into better academic outcomes on standardized tests [4].
*   **Misleading Narratives**: Some commentators argue that the simple talking point that "the U.S. spends more and gets less" is often used to support ideological arguments, such as pushing for privatization or claiming that funding levels are irrelevant to school quality [5]. While the U.S. scores are around the OECD average in reading and science and below average in mathematics [3], analysts caution against drawing a direct line from spending to these scores without accounting for the diverse challenges and functions of the American public school system [4, 5].

In summary, while the United States is a high-spending nation on K-12 education compared to international peers, a comprehensive understanding requires looking beyond national averages to consider the vast internal disparities and the additional societal responsibilities placed on its public schools [1, 4].

    *   This article offers a critique of how education data is interpreted and presented. The author argues that simplistic comparisons of U.S. spending and test scores are often used to advance a political ideology that dismisses the importance of school funding.
