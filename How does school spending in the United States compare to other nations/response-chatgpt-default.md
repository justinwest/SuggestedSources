# How does school spending in the United States compare to other nations?

Overview  
Measured by either raw dollars, expenditure per student, or as a share of national income, the United States is one of the world’s highest spenders on education. At the same time, the composition of that spending (public vs. private), its distribution across age groups, and the academic returns Americans obtain from it differ markedly from most peer nations.

1. What is being compared  
• Per-student spending in purchasing-power-parity (PPP) dollars is the standard yardstick used by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and UNESCO.  
• Spending can also be expressed as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) or as a share of total government expenditure.  
• Figures cited below come primarily from OECD “Education at a Glance 2023,” the latest National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data for the 2021–22 fiscal year, and UNESCO Institute for Statistics.

2. Primary and secondary (K-12) education  
Per-student spending in 2021 (latest comparable year, PPP):  
• United States ≈ $15,600  
• OECD average ≈ $10,200  
• Only a handful of small, very high-income countries—Luxembourg, Norway, Switzerland—regularly exceed U.S. K-12 spending.

Spending as a share of GDP (public + private):  
• United States ≈ 3.5 % (K-12 only)  
• OECD average ≈ 3.0 %

Internal variation  
• U.S. state-to-state spending ranged from roughly $8,000 per student in Utah to over $25,000 in New York in 2021.  
• Local property-tax dependence contributes to the widest intranational funding gaps found in the industrialized world.

3. Tertiary (college and graduate) education  
Per-student spending:  
• United States ≈ $36,400  
• OECD average ≈ $17,800  
The U.S. spends about double the OECD mean and sits at, or near, the top of global rankings every year.

Public–private mix  
• Roughly 64 % of U.S. higher-education outlays come from public sources; 36 % from private sources (mostly tuition).  
• Across the OECD the average private share is only 22 %, and in the EU it is around 13 %.  
• High private contributions help explain both large institutional budgets and high tuition levels.

4. Teacher compensation  
• After 15 years’ experience, a U.S. public-school teacher earns about $67,000, vs. an OECD average of $45,000 (all PPP).  
• However, U.S. teachers work more hours per year—so salary per instructional hour is much closer to the OECD norm.

5. Outcomes and efficiency  
• PISA 2022: U.S. 15-year-olds scored at or slightly above the OECD average in reading and science, slightly below in math, despite above-average spending.  
• College attainment is high (around 48 % of 25-34-year-olds hold an associate degree or higher, vs. 45 % OECD), but the U.S. leads the OECD in student-loan balances.  
Interpretation: higher spending does not translate cleanly into better K-12 achievement, though it is associated with broad college access and a large, research-intensive higher-education sector.

6. Trends  
• Inflation-adjusted K-12 spending rose roughly 28 % in the U.S. between 2000 and 2020, outpacing enrollment growth.  
• Several peer countries (e.g., Canada, Australia, UK) have recently narrowed the gap, especially in early-childhood and vocational programs.  
• Pandemic stimulus temporarily pushed U.S. K-12 spending even higher; federal aid is now winding down, raising questions about future levels.

7. Key takeaways  
• On most fiscal metrics the United States is among the very top education spenders globally, especially once private higher-education dollars are counted.  
• Spending is uneven—by state, by district, and between K-12 and tertiary sectors—resulting in marked disparities.  
• Academic outcomes are middling relative to the size of the investment, suggesting that the efficiency and equity of U.S. spending remain central policy challenges.
