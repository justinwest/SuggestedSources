# How does school spending in the United States compare to other nations?

How U.S. school spending stacks up against the rest of the world  

(Unless otherwise noted, figures come from the OECD’s “Education at a Glance 2023” and are expressed in U.S. dollars adjusted for purchasing-power-parity, or PPP, so they are comparable across countries.)

1. How much does the United States spend?  
   • All education levels combined (pre-K through tertiary) = 6.0 % of U.S. GDP (OECD average ≈ 5.1 %).  
   • Primary and secondary (K-12) = 3.5 % of GDP (OECD average ≈ 3.2 %).  
   • Tertiary = 2.5 % of GDP (OECD average ≈ 1.4 %).

2. Per-student spending (annual, PPP)  
   Primary:  
     – United States ≈ $14,700  
     – OECD average ≈ $9,300  
     – Highest: Luxembourg ≈ $23,200, Switzerland ≈ $19,300  
   Secondary:  
     – United States ≈ $16,200  
     – OECD average ≈ $10,400  
   Tertiary (universities and community colleges, public + private):  
     – United States ≈ $36,600 (highest in the OECD)  
     – OECD average ≈ $17,100  

   In other words, the United States spends roughly 50 – 70 % more per pupil than the OECD mean at the K-12 level and more than twice the average at the college level.

3. Public versus private sources  
   • K-12: 92 % of U.S. spending is public, about the same as the OECD average (90 %).  
   • Tertiary: Only 63 % is public in the United States versus 77 % across the OECD; high tuition and widespread student aid push U.S. private spending far above everyone else’s.

4. Where the United States ranks  
   • K-12 per-pupil outlays: top five among 38 OECD members (usually behind Luxembourg, Switzerland, Norway, Austria).  
   • Tertiary per-student outlays: #1.  
   • Spending as a share of GDP: above average but not the absolute highest—Denmark, Iceland and Norway devote slightly larger GDP shares to education overall.

5. Regional variation inside the United States  
   Because U.S. elementary-secondary funding is driven by state and local governments, spending ranges from ≈ $9,000 per pupil (Mississippi, Utah, Idaho) to ≈ $26,000 (New York, New Jersey, D.C.). Some individual U.S. states out-spend every OECD country; others fall near or even below the OECD median.

6. Outcomes versus outlays  
   • On the latest PISA exams (2018/2022), U.S. 15-year-olds scored close to the OECD average in reading and science and slightly below average in math—despite above-average spending.  
   • This disconnect fuels debates about efficiency, equity, and the large share spent on non-instructional costs (administration, transportation, special services).

7. Bottom line  
   • The United States is one of the world’s biggest spenders on education, especially at the college level.  
   • It spends noticeably more per child in K-12 than most peer nations, although a handful of small, high-income European countries spend even more.  
   • As a share of national income, U.S. spending is high but not uniquely so.  
   • Its spending mix is distinctive: comparatively generous public funding at K-12, but unusually heavy reliance on private money at the university level.
