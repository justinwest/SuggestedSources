# How does school spending in the United States compare to other nations?

U.S. elementary- and secondary-school systems are among the most expensive in the industrialized world when costs are converted to a common currency, although the picture changes a bit when spending is expressed as a share of the nation’s wealth.

1. Spending per pupil in dollars  
   • NCES, drawing on the OECD’s Education at a Glance tables, reports that the United States spent roughly $14,400–$15,000 per student at the K-12 level in 2019 (purchasing-power-parity dollars).  
   • The OECD average was a little over $10,000, so U.S. schools spend about one-third more than the typical industrialized country and are exceeded by only a handful of very small, high-income nations such as Luxembourg or Norway [1].  
   • The 2022 PISA briefing notes that cumulative public spending on a U.S. student between ages 6 and 15 was about $131,000, versus an OECD average of $102,700; only 11 of the 37 OECD countries spent as much or more [3].

2. Spending relative to national income  
   • Because the United States is wealthier than most countries, its high dollar spending translates into a more modest picture when expressed as a share of GDP. Total public spending on K-12 education is a little above the OECD mean (about 3.5 percent of GDP for the United States versus just under 3.3 percent for the OECD), but it is not the highest in the world [1].

3. Large internal variation  
   • The Economic Policy Institute stresses that national averages hide enormous interstate differences: some U.S. states (e.g., New York) spend more per pupil than any OECD country, while others (e.g., Arizona, Idaho) spend at or below the OECD average. Hence, “state‐to‐state comparisons are more revealing for policy than country‐to‐country ones” [2].

4. Spending versus results  
   • Despite its high per-student outlays, the United States posts only middling achievement on international tests such as PISA 2022 (around the OECD average in reading and science and below average in mathematics) [3].  
   • Commentator Freddie deBoer argues that these figures undercut claims that lack of money is the principal cause of U.S. performance problems, because “we already spend more than almost everyone else” [4].

In sum, U.S. K-12 schools spend substantially more per pupil than those of most other wealthy nations and slightly more of their national income than the OECD average, yet this spending coexists with average academic outcomes and wide inequalities across states.
