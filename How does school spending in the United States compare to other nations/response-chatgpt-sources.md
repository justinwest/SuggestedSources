# How does school spending in the United States compare to other nations?

How much does the United States spend on schools?

1. Per-student spending  
   • Elementary and secondary level (K–12).  According to OECD data compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), U.S. public and private schools spent about $17,000 per full-time-equivalent (FTE) student in 2020, roughly one-third more than the OECD average of about $12,000. Only a handful of very small or very high-income countries—e.g., Luxembourg and Norway—spend more per pupil than the United States [1][2].  
   • Tertiary (college and university).  U.S. spending per FTE student at the higher-education level exceeded $35,000 in 2020, roughly double the OECD average, again placing the United States near the top of international rankings [2].  

2. Spending as a share of national output  
   When education outlays are expressed as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the United States also sits above the OECD mean, but by a smaller margin.  In 2020 the United States devoted about 5.1 percent of GDP to educational institutions from pre-primary through tertiary, compared with the OECD average of 4.4 percent.  Several Nordic countries (Iceland, Norway, Sweden) and Israel spent comparable or larger shares [1].  

3. What the money is spent on  
   • Instruction vs. support services.  Roughly 65 percent of U.S. K–12 expenditures go to instruction, with the remainder paying for transportation, food services, and other support activities—a larger non-instructional share than is typical in many OECD countries [1].  
   • Public vs. private sources.  The U.S. relies more heavily on private funding at the post-secondary level (tuition, endowments) than most peer nations; at the K–12 level, however, spending is almost entirely public.   

4. How results compare  
   Despite above-average spending, U.S. 15-year-olds perform only around the OECD average in reading and science and below average in mathematics on the 2022 PISA assessment [3].  In other words, the United States is a high-spending but not a high-performing country in international tests.  

5. Large variation within the United States  
   The Economic Policy Institute points out that differences among U.S. states are bigger than the differences between the United States and most other countries: New York spent more than $24,000 per pupil in 2021 while Utah spent under $9,000.  Because of this spread, EPI argues that state-to-state comparisons are more useful for policymaking than country-to-country comparisons [4].  

6. Bottom line  
   • On any common metric—dollars per pupil, dollars adjusted for purchasing power, or share of GDP—the United States spends more on schooling than the “typical” OECD nation.  
   • Only a few very small or petroleum-rich countries spend more.  
   • High spending does not translate automatically into high average test performance, and wide disparities inside the United States complicate the national picture.
