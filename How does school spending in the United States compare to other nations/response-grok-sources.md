# How does school spending in the United States compare to other nations?

School spending in the United States is a critical topic in discussions about educational outcomes and equity, especially when compared to other nations. The U.S. invests significantly in education, often outpacing many countries in per-student expenditure, yet the outcomes and efficiency of this spending remain subjects of debate. This response examines how U.S. school spending compares to other nations, drawing on data from provided sources and additional research to provide a comprehensive overview.

The United States spends more per student on education than most other developed nations. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), in 2019, the U.S. spent approximately $14,400 per student at the elementary and secondary levels, which is higher than the average of $10,500 per student across Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries [1]. This figure includes both public and private expenditures and reflects a consistent trend of high investment over the years. For instance, when adjusted for purchasing power parity, the U.S. expenditure remains among the highest globally, surpassed only by a few nations like Luxembourg and Norway [2].

At the tertiary (higher education) level, U.S. spending is even more pronounced. The NCES data indicates that the U.S. spends about $34,500 per student, nearly double the OECD average of $17,600 [1]. This disparity is partly due to the high cost of college tuition and the significant role of private funding in American higher education. In contrast, many European countries, such as Germany and Finland, offer free or heavily subsidized higher education, resulting in lower per-student costs [3].

Despite this high spending, the U.S. does not always achieve commensurate outcomes in international assessments like the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). The 2022 PISA results, as reported by NCES, show that U.S. 15-year-olds scored below the OECD average in mathematics, though they performed near the average in reading and science [4]. This raises questions about the efficiency of U.S. education spending compared to countries like South Korea or Finland, which spend less per student but often achieve higher PISA scores [5]. The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) argues that international comparisons can be misleading due to differences in cultural, economic, and policy contexts, suggesting that state-level comparisons within the U.S. might be more actionable for policy improvement [6].

Another perspective on U.S. spending comes from examining how funds are allocated. According to the World Economic Forum, countries like Brazil and Chile, which spend less per student than the U.S., often allocate a higher percentage of their GDP to education—around 6% compared to the U.S.'s 5.4% in 2019 [7]. This suggests that while the absolute dollar amount in the U.S. is high, the relative priority of education in national budgets may be lower than in some other nations. Additionally, disparities within the U.S. system—such as funding inequities between wealthy and low-income districts—can exacerbate inefficiencies, a point often overlooked in international comparisons [8].

Critics like Freddie deBoer argue that elite education journalism in the U.S. tends to overemphasize international rankings and spending without addressing systemic issues like curriculum design or teacher training, which may have a greater impact on outcomes than raw expenditure [9]. This perspective highlights the complexity of drawing direct correlations between spending and educational success across diverse national contexts.

In conclusion, the United States spends more per student on education than most other nations, particularly at the tertiary level, but this does not always translate into superior academic outcomes on international assessments. Factors such as funding allocation, systemic inequities, and differing national priorities complicate direct comparisons. While high spending reflects a commitment to education, the efficiency and equity of these investments remain critical areas for improvement when viewed in a global context.
