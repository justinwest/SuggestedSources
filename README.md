This is a comparative AI response system that automatically generates and organizes responses from multiple AI models (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok) to user-defined questions, both with and without suggested sources.

**Use Cases:**

* Improve the quality of AI responses with human curated sources
* See how sources influence AI responses
* Compare how different AIs approach the same question
* Leverage advanced capabilities from different AI models


**Feedback:**
* [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/HPDT9PvS)


**Changelog:**
* 11-JUL-2025: Updated to include all AI responses directly in question READMEs for easier comparison.
* 10-JUL-2025: Added Grok 4 with Live Search support for real-time information retrieval.
* 29-JUN-2025: Added Grok web search support for live information retrieval.
* 27-JUN-2025: ChatGPT o3-deep-research is now active. This model is VERY expensive to run, so it's limited one update every 24 hours for each question.
