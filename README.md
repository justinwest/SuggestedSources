This is a comparative AI response system that automatically generates and organizes responses from multiple AI models (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok) to user-defined questions, both with and without suggested sources. The responses are regenerated by a script when the sources are updated.

**Use Cases:**

* Improve the quality of AI responses with human curated sources
* See how sources influence AI responses
* Compare how different AIs approach the same question

** Changelog:**
* 27-JUN-2025: ChatGPT o3-deep-research is now active. This model is VERY expensive to run, so it's limited one update every 24 hours for each question.
