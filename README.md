This is a collection of suggested sources for answering common questions, created to enhance the response of AI engines. Answers to the questions (both with and without using the sources) using Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini and Grok are included for comparison.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how much human curated sources can improve the answers generated by AI.
