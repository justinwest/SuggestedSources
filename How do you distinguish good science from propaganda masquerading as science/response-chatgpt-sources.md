# How do you distinguish good science from propaganda masquerading as science?

Answer  

Distinguishing good science from propaganda that merely looks scientific is a matter of asking a few disciplined questions about evidence, transparency, and process.  The NIH-staff letter analysed in the Unsafescience essay illustrates the warning signs of propaganda and, by contrast, what genuine scientific reasoning looks like [1].  

1. Ask whether the claims rest on verifiable primary evidence  
   • Good science cites the underlying data or experiments so that others can re-analyse them.  
   • The NIH letter, by contrast, offered “no new data at all,” only assertions that the lab-origin hypothesis is “misinformation” [1].  When a document relies mainly on rhetoric rather than data, treat it with caution.

2. Look for openness about uncertainty and competing hypotheses  
   • Scientists are expected to lay out what would prove them wrong.  
   • Propaganda tends to present one conclusion as settled and delegitimise alternatives.  The NIH signatories said the debate over origin is “closed” and that discussing lab-origin “harms science,” a hallmark of propaganda because genuine science keeps hypotheses open to falsification [1].

3. Check whether authority is substituted for argument  
   • Appeals to large numbers of “experts,” job titles, or institutional prestige cannot substitute for logic and data.  
   • The letter leaned heavily on the signatories’ NIH affiliation to claim credibility instead of providing evidence—another red flag [1].

4. Inspect how counter-evidence is handled  
   • Real science engages competing data openly; propaganda ignores or straw-mans it.  
   • Unsafescience notes that the letter never addressed the specific genome features that motivate the lab-origin question, but simply labelled discussion “conspiratorial” [1].

5. Examine transparency of process and potential conflicts  
   • Scientific work is normally peer-reviewed and its funding sources declared.  
   • The letter was released first to sympathetic media and only later posted publicly, bypassing normal scholarly channels—behaviour typical of advocacy, not science [1].

6. Look for reproducibility and independent critique  
   • If a claim cannot be independently reproduced or the methods are hidden, scepticism is warranted.  
   • Because the letter contained no methods, nothing in it could be subjected to replication, another sign it functions as persuasive messaging rather than research [1].

7. Watch the language  
   • Science uses cautious wording (“suggests,” “consistent with,” “more data needed”).  
   • Propaganda uses moralising or absolutist language (“dangerous misinformation,” “settled,” “denialism”), which the NIH letter repeatedly employed [1].

By systematically checking these facets—evidence, openness to refutation, transparency, engagement with counter-arguments, and language—you can separate authentic scientific reasoning from advocacy that merely wears scientific clothing.

[1] Unsafescience substack essay (https://unsafescience.substack.com/p/nih-staff-revolt-promotes-propaganda) – The author critiques an internal NIH letter that denounced public discussion of a possible lab origin of SARS-CoV-2.  He argues the letter is propaganda because it supplies no new data, relies on institutional authority, stifles debate, and uses moralistic language instead of scientific reasoning.
