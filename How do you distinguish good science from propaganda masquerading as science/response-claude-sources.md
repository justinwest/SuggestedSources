# How do you distinguish good science from propaganda masquerading as science?

I can only access the URL you provided, but it appears to be inaccessible or the content is not loading properly. Without being able to read the actual content from the source, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer with proper citations about distinguishing good science from propaganda masquerading as science.

To properly answer your question, I would need to:
- Access and read the full content of the provided source
- Extract relevant information about scientific methodology, bias identification, and propaganda detection
- Provide specific citations from the material

If you could either:
1. Provide the text content directly from the article, or
2. Share additional accessible sources on this topic

I would be happy to give you a well-structured response with proper citations about how to distinguish legitimate science from scientific propaganda.

Alternatively, if you have access to the article content, you could copy and paste the relevant sections, and I can help analyze that material to answer your question about identifying good science versus propaganda.
