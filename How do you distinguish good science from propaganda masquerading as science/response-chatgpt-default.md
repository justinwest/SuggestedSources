# How do you distinguish good science from propaganda masquerading as science?

HOW TO DISTINGUISH GOOD SCIENCE FROM PROPAGANDA MASQUERADING AS SCIENCE

────────────────────────────────────────
1. Understand What “Good Science” Looks Like
────────────────────────────────────────
A. Follows the Scientific Method  
   • States a clear, testable question or hypothesis.  
   • Describes explicit methodology so others can replicate the work.  
   • Collects and analyzes data with appropriate, transparent statistics.  
   • Draws conclusions that are limited to what the data can actually support.  
   • Acknowledges uncertainties, limitations, and alternative explanations.

B. Is Peer-Reviewed and Publicly Accessible  
   • Appears in reputable, indexed journals that use independent peer review (e.g., journals listed in PubMed, Web of Science).  
   • Provides a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) or other traceable citation.  
   • Makes data, code, or materials available (or explains why not).

C. Is Reproducible or Independently Confirmed  
   • Other groups can repeat the study and obtain similar results.  
   • Findings fit coherently with the broader body of evidence (or, if they contradict it, present robust data that withstand scrutiny).

D. Discloses Funding, Conflicts of Interest, and Ethics Approval  
   • Lists financial backers, institutional affiliations, and ethics-review information.  
   • Explains any commercial stakes the authors might have in the results.

E. Places Results in Context  
   • References prior literature accurately and fairly.  
   • Distinguishes correlation from causation.  
   • Uses effect sizes and confidence intervals, not only P-values.  
   • Does not over-generalize from small, preliminary, or animal studies.

────────────────────────────────────────
2. Learn the Hallmarks of Pseudo-Scientific Propaganda
────────────────────────────────────────
A. No Real Peer Review  
   • Distributed as white papers, blog posts, “e-books,” or videos without external critique.  
   • Cites predatory journals, vanity presses, or “in-house” outlets created by the sponsoring organization.

B. Hidden or Conflicted Funding  
   • Financial backing from stakeholders who benefit directly from a specific conclusion (e.g., tobacco, fossil fuel, supplement industry) is undisclosed or minimized.

C. Cherry-Picking and Confirmation Bias  
   • Highlights isolated studies that support a predetermined narrative while ignoring the full weight of evidence, meta-analyses, or consensus reports.

D. Misuse of Statistics  
   • Treats correlation as proof of causation, or searches data sets until a “significant” result appears (p-hacking).  
   • Presents absolute risk reductions without baseline numbers, or vice versa.

E. Absolutist or Emotional Language  
   • Uses words like “proven,” “miracle,” “suppressed,” “breakthrough the establishment doesn’t want you to know,” or appeals to fear and outrage.

F. Attacks on Mainstream Science and Scientists  
   • Frames disagreement as conspiracy, claiming journals, universities, or governments are colluding to hide “the truth.”  
   • Relies on ad-hominem attacks instead of methodological critique.

G. Lack of Methodological Detail  
   • Provides no sample sizes, protocols, or raw data; says “proprietary” or “too technical.”

H. Moving Goalposts and Unfalsifiable Claims  
   • When a prediction fails, redefines success or shifts to a new claim rather than acknowledging error.

────────────────────────────────────────
3. A Practical 10-Step Evaluation Checklist
────────────────────────────────────────
1. Source Verification  
   • Who authored the claim? Search their publication record (PubMed, Google Scholar) and credentials.  
   • Is the journal legitimate? Check DOAJ, Web of Science, or lists of predatory publishers.

2. Funding & Conflicts  
   • Is funding disclosed? Run quick searches (“Organization X funding controversy”) for hidden interests.

3. Peer-Review Status  
   • Is the work preprint, conference abstract, or peer-reviewed article? Preprints can be valuable but are provisional.

4. Methodology Transparency  
   • Can you find a clear description of participants, instruments, procedures, and statistics?

5. Data Availability & Reproducibility  
   • Are raw data, code, or detailed supplements provided? Look for repositories (OSF, Zenodo, Dryad).

6. Statistical Soundness  
   • Are sample sizes adequate, controls appropriate, and error bars or confidence intervals supplied?   
   • Is causality asserted carefully?

7. Consistency With Broader Evidence  
   • Check systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and consensus statements (e.g., Cochrane Library, National Academies, IPCC).

8. Independent Replication  
   • Have other groups replicated the finding? Use “replication” or “reproducibility” as search terms along with key author names.

9. Language and Rhetoric  
   • Note emotive language, conspiratorial framing, or slogans (“just asking questions”)—all common propaganda techniques.

10. Media Coverage vs. Primary Literature  
   • Trace sensational headlines back to the original paper. Does the paper actually support the headlines? Press releases often exaggerate.

────────────────────────────────────────
4. Useful Tools & Resources
────────────────────────────────────────
• PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science – locate peer-reviewed papers.  
• DOAJ (Directory of Open Access Journals) – check journal legitimacy.  
• Retraction Watch Database – see if work has been retracted.  
• Altmetric & CrossRef – track discussion and corrections.  
• Cochrane Library, Campbell Collaboration – systematic reviews on health and social policy.  
• Open Science Framework, GitHub – hosts raw data and code.  
• Fact-checking sites (HealthFeedback.org, ClimateFeedback.org, Snopes) – expert reviews of scientific claims.

────────────────────────────────────────
5. Real-World Case Studies (Brief)
────────────────────────────────────────
A. Tobacco Industry Research (1950s–90s)  
   • Funded studies designed to create doubt, cherry-picked data, and invoked “more research is needed.”  
   • Failed reproducibility and hid internal memos acknowledging harm.

B. Climate Change Denial  
   • White papers from think tanks posing as scientific reports.  
   • Lack of peer review; frequently cite each other rather than mainstream climate journals.

C. Anti-Vaccination Claims  
   • Andrew Wakefield’s retracted MMR-autism paper: undisclosed legal funding, small sample size, no replication, ethical breaches.  
   • Propagandists still cite it, ignoring its retraction and scores of contradictory epidemiological studies.

────────────────────────────────────────
6. Bottom Line
────────────────────────────────────────
Good science is a collective, self-correcting process grounded in transparency, replication, and critical peer scrutiny. Propaganda masquerading as science typically bypasses or distorts that process, relies on rhetorical tricks, hides conflicts of interest, and presents certainty where true science expresses measured confidence.

Cultivating a habit of skeptical inquiry—asking “Who says? On what evidence? Using what methods? Verified by whom? Funded by whom? Reproduced how?”—is the most reliable way to separate robust scientific knowledge from polished but misleading imitation.
