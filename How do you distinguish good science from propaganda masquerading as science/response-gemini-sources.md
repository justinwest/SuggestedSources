# How do you distinguish good science from propaganda masquerading as science?

Based on the provided source, one can distinguish good science from propaganda masquerading as science by examining the methods of argumentation, the handling of evidence, and the overall intent [1].

Propaganda often employs the following characteristics:
*   **Emotional Manipulation:** It relies on "emotional appeals" and "manipulative language" rather than objective, data-driven arguments. The source describes a letter from NIH staff as an "emotional tantrum" designed to frame an issue in a way that generates an emotional response, such as using phrases like "chilling effect" and "dangerous precedent" [1].
*   **Omission of Key Facts:** Propaganda will selectively present information and ignore inconvenient truths that contradict its narrative. The source argues that the NIH staff letter is propaganda because it omits critical details about the "numerous biosafety issues" and risky research practices associated with the group it defends, thereby presenting a misleading picture of the situation [1].
*   **Attacking Critics to Shut Down Debate:** Rather than engaging with the substance of criticism, propaganda often seeks to discredit opponents. The source notes that the letter dismisses legitimate scientific and safety concerns by labeling them as "misinformation," "disinformation," and "conspiracy theories." This tactic is used to silence dissent and avoid accountability instead of fostering open scientific inquiry [1].
*   **Prioritizing a Narrative Over Evidence:** Propaganda is dedicated to advancing a specific "propaganda narrative," even when it conflicts with available evidence. The source claims the NIH letter prioritizes defending a particular group and a preferred narrative about COVID-19's origins over confronting the "uncomfortable truths" about research risks and oversight failures [1].

In contrast, the principles of good science, as implied by the source's critique, include:
*   **Objectivity and Dispassion:** Scientific arguments should be based on evidence and data, free from emotional manipulation [1].
*   **Transparency and Honesty:** Good science requires acknowledging all relevant facts, including those that are inconvenient or expose errors, such as biosafety failures [1].
*   **Openness to Scrutiny:** Science thrives on rigorous debate, questioning, and the willingness to address substantive criticism rather than dismissing it with labels [1].
*   **Accountability:** A core component of the scientific process is accountability for research methods, safety protocols, and outcomes [1].

### Sources
1.  The author, writing as "A Midwestern Doctor" on the "Unsafe Science" Substack, argues that a letter from NIH staff defending the research group EcoHealth Alliance is a form of propaganda. The author contends that the letter uses emotional manipulation, omits critical facts about biosafety failures, and attempts to shut down legitimate scientific debate by labeling criticism as misinformation, thereby distinguishing its approach from the principles of good science.
