IQ tests, formally known as intelligence quotient tests, are standardized assessments designed to measure cognitive abilities such as reasoning, problem-solving, memory, and verbal comprehension. They aim to quantify a person's intellectual potential relative to the general population, typically yielding a score where 100 is average, with a standard deviation of 15 [1]. However, the accuracy of IQ tests is a nuanced topic in psychology, involving concepts like reliability (consistency of results), validity (whether they measure what they claim to), and broader limitations. This response explores these aspects, drawing on empirical evidence and expert consensus to provide a balanced view.

### Reliability of IQ Tests
IQ tests are generally considered highly reliable, meaning they produce consistent results when administered multiple times to the same individual under similar conditions. Modern IQ tests, such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) or Stanford-Binet, have reliability coefficients (a statistical measure of consistency) typically ranging from 0.90 to 0.98 [1]. This indicates that about 90-98% of the variance in scores is due to true differences in ability rather than measurement error. For example, test-retest reliability studies show that scores remain stable over time, with correlations often exceeding 0.80 even after several years [2].

However, reliability can be affected by factors like test-taker fatigue, motivation, or environmental distractions. Short-term fluctuations of 5-10 points are common, but significant changes (e.g., due to brain injury or education) can occur [3]. Overall, experts agree that well-designed IQ tests are among the most reliable psychological assessments available [1].

### Validity and What IQ Tests Measure
Validity assesses whether IQ tests accurately measure intelligence. IQ tests are valid predictors of certain outcomes, particularly those related to "general intelligence" or the g-factor—a statistical construct representing shared variance across cognitive tasks [1]. They correlate moderately to strongly with academic performance (r ≈ 0.50-0.70), job success in complex roles (r ≈ 0.30-0.50), and even life expectancy or socioeconomic status [2]. A landmark review by the American Psychological Association (APA) concluded that IQ tests effectively measure cognitive abilities that are important for success in industrialized societies [1].

That said, IQ tests do not capture all aspects of intelligence. Critics argue they overemphasize analytical and logical skills while neglecting creativity, emotional intelligence, practical skills, or social intelligence [3]. Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences, for instance, posits at least eight distinct forms (e.g., musical, interpersonal), which IQ tests largely ignore [4]. Additionally, IQ scores explain only about 25-50% of the variance in real-world success, with factors like personality, motivation, and opportunity playing larger roles [2].

### Limitations and Criticisms Affecting Accuracy
Several factors can undermine the accuracy of IQ tests:

- **Cultural and Socioeconomic Bias**: IQ tests are often criticized for favoring individuals from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies. Questions may assume cultural knowledge that disadvantages non-native speakers or those from diverse backgrounds, leading to score disparities (e.g., average gaps of 10-15 points between racial or ethnic groups in the U.S.) [1][3]. While efforts like culture-fair tests (e.g., Raven's Progressive Matrices) mitigate this, biases persist [5].

- **Environmental Influences**: IQ is not fixed; it's influenced by genetics (heritability estimates of 50-80% in adults) and environment (e.g., nutrition, education, stress) [1]. The Flynn effect—rising average IQ scores by about 3 points per decade globally—suggests that tests may not accurately reflect innate ability but rather improvements in education and health [2].

- **Overinterpretation**: IQ tests are snapshots, not comprehensive profiles. High scores don't guarantee success, and low scores can stigmatize individuals, ignoring neurodiversity (e.g., in autism or ADHD) [3]. They also fail to predict outcomes in non-cognitive domains, such as artistic achievement or leadership [4].

Empirical studies show that while IQ tests are accurate for group predictions (e.g., in educational placement), their precision for individuals is limited—error bands mean a score of 100 could truly range from 95 to 105 [1].

### Overall Accuracy and Expert Consensus
In summary, IQ tests are accurate and useful tools for measuring specific cognitive abilities, with strong reliability and predictive validity for academic and occupational outcomes [1][2]. However, they are not infallible or comprehensive measures of overall intelligence, human potential, or worth. The APA's task force on intelligence described them as "reasonably good" but emphasized the need for cautious interpretation, especially across cultures [1]. Critics view them as overly narrow or biased, advocating for multifaceted assessments [3][4]. For most purposes, IQ tests should be used alongside other evaluations, such as achievement tests or behavioral observations, to enhance accuracy.

If you're considering an IQ test, consult a qualified psychologist, as self-administered online versions are often unreliable [5].
