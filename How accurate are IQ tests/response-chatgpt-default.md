How “accurate” an IQ test is depends on what you mean by accuracy.  Psychometricians usually separate the concept into two big questions:

1. Reliability – Does the test yield the same or very similar scores when nothing about the person’s true ability has changed?  
2. Validity – Does the score actually measure, or predict, the things it claims to measure or predict?

Below is a summary of what researchers know about both issues, the statistical numbers that frame them, and the caveats that are often overlooked.

─────────────────────────
I. Reliability (Consistency)
─────────────────────────
1. Test-retest reliability  
   • Modern, well-normed clinical batteries (e.g., WAIS-IV, WISC-V, Stanford-Binet-5) typically report test-retest correlations of .90–.96 for Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ) across retest intervals of a few weeks to a year.  
   • A correlation of .95 translates into a typical change of ±3–4 points for most individuals if you took the same test twice under similar conditions.

2. Internal-consistency reliability  
   • Because today’s tests sample many subtests (verbal, visual-spatial, working memory, processing speed), Cronbach’s alpha or split-half coefficients for FSIQ are usually above .95.  
   • Subtests themselves are less stable (often .80–.90), so profiles of strengths and weaknesses are noisier than the overall IQ.

3. Standard Error of Measurement (SEM)  
   • For a standardized IQ scale (mean = 100, SD = 15) the SEM is usually 2–3 points for FSIQ on major tests.  
   • Therefore, an obtained score of 110 should be interpreted as a band (roughly 105–115 with 95 % confidence).

Bottom line on reliability: Professionally administered IQ tests are among the most reliable measurements in psychology and rival many biomedical lab tests for precision—provided they are administered and scored correctly.

II. Validity (What IQ Is Good For)
─────────────────────────
1. Construct validity (Does it measure “general intelligence”?)  
   • Factor-analytic studies repeatedly show that most subtests load strongly on a single general factor (g).  
   • Measurement-invariance studies across languages and cultures reveal a core g factor that is largely comparable, though some subtests show cultural bias.

2. Concurrent (cross-sectional) validity  
   • Correlations with school achievement: ~.50–.70 (depending on age, subject, and quality of measurement of achievement).  
   • Correlations with standardized academic tests (e.g., SAT, ACT): ~.60–.80 because those exams themselves capture g.

3. Predictive validity  
   • Years of education completed: r ≈ .50.  
   • First-year college GPA: r ≈ .40–.50 after correcting for range restriction.  
   • Job performance (supervisory ratings, productivity metrics): r ≈ .20–.60, higher for complex occupations. Meta-analytic estimate: r ≈ .51 after correcting for measurement error and range restriction.  
   • Income and occupational status in mid-adulthood: r ≈ .30–.40.  
   • Health-related outcomes and longevity: small to moderate correlations (.10–.20) after controlling for SES.

Interpretation: IQ explains a meaningful but far from exhaustive portion of variance in real-world outcomes: roughly 10–30 % after statistical corrections. Environment, personality traits (e.g., conscientiousness), opportunity, and luck still matter a great deal.

III. Limits, Sources of Error, and Misconceptions
─────────────────────────
1. Administration fidelity  
   • Scores from short online quizzes or employer “proctored” screeners are much less reliable (r ≈ .60–.80) than full clinical batteries.  
   • Administration errors (timing, prompting, scoring) can easily move a score ±5–10 points.

2. Practice and coaching effects  
   • For children, repeated exposure within a year can raise scores 4–7 points via practice alone.  
   • Coaching on specific item types can boost certain subtest scores (e.g., matrix reasoning) but rarely more than 5–6 points on FSIQ.

3. Cultural and language bias  
   • Non-native language, socioeconomic deprivation, and limited exposure to “school-like” problem formats depress scores.  
   • “Culture-reduced” tests (Raven’s, Cattell Culture Fair) lessen but do not eliminate group differences.  
   • Differential Item Functioning (DIF) studies show relatively few items with large bias in modern tests, but group mean differences (e.g., race, SES) persist for reasons still debated.

4. Extreme ranges  
   • Ceiling effects: Above ~140, raw-score increments often correspond to large IQ intervals; ranking very gifted individuals becomes less precise.  
   • Floor effects: Below IQ ≈ 50, standard batteries have few easy items, so measurement error rises.

5. Flynn Effect and norms obsolescence  
   • Raw scores have risen about 2–3 IQ points per decade in many countries.  
   • If a test is not renormed about every 10 years, average examinees score above 100 artificially.

6. Construct under-representation  
   • IQ does not directly measure creativity, wisdom, grit, social intelligence, or domain-specific expertise.  
   • Broad cognitive ability frameworks (e.g., CHC theory) acknowledge multiple narrow abilities beyond g, but most real-life tasks also require non-cognitive traits.

─────────────────────────
IV. Practical Guidelines for Interpreting IQ
─────────────────────────
1. Treat any single score as a band (±5 points for 68 % confidence; ±7–8 for 95 %).  
2. Look for corroborating evidence (grades, work samples, adaptive behavior, clinical history).  
3. Consider cultural-language background and any testing accommodations.  
4. For high-stakes decisions (special education, gifted placement, neuropsych diagnosis), insist on a full, professionally administered battery and up-to-date norms.  
5. Remember that IQ is descriptive, not destiny; it quantifies a statistical tendency, not a fixed ceiling on learning or achievement.

─────────────────────────
V. Bottom Line
─────────────────────────
• Accuracy (reliability) of professionally administered modern IQ tests is very high—among the best in the behavioral sciences. An individual’s true score is usually within a few points of the obtained score.  
• Predictive accuracy (validity) is moderate to strong for academic learning and for jobs that rely heavily on complex reasoning, but much lower for outcomes heavily influenced by personality, motivation, resources, or luck.  
• The tests are less precise at the extreme high and low ends, can be affected by cultural and situational factors, and do not capture the full richness of human cognitive functioning.  
• Used appropriately and interpreted in context, IQ tests are valuable diagnostic and predictive tools; used simplistically or without regard for their limitations, they can mislead.
