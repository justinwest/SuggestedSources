How “accurate” an IQ (intelligence-quotient) test is depends on what aspect of accuracy we look at.  In psychological measurement the two main yardsticks are reliability (does the test give you the same score when nothing has really changed?) and validity (does the score mean something in the real world?).  On both counts, modern IQ batteries perform unusually well compared with almost any other psychological instrument.

1. Reliability – how consistent are the scores?

•  Internal-consistency and split-half reliabilities for widely-used full-scale IQ batteries (e.g., WAIS, WISC, Stanford–Binet) are typically above .95, and short-form “matrix” tests are usually above .90.  
  (What Do Undergraduates Learn About Human Intelligence?, 2018, p. 12)

•  Test–retest correlations over a period of a few weeks to a few months are normally in the .90s; over many years they remain respectable (≈.70–.80 from childhood into middle age).  
  (Myths and Misconceptions About Intelligence, 2021, pp. 5-6)

Interpretation: fewer than 5 % of the score points on a well-standardised IQ test are due to random measurement error.

2. Construct validity – do the tests really tap “general intelligence” (g)?

•  Factor-analytic studies show that different IQ subtests all load strongly on a single general factor (g), and alternative indicators such as reaction-time tasks, working-memory span, and scholastic aptitude tests converge on the same latent trait.  
  (Communicating Intelligence Research, 2018, p. 301)

3. Predictive validity – do scores forecast anything important?

Average correlations (meta-analytic averages are in parentheses):

•  Current school grades/standardized achievement (.50)  
•  Years of education completed (.55)  
•  Job performance ratings/ work-sample tests (.35–.50)  
•  Income (.30–.40)  
•  Occupational prestige (.45)  
•  Lower probability of criminal conviction (≈ –.20)

These effect sizes are large for the behavioural sciences.  For example, an IQ difference of one standard deviation (15 points) translates into roughly a 50 % higher probability of completing college and about a 10 % productivity advantage in medium-complexity jobs.

4. Cross-group fairness

•  Minority-group mean differences exist, but extensive “differential-item-functioning” analyses show that well-constructed IQ tests are not biased against particular ethnic, sex or social-class groups; people who have the same latent ability obtain the same expected scores.  
  (Myths and Misconceptions About Intelligence, 2021, pp. 13-15)

5. Limitations – what IQ tests do not do

•  They are less reliable at the extreme ends of the scale (very low or very high ability) because there are fewer items tailored for those ranges.  
•  A single score does not capture every valuable trait (creativity, practical know-how, personality, motivation).  
•  Acute factors (fatigue, illness, anxiety, cheating) can distort an individual’s score even though such noise is small in the aggregate.  
  (Intelligence: All That Matters, 2013, ch. 2)

6. Bottom line

•  By psychometric standards IQ tests are extraordinarily accurate: reliabilities around .95 and predictive validities in the .3–.6 range put them at, or near, the top of all psychological measures.  
•  They are not crystal balls, but they deliver stable information about a person’s general cognitive ability and allow reasonably strong predictions about educational, occupational, and many other life outcomes.
