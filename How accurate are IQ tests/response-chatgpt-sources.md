# How accurate are IQ tests?

How “accurate” an IQ score is depends on what aspect of accuracy you mean—reliability (can the score be reproduced?), validity (does it measure what it is supposed to?), and the practical size of the errors involved. The consensus in the technical literature, reflected in the six sources supplied, is that modern IQ tests are among the most accurate tools in all of psychology, although they are—like any measurement—imperfect.  

1. Reliability: getting the same score twice  
   • Major individually administered batteries (e.g., WAIS, WISC, Stanford-Binet) show test-retest reliabilities of .86–.96, meaning less than 15 % of the variance is random error [1] [2].  
   • Different IQ tests correlate .70–.90 with one another, showing that they are measuring the same underlying construct (general intelligence, g) [2] [3].  

2. Validity: predicting what matters in the real world  
   • Educational achievement: correlations typically fall between .50 and .70; an IQ test explains more of the variance in school grades than any other single predictor [2] [3].  
   • Job performance: meta-analyses give correlations of roughly .30–.50, rising when jobs are complex [2].  
   • Income, health, longevity and reduced criminality all show smaller but statistically reliable links (.10–.30) [2].  
   • These predictive relationships replicate across cultures, social classes and historical periods, which is why psychometricians describe IQ tests as having “robust” external validity [1] [4].  

3. Precision of a single score  
   • Even a highly reliable test has a standard error of measurement (often ±3–5 points). A person who scores 103 today might score 97 or 108 tomorrow without any real change in ability [1].  
   • Motivation, fatigue, test anxiety and practice can shift scores a few points, but large shifts are uncommon unless the life situation changes radically (brain injury, serious illness, prolonged cognitive training, etc.) [4].  

4. What IQ tests do—and do not—measure  
   • They are designed to tap the cognitive traits that load on g: reasoning, working memory, processing speed, verbal comprehension, visual-spatial skills.  
   • They do not directly assess personality, creativity, wisdom, moral character or specialized talents (e.g., musical ability) [1] [4].  
   • Thus, a person can be “smart” in some colloquial sense (funny, artistic, street-wise) and still have a modest IQ score, or vice-versa.  

5. Are the tests biased?  
   • Item-level studies show that questions that are harder for one demographic group than another are routinely removed during test construction; the residual group differences mainly reflect real differences in average g, not test artefacts [1] [4].  
   • When socioeconomic status is held constant, the predictive validity of IQ remains essentially unchanged, which would not be true if the tests were simply “cultural knowledge quizzes” [3] [4].  

6. Why the public is often sceptical  
   • Introductory psychology textbooks and media coverage frequently under-state the empirical strengths of IQ testing, leading to widespread myths such as “IQ only measures how well you take IQ tests” or “IQ is meaningless because the brain is plastic” [5] [6].  

Bottom line  
• If by “accurate” we mean highly reliable, strongly predictive of important life outcomes, and well-validated across populations, modern IQ tests score very well.  
• If by “accurate” we expect a one-number oracle that captures every form of human talent without error, IQ tests inevitably fall short.  
• Treat an IQ result the way you would a medical lab value: precise enough to be useful, always surrounded by a confidence band, and best interpreted alongside other information about the person.
