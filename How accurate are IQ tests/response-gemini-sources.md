Based on the provided sources, IQ tests are considered among the most accurate and reliable instruments in the field of psychology [2, 4]. Their accuracy is assessed in two primary ways: reliability (consistency) and validity (measuring what they are supposed to measure and predicting relevant outcomes) [2].

### Reliability
Reliability refers to the consistency of a test. A reliable test will produce similar results when the same person takes it on different occasions. Modern IQ tests are highly reliable, with test-retest correlations typically around .95 out of a possible 1.0. This level of consistency is exceptionally high for a psychological measure [2]. An individual's IQ score tends to be very stable throughout their life, particularly after adolescence [2, 4].

### Validity
Validity is the extent to which a test measures the concept it claims to measure (in this case, general intelligence) and its ability to predict real-world outcomes.

**1. Measuring General Intelligence (Construct Validity)**
IQ tests are considered valid measures of a well-established construct known as general cognitive ability or the general factor of intelligence (*g*). Scores on various subtests within an IQ test (e.g., verbal comprehension, spatial reasoning, working memory) are positively correlated with each other, suggesting they are all tapping into a common underlying ability [2]. This general factor, *g*, is what IQ tests are primarily designed to capture [2, 4].

**2. Predicting Real-World Outcomes (Predictive Validity)**
A significant body of evidence demonstrates that IQ scores are the single most effective predictor of a wide range of important life outcomes [1, 2, 4]:
*   **Academic Performance**: IQ scores are the strongest known predictor of academic achievement, including grades and years of education completed. The correlation is substantial, though not perfect [2, 4].
*   **Job Performance**: Decades of research and numerous meta-analyses show that IQ is the best single predictor of performance across all jobs [2, 8]. The correlation is stronger for more complex jobs (e.g., lawyers, engineers) and weaker, but still present, for less complex jobs [2, 8]. Some critiques of this link are based on statistical misunderstandings, such as failing to account for "range restriction" (the fact that people within a single profession already have a somewhat limited and higher-than-average range of IQs) [8].
*   **Other Life Outcomes**: Higher IQ scores are statistically associated with higher income, better health, a longer lifespan, and a lower likelihood of outcomes such as being convicted of a crime or living in poverty [2].

### Misconceptions and Controversies
Despite the strong scientific consensus on their reliability and validity, IQ tests are a subject of public controversy and are often misrepresented in popular media [3, 6]. Many common beliefs about IQ tests are considered myths by experts in the field [4].

*   **Myth: IQ tests are biased.** A common claim is that IQ tests are culturally biased against certain groups. However, extensive research has found that major IQ tests are not statistically biased; they predict outcomes like academic and job performance with the same degree of accuracy for different ethnic and social groups [2, 4]. While group differences in average scores exist, the tests are not the cause of these differences and are not flawed in their predictive ability for any single group [1, 4].
*   **Myth: IQ tests only measure how well you take a test.** This is incorrect. The reason IQ tests are valued is precisely because they predict performance in real-world settings far beyond the test itself, as outlined above [2, 4].
*   **Media Misrepresentation**: Much of the public skepticism can be traced to poor journalism and outdated critiques [3]. Journalists often fail to engage with the modern scientific consensus, instead platforming a "false balance" between experts and critics whose views were discredited decades ago [3, 6]. Introductory psychology textbooks also frequently contain inaccurate or incomplete information about intelligence, contributing to widespread misunderstanding [5].

In conclusion, the expert consensus described in the provided sources is that professionally developed IQ tests are highly reliable and valid psychological instruments. They consistently measure general cognitive ability and are a powerful predictor of academic success, job performance, and many other life outcomes [2, 4, 8]. The controversy surrounding them is largely a social and political phenomenon, not a reflection of a scientific debate among experts in the field [1, 3, 6]. The vast body of research on this topic supports their scientific utility [7].
