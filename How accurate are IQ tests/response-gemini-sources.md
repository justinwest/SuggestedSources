# How accurate are IQ tests?

Based on the provided sources, IQ tests are considered to be highly accurate, reliable, and valid psychological instruments. The consensus among the authors is that IQ tests are among the most successful and robust tools in all of psychology, though this is often misrepresented in public and media discourse [3, 6].

The accuracy of IQ tests can be understood in three main ways:

### 1. Reliability (Consistency)
The sources state that IQ tests are highly reliable, meaning they produce consistent results. Modern, professionally developed IQ tests have reliability coefficients of around .95 out of a possible 1.0, which is exceptionally high for any psychological measure [4]. This high reliability indicates that an individual's score will be remarkably stable over their lifetime, especially after late adolescence [2, 4].

### 2. Validity (Measuring What They Claim to Measure)
The sources affirm that IQ tests are valid measures of general intelligence, often referred to as the general factor of intelligence or "*g*" [2, 4]. This *g* factor is a real-world phenomenon that represents a person's overall cognitive ability, and IQ tests are the best available tools for measuring it [1, 4]. The existence of *g* is supported by the fact that performance on all different types of cognitive tasks—from verbal to spatial to mathematical—are positively correlated with one another [2]. Despite criticisms, the overwhelming expert consensus is that the tests validly measure this general mental ability [3].

### 3. Predictive Accuracy (Predicting Real-World Outcomes)
A key strength of IQ tests highlighted across the sources is their ability to predict a wide range of important life outcomes. IQ is described as the single best predictor of both academic and job performance [1, 2]. Specifically:
*   **Academic and Job Success:** IQ scores are highly correlated with educational attainment, performance in job training programs, and overall job performance, especially in complex roles [2, 4].
*   **Other Life Outcomes:** Higher IQ scores are also statistically linked to higher income, greater longevity, better health, and a lower likelihood of various negative outcomes, such as dying in an accident or being incarcerated [2].

The sources collectively argue that the scientific evidence for the accuracy and utility of IQ tests is strong and well-established [1, 3]. They suggest that much of the public controversy and skepticism surrounding IQ tests stems not from scientific shortcomings, but from ideological bias, media misrepresentation, and a general lack of understanding of the research [3, 5, 6].
