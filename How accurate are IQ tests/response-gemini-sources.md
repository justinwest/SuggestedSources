Based on the provided sources, IQ tests are considered to be among the most accurate and reliable instruments in the field of psychology [2, 4]. The term "accuracy" in this context refers to two key psychometric properties: reliability (consistency) and validity (measuring what it is supposed to measure and predicting relevant outcomes) [2].

### Reliability: Consistency of Results
IQ tests demonstrate high reliability. This means that if a person takes the same test or a comparable version on two different occasions, their scores will be very similar. Test-retest correlations for modern IQ tests are typically above .90 (with a perfect correlation being 1.0), indicating a high degree of consistency over time [2]. This level of reliability is higher than that of most other psychological assessments [4].

### Validity: Measuring Intelligence and Predicting Outcomes
The validity of IQ tests is supported by extensive evidence showing they measure a general cognitive ability and predict a wide range of real-world outcomes [1, 2].

**1. Measuring General Intelligence (g-factor)**
Modern IQ tests are designed to measure the *g-factor*, or general intelligence. This concept is based on the consistent finding that performance on all types of cognitive tasks—such as verbal, mathematical, spatial, and memory tasks—are positively correlated. Individuals who do well on one type of task tend to do well on others, suggesting an underlying general mental ability that the tests effectively capture [2, 5].

**2. Predictive Validity**
A primary measure of a test's accuracy is its ability to predict future outcomes. IQ scores are strong predictors in numerous domains:
*   **Academic Performance**: IQ is the single most powerful predictor of academic achievement, with a correlation of around .50 to .70 between IQ scores and grades [2, 4].
*   **Job Performance**: Decades of research show that IQ is the best single predictor of job performance, particularly in complex jobs [1, 2, 8]. The correlation between IQ and job performance is typically cited as being between .30 and .60, depending on the complexity of the job [8]. While factors like personality (e.g., conscientiousness) also contribute, intelligence is considered the most impactful single trait [1, 2].
*   **Other Life Outcomes**: Higher IQ scores are correlated with a wide range of positive life outcomes, including better health, longer lifespan, higher income, and lower rates of criminal conviction [2, 4].

### Addressing Common Criticisms
The provided sources also address common criticisms regarding the accuracy and fairness of IQ tests.

*   **Cultural Bias**: A frequent myth is that IQ tests are fundamentally biased against certain cultural or ethnic groups. However, researchers argue that modern tests have been carefully designed to minimize cultural bias. The most compelling evidence against the bias argument is that the tests have similar predictive validity across different demographic groups. For example, the tests predict academic performance and job success just as well for minority group members as for majority group members, which would not be the case if the tests were significantly biased [2, 4].
*   **IQ is Not Everything**: While IQ is a powerful predictor, the sources clarify that it is not the only factor determining life success. Other traits like motivation, conscientiousness, creativity, and social skills also play important roles [1, 2]. IQ scores represent a measure of cognitive ability, not a person's ultimate worth or destiny.

### The Gap Between Scientific Consensus and Public Perception
Several sources note a significant disconnect between the scientific consensus on the accuracy of IQ tests and how they are portrayed in media and journalism [3, 6]. Critics argue that journalists often misrepresent the research, amplify outdated critiques, and ignore the vast body of evidence supporting the tests' reliability and validity [3]. This "Gould Effect," named after a prominent critic of IQ testing, has led to widespread public misunderstanding of what the science says [6]. Even introductory psychology textbooks have been found to present an incomplete or misleading picture of intelligence research [5].

In conclusion, according to the provided sources, the mainstream scientific view is that professionally developed IQ tests are highly reliable and valid psychological instruments. They consistently measure general cognitive ability and are the single best predictor of important life outcomes such as academic and job success, though they are not the sole determinant of a person's future.
