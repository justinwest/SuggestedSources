Personal superintelligence is a term primarily used and promoted by Meta to describe a future form of artificial intelligence designed to function as a highly advanced, personalized assistant for individuals [1]. It is distinct from the traditional academic concept of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).

The core characteristics of personal superintelligence, according to Meta's vision, include:

*   **Personalization and Integration:** It is not a disembodied, general intelligence but one that is deeply integrated into a person's daily life through devices like smart glasses (e.g., Ray-Ban Meta glasses) and virtual/augmented reality headsets. It would have context about your world and your needs to provide relevant assistance [1].
*   **Conversational and Multimodal:** This AI is intended to be interacted with naturally through conversation. It would understand and process not only text and voice but also visual information from the world around you, allowing you to ask questions about what you are seeing [1].
*   **Assistive and Utilitarian:** Its primary purpose is to help with a wide range of everyday tasks, from creative endeavors and coding to social interactions and learning new skills. The goal is to augment human capabilities, not replace them entirely, acting as a supportive partner in daily activities [1].
*   **A Stepping Stone to Higher Intelligence:** Meta frames "personal superintelligence" as a practical, product-focused step on the path toward building more generally intelligent systems. The vision is to start with a useful, human-centric AI and responsibly build toward human-level and eventually superhuman-level intelligence [1].

In contrast, the term "superintelligence," as defined in the broader field of AI research by thinkers like Nick Bostrom, refers to an "intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest" [2]. This more traditional concept (ASI) describes a hypothetical agent that would be vastly more capable than any human in areas like scientific discovery, strategic planning, and social manipulation.

Therefore, the key distinction is one of scope and purpose. Traditional superintelligence (ASI) is a theoretical, all-encompassing intellect with transcendent capabilities [2]. Personal superintelligence is Meta's product vision for a consumer-facing, highly advanced AI assistant that is powerful yet fundamentally personal and assistive [1]. It can be seen as a branded pathway towards a form of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)—an AI with human-like cognitive abilities across many domains—but specifically tailored for individual use [3].

It describes it as an advanced AI assistant, aiming for human-level intelligence, that is built into personal devices like glasses to help users in their everyday lives. The view is commercial and user-focused, emphasizing the assistive and integrated nature of the technology.

His work defines superintelligence as an intellect that vastly surpasses the best human brains in practically every field. This view is academic and philosophical, focusing on a hypothetical, world-altering entity rather than a personal consumer product.

3.  **IBM Technology. "What is artificial general intelligence?"** This source provides a standard industry definition of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It describes AGI as a theoretical form of AI that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a broad range of tasks at a human-like level, contrasting it with narrow AI which is specialized for one task. This helps contextualize "personal superintelligence" as a branded approach to achieving a form of AGI for consumer use.
