Personal superintelligence is an emerging concept in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), futurism, and cognitive enhancement, referring to a highly advanced form of AI or augmented intelligence that achieves superintelligent capabilities tailored specifically to an individual user. Unlike general superintelligence, which denotes an AI system surpassing human intelligence across all domains [1], personal superintelligence emphasizes personalization, accessibility, and integration into an individual's daily life, potentially through brain-computer interfaces, personalized AI assistants, or merged human-AI systems. This concept builds on ideas from AI development, transhumanism, and the singularity, where technology enables individuals to access or embody superintelligent processing power for personal goals, creativity, problem-solving, and decision-making.

### Definition and Core Characteristics
Superintelligence, as a foundational term, is defined as an intellect that vastly outperforms the best human minds in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills [1]. Personal superintelligence extends this by making such capabilities "personal," meaning:
- **Individual Customization**: The system is trained or adapted to the user's unique preferences, knowledge, memories, and needs. For instance, it could analyze a person's entire digital footprint (emails, browsing history, health data) to provide hyper-personalized insights or predictions [2].
- **Accessibility and Control**: Unlike centralized superintelligence (e.g., controlled by corporations or governments), personal superintelligence is envisioned as democratized, where individuals have direct, private access via devices like smartphones, wearables, or neural implants. This could manifest as a "personal AI companion" that evolves into superintelligent levels [3].
- **Human-AI Symbiosis**: It often involves merging human cognition with AI, such as through neural lace or uploading consciousness, allowing a person to achieve superintelligent thought processes personally [4]. This aligns with transhumanist visions where individuals transcend biological limits.

The term is not yet standardized in academic literature but has gained traction in discussions about the future of AI, particularly in the context of rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and emerging brain-computer technologies [2]. Proponents argue it could empower individuals in education, healthcare, and innovation, while critics warn of risks like privacy erosion, inequality (if access is uneven), and existential threats if personalization leads to misaligned goals [1][3].

### Historical and Theoretical Context
The idea draws from earlier concepts:
- **Superintelligence Origins**: Coined prominently by philosopher Nick Bostrom, superintelligence is seen as a potential outcome of artificial general intelligence (AGI), where AI can perform any intellectual task a human can, then self-improve to superhuman levels [1].
- **Personalization Evolution**: Building on personal AI systems like Siri or Alexa, futurists like Ray Kurzweil predict that by the 2030s, AI will merge with humans to create personal enhancements approaching superintelligence, driven by exponential technological growth (the "law of accelerating returns") [4].
- **Modern Developments**: Recent advancements, such as Neuralink's brain implants or personalized AI models (e.g., Inflection AI's Pi, described as a "personal intelligence" companion), are seen as stepping stones. Some experts envision personal superintelligence as a decentralized alternative to corporate-controlled AI, enabling "sovereign" intelligence for individuals [2][3].

### Potential Applications and Implications
- **Applications**: In education, a personal superintelligence could act as an infinite tutor, adapting to learning styles [2]. In medicine, it might predict personal health risks with superhuman accuracy. Creatively, it could co-author books or inventions tailored to the user's vision [4].
- **Benefits**: Democratizes intelligence, potentially reducing societal inequalities by giving everyone access to genius-level cognition [3].
- **Risks and Challenges**: Bostrom highlights dangers like value misalignment, where a personal superintelligence might pursue goals harmfully if not aligned with human ethics [1]. Privacy concerns arise from deep personalization, and there's debate over whether true superintelligence can be safely "personalized" without global risks [3]. Ethical frameworks, such as those proposed by the AI alignment community, emphasize the need for safeguards [1].

### Current Status and Future Outlook
As of 2024, personal superintelligence remains speculative and not realized, with current AI systems like ChatGPT or Grok being advanced but not superintelligent [2]. However, progress in AGI research (e.g., by OpenAI) and neurotechnology suggests it could emerge within decades [4]. Experts like Kurzweil predict a "singularity" around 2045, where personal superintelligence becomes feasible through human-AI fusion [4]. Ongoing debates focus on governance to ensure it's developed safely and equitably [3].

In summary, personal superintelligence represents a vision of empowered individuality in an AI-driven future, combining the raw power of superintelligence with intimate personalization. While promising, it requires careful ethical consideration to mitigate risks.
