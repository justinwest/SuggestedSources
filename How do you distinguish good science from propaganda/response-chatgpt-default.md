# How do you distinguish good science from propaganda?

INTRODUCTION  
In an era of information overload, scientific claims can travel as fast as misinformation. To protect yourself and others from being manipulated, it helps to know how to recognize good science and how to spot propaganda masquerading as science. The distinction usually rests on evidence, transparency, methodology, and intent.

1. WHAT COUNTS AS “GOOD SCIENCE”?  
• Employs the scientific method (hypothesis → experiment/observation → analysis → conclusion → replication).  
• Is transparent about methods, data, and limitations.  
• Undergoes peer review and is open to replication.  
• Uses appropriate statistics and reports uncertainty (error bars, confidence intervals, p-values).  
• Acknowledges previous work, conflicting evidence, and alternative explanations.  
• Has no undisclosed conflicts of interest, or at least discloses them fully.

2. WHAT COUNTS AS PROPAGANDA?  
• Information crafted primarily to influence beliefs or behavior rather than to discover objective truth.  
• Selectively uses or misrepresents data to promote an agenda.  
• Appeals to emotion, fear, or ideology more than to evidence.  
• Discourages scrutiny, marginalizes critics, or presents disagreement as immoral or irrational.  
• Often disguises itself as authoritative by mimicking scientific language or citing cherry-picked experts.

3. CRITERIA FOR DISTINGUISHING THE TWO  

3.1 Source credibility  
  – Affiliations: Universities, research institutes, and reputable journals tend to have stronger quality controls than anonymous blogs or politically funded think tanks.  
  – Track record: Does the source consistently publish accurate material? Do other experts cite it positively?

3.2 Evidence quality  
  – Study design: Randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and large cohort studies generally carry more weight than anecdotes or uncontrolled observations.  
  – Sample size & representativeness: Small or highly specific samples may not generalize.  
  – Reproducibility: Have independent groups obtained similar results?

3.3 Methodological transparency  
  – Are data, protocols, and statistical code available for inspection?  
  – Pre-registration: Was the study registered in advance to prevent data dredging?

3.4 Peer review and replication  
  – Publication venue: Is it a journal with rigorous peer review?  
  – Citations & follow-ups: Have other researchers reproduced or extended the findings?

3.5 Consensus and context  
  – Scientific consensus isn’t infallible, but when 90%+ of specialists agree, any dissenting claim requires extraordinary evidence.  
  – Does the claim fit within, modify, or overturn existing theory—and does the author explain how?

3.6 Language and tone  
  – Good science: cautious, acknowledges uncertainty (“may,” “suggests,” “confidence interval”).  
  – Propaganda: absolute statements (“proven,” “no doubt”), inflammatory adjectives, or moral framing (“only fools deny…”).

3.7 Data presentation and statistics  
  – Correct axes, no truncated scales that exaggerate differences.  
  – Complete data, not only the portion that supports a specific narrative.  
  – Proper statistical tests, adjustments for multiple comparisons, disclosure of negative results.

3.8 Funding and conflicts of interest  
  – Who paid for the study or the communication?  
  – Industry funding doesn’t automatically invalidate results, but transparency is essential.

3.9 Balance and limitations  
  – Good papers devote space to limitations and alternative interpretations.  
  – Propaganda downplays weaknesses or omits them altogether.

3.10 Logical fallacies and rhetorical tactics to watch for  
  – Cherry-picking, straw man, ad hominem, false equivalence, slippery slope, appeal to emotion, fear-mongering.

4. PRACTICAL STEP-BY-STEP EVALUATION  

Step 1: Identify the original source.  
Step 2: Check author credentials and affiliations.  
Step 3: Look for peer-reviewed publication or conference presentation.  
Step 4: Examine methodology (sample size, controls, blinding, statistical tests).  
Step 5: Search for corroboration: other studies, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses.  
Step 6: Inspect funding disclosures and potential conflicts.  
Step 7: Evaluate language for neutrality and acknowledgment of uncertainty.  
Step 8: Check whether reputable bodies (professional societies, CDC, WHO, IPCC, etc.) have weighed in.  
Step 9: Ask whether claims are falsifiable. If a claim is formulated so that nothing could disprove it, it is not scientific.  
Step 10: Apply critical thinking; avoid confirmation bias by deliberately seeking disconfirming evidence.

5. COMMON RED FLAGS  
• Dramatic, one-off “breakthroughs” announced via press release before peer review.  
• “Scientists don’t want you to know” or “They laughed at Galileo” narratives.  
• Heavy reliance on anecdotes or testimonials.  
• Selective referencing of outdated or low-quality studies.  
• Claims that hinge on conspiracy (“all journals are suppressing the truth”).  
• Graphics without axis labels or units.  
• Overuse of jargon to intimidate rather than clarify.

6. BRIEF EXAMPLES  

Example A: Smoking and lung cancer (good science)  
  – Decades of epidemiological studies, animal research, mechanistic understanding.  
  – Replication across continents.  
  – Transparent data, evolving consensus, Surgeon General reports.  

Example B: “Climate change is a hoax” flyer (propaganda)  
  – Selects one cold winter to “disprove” long-term warming trend.  
  – Omits decades of global temperature data and multiple lines of evidence.  
  – Uses derisive language, no peer-reviewed citations, often linked to undisclosed fossil fuel funding.

7. TOOLS AND RESOURCES  
• PubMed, Google Scholar: locate original studies.  
• Retraction Watch: check for retracted or disputed papers.  
• Cochrane Library: high-quality systematic reviews in health sciences.  
• Open Science Framework, Figshare: look for shared data and protocols.  
• Snopes, FactCheck.org, Climate Feedback, Health Feedback: expert fact-checking sites.  
• GraphCheck, Calling Bull*** (essay series and university course): tutorials on spotting statistical deception.

CONCLUSION  
Good science is reproducible, transparent, and self-correcting; propaganda is persuasive, opaque, and agenda-driven. By systematically checking sources, evidence, methods, and rhetoric—and by remaining aware of one’s own cognitive biases—you can usually tell the difference. Cultivating these habits protects not only personal decision-making but also the integrity of public discourse.
