Distinguishing good science from propaganda requires understanding fundamental differences in methodology, transparency, and intent. Here are key criteria to evaluate scientific information:

## Methodological Rigor

Good science follows established scientific methods including peer review, reproducibility, and systematic data collection [1]. Legitimate scientific studies clearly describe their methodology, sample sizes, control groups, and statistical analyses. Propaganda, by contrast, often presents selective data, anecdotes, or conclusions without supporting evidence [2].

## Source Credibility and Transparency

Reputable scientific work is published in peer-reviewed journals with editorial oversight and transparent review processes [3]. Authors disclose funding sources, potential conflicts of interest, and limitations of their research. Propaganda typically lacks these transparency measures and may come from sources with undisclosed financial or ideological motivations [4].

## Language and Presentation

Scientific literature uses precise, measured language that acknowledges uncertainty and limitations. Researchers typically present findings with appropriate caveats and discuss alternative explanations [1]. Propaganda often uses absolute statements, emotional appeals, and cherry-picked data to support predetermined conclusions [2].

## Consensus and Replication

Good science builds on previous work and undergoes replication by independent researchers. Scientific consensus emerges gradually through multiple studies using different approaches [5]. Propaganda often presents outlier studies as definitive proof while ignoring the broader body of evidence [4].

## Critical Evaluation Questions

When evaluating scientific claims, consider: Who conducted the research and who funded it? Has the work been peer-reviewed and replicated? Are the conclusions proportionate to the evidence presented? Does the source acknowledge limitations and uncertainty? Are alternative explanations considered [3]?

## Red Flags

Be wary of sources that: make extraordinary claims without extraordinary evidence, attack the scientific establishment rather than engaging with evidence, use testimonials instead of data, present complex issues as having simple solutions, or refuse to acknowledge any uncertainty in their conclusions [2][5].
