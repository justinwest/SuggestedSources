# How do you distinguish good science from propaganda?

Distinguishing good science from propaganda requires a critical examination of not only the information presented but also its underlying purpose, methodology, and the context in which it is shared. While good science is a rigorous, self-correcting process aimed at understanding the natural world, propaganda is a form of communication designed to influence beliefs and actions to serve a specific agenda [1, 2]. The line between them can be blurred when scientific findings are selectively used or distorted to support a predetermined conclusion.

Key distinctions can be made by evaluating the following areas:

**1. Methodology and Integrity**
Good science is defined by its commitment to the scientific method, which includes transparency, objectivity, and falsifiability. Its methods are designed to be scrutinized and replicated by others. In contrast, information presented as science can be propaganda if its methodology is fraudulent, biased, or designed to produce a specific outcome.

A stark example is the Stanford Prison Experiment. For decades, it was presented as a landmark scientific study demonstrating how situations can dictate human behavior. However, later analysis revealed that the experiment was a fraud. The lead researcher, Philip Zimbardo, did not act as a neutral observer but actively coached the "guards" to be cruel to achieve his desired narrative. This manipulation of methods and participants to fit a preconceived conclusion is a hallmark of propaganda masquerading as science [3].

**2. Purpose and Motivation**
The goal of science is to pursue knowledge and understanding, wherever the evidence may lead. Propaganda, however, begins with a conclusion and seeks to persuade an audience to adopt it. This is often done to advance a political, ideological, or commercial agenda [1, 2].

The work of Trofim Lysenko in the Soviet Union exemplifies this distinction. Lysenko promoted agricultural theories based on Marxist ideology rather than established principles of genetics, which he rejected. His motivation was not scientific discovery but aligning agricultural science with the political goals of the Soviet state. The state, in turn, elevated his work and suppressed all competing scientific thought, leading to disastrous famines [4]. Similarly, propaganda can operate by framing half-truths or real facts in a way that integrates an individual into a group or way of thinking, making them *want* to believe the narrative for social or psychological reasons [2].

**3. Treatment of Dissent and Skepticism**
A core strength of the scientific process is its embrace of skepticism, debate, and peer review. Disagreement and challenges to established theories are essential for scientific progress. Propaganda, on the other hand, seeks to create consensus and conformity by suppressing or silencing dissent.

Lysenkoism provides an extreme example, where geneticists who opposed Lysenko's theories were persecuted, imprisoned, or executed by the state [4]. On a different scale, the author of "NIH Staff Revolt Promotes Propaganda" argues that an internal effort by NIH staff to stop a study on the effectiveness of masking for COVID-19 was an attempt to shut down inquiry that might challenge a preferred narrative. The article posits that this impulse to prevent research rather than debate its results is a characteristic of propaganda, which aims to protect a dogma rather than seek truth [1].

**4. The Source of Authority**
In good science, authority is derived from evidence, rigorous methodology, and the consensus of experts who have vetted the work. It is a system built on merit and empirical support. In propaganda, authority is often derived from a political or institutional power structure that declares something to be true.

Lysenko's theories were not accepted because they withstood scientific scrutiny, but because they were endorsed and enforced by Joseph Stalin and the Communist Party [4]. This reliance on political authority over empirical evidence is a clear sign that a claim is rooted in propaganda, not science. Propaganda works by creating a totalizing environment where the message is reinforced by all official sources, making it difficult to question [2].

In conclusion, distinguishing good science from propaganda requires looking beyond the surface-level claims. One must ask critical questions: Was the methodology transparent and unbiased? [3] What is the primary purpose of the communication—to inform or to persuade? [1] How are dissenting views and contradictory evidence treated? [4] Is the authority of the claim based on evidence or on ideology? [4] While science can be complex and its findings sometimes uncertain, its foundational commitment to a process of open-ended inquiry stands in stark contrast to the closed, agenda-driven nature of propaganda [2].

    *   This essay contrasts two models of propaganda. The first is a conventional top-down model of elites disseminating lies. The second, based on the work of Jacques Ellul, presents propaganda as a more subtle process of integrating individuals into a worldview, often using facts and half-truths to create a self-reinforcing social reality that people want to belong to.
