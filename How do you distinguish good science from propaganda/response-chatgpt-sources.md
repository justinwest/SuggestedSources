# How do you distinguish good science from propaganda?

Distinguishing good science from propaganda is less about the subject matter than about the intentions, incentives, and methods behind a claim.  Below is a practical framework that combines classic norms of scientific inquiry with the warning signs that historians, philosophers, and journalists have found in past failures such as Lysenkoism and the Stanford Prison Experiment.

────────────────────
1.  PURPOSE: Truth-seeking vs. persuasion
────────────────────
• Good science is primarily an organized search for accurate explanations.   
• Propaganda is communication designed to promote a political, commercial, or ideological goal; accuracy is secondary to impact.  One way to see the difference is to ask: “If new evidence overturned this claim, would its promoters willingly change their minds?”  If the answer is “no,” you are probably facing propaganda rather than science [2].

────────────────────
2.  OPENNESS OF METHODS AND DATA
────────────────────
• Science: experimental design, raw data, and statistical code are made public (or at least available on request) so that anyone can audit or replicate the work.  
• Propaganda: methods are kept vague, or the audience is asked to “trust the experts.”  In the NIH training-video controversy, staff objected that the agency was circulating talking points without disclosing the underlying evidence—an example of institutional “propaganda creep” inside a scientific organization [1].

Checklist questions  
① Are the full data and protocols available?  
② Is the study preregistered or at least precisely described?  

────────────────────
3.  FALSIFIABILITY & REPLICATION
────────────────────
• Science welcomes the possibility of being proven wrong.  Findings should survive independent replication, preferably by critics.  
• Propaganda relies on claims that cannot be tested or that are shielded from serious replication attempts.  The Stanford Prison Experiment was rhetorically powerful, but it involved coaching of participants, hiding of contrary evidence, and has failed every attempt at independent replication—features typical of persuasive storytelling, not rigorous science [3].

Checklist questions  
③ Have independent groups reproduced the result?  
④ Could a clear observation conceivably prove the claim false?  

────────────────────
4.  HANDLING OF UNCERTAINTY
────────────────────
• Science quantifies error bars, confidence intervals, and alternative interpretations.  
• Propaganda speaks in absolutes (“the science is settled,” “there is zero doubt”) or hides uncertainty because admitting it might weaken the rhetorical punch.  

────────────────────
5.  ATTITUDE TOWARD CRITICISM
────────────────────
• Science treats criticism as a path to improvement; journals publish letters, rival labs can obtain grants to check results.  
• Propaganda delegitimizes critics (“deniers,” “enemies of the people”), uses ad-hominem attacks, or suppresses dissent.  In Stalin’s USSR, Trofim Lysenko labeled geneticists who questioned his ideas as enemies of the state; their imprisonment removed the very mechanism—open debate—that keeps science honest, leading to catastrophic crop failures [4].

Checklist questions  
⑤ Are critics given access to the data and a chance to respond?  
⑥ Do funding agencies or political actors punish dissent?  

────────────────────
6.  INCENTIVES & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
────────────────────
• Ask who benefits if the claim is accepted.  Undeclared financial or ideological interests tilt work toward propaganda.  Even within public institutions, career or reputational incentives can push scientists toward advocacy rather than precision [1].

────────────────────
7.  RHETORICAL SIGNATURES
────────────────────
Signs you are dealing with propaganda rather than science:  
• Emotional language, slogans, memes, or celebrities as spokespeople.  
• Cherry-picked anecdotes presented as definitive proof.  
• Graphs or statistics without context or error margins.  
• Appeals to authority in place of empirical detail.  

────────────────────
8.  APPLYING THE FRAMEWORK: A MINI-DIAGNOSTIC
────────────────────
A. Examine the primary study (not just press releases).  
B. Run through the six checklist pairs above (data access, replication, etc.).  
C. Weigh the conflicts of interest.  
D. Look for independent replications or meta-analyses.  
E. Observe how the authors talk to critics: do they share data or issue press attacks?  

If a claim passes these filters, it is probably “good science” (though still provisional).  If it fails several, it is likely propaganda or at least low-quality science.

────────────────────
9.  Why the Distinction Matters
────────────────────
Errors in ordinary science are self-correcting; propaganda that masquerades as science can deform entire policy domains for decades.  Lysenkoism reduced Soviet wheat yields, caused famine, and set genetics research back a generation [4].  The Stanford Prison narrative long distorted public and academic understanding of human behavior in institutions [3].  Learning to spot the difference is therefore essential for voters, policymakers, and scientists themselves.

────────────────────
10.  Bottom line
────────────────────
Good science is transparent, testable, and self-correcting; propaganda is opaque, absolute, and self-protective.  Use the methods/attitude/incentive tests above, watch for the rhetorical red flags, and insist on replication before you grant a claim the status of trustworthy knowledge.
