### Understanding Extralegal Pressure
Extralegal pressure refers to actions by government entities that influence corporate behavior without relying on formal legal mechanisms, such as legislation, regulations, or court orders. These can include informal threats, public shaming, selective enforcement, or leveraging regulatory oversight to encourage compliance. Such tactics are often controversial, as they may skirt due process and raise concerns about government overreach. Below, I outline several documented examples from U.S. history, drawing from various administrations to provide a balanced view. These examples are based on investigative reports, court cases, and scholarly analyses.

### Examples of Extralegal Pressure

1. **Operation Choke Point (2013–2017)**: Under the Obama administration, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) initiated this program to target industries deemed "high-risk," such as payday lenders, firearms dealers, and tobacco sellers. Rather than passing new laws, regulators pressured banks to terminate relationships with these businesses by labeling them as reputational risks, threatening heightened scrutiny or penalties if banks continued services. This effectively "choked" off financial access without formal charges or trials. Critics argued it violated due process, leading to congressional investigations and the program's eventual termination [1][2].

2. **Pressure on Social Media Companies for Content Moderation (2021–Present)**: The Biden administration has been accused of exerting extralegal influence on platforms like Facebook (Meta), Twitter (now X), and YouTube to censor or flag content related to COVID-19 misinformation, election integrity, and other topics. Communications revealed through lawsuits, such as Missouri v. Biden (now Murthy v. Missouri), showed White House officials emailing companies with demands to remove posts, sometimes implying regulatory consequences like antitrust actions or changes to Section 230 protections if they did not comply. This was ruled by a federal judge in 2023 as likely violating the First Amendment, though the case is ongoing [3][4].

3. **Threats to Corporations During the Trump Administration (2016–2020)**: President Trump used public statements and informal threats to influence corporate decisions. For instance, in 2016, he pressured Carrier Corporation (a subsidiary of United Technologies) to reverse plans to move jobs from Indiana to Mexico by threatening tariffs, withholding federal contracts, and public shaming via Twitter. Carrier partially relented, keeping some jobs in the U.S. Similarly, Trump targeted companies like Amazon, alleging bias and threatening antitrust scrutiny or postal rate hikes, reportedly in retaliation for critical coverage by The Washington Post (owned by Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos). These actions were criticized as abusing executive power without legal basis [5][6].

4. **Environmental and Financial Pressures on Energy Companies (Various Administrations)**: The U.S. government has used extralegal tactics to push corporations toward environmental goals. For example, under the Biden administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other agencies have encouraged banks to divest from fossil fuels through informal guidance and "climate stress tests," without formal rulemaking. This echoes earlier efforts, such as the Obama-era pressure on banks to avoid financing coal projects via regulatory "guidance" that carried implicit threats of enforcement actions. Critics, including some in Congress, have labeled this as "backdoor regulation" that circumvents legislative processes [7][8].

5. **Historical Example: World War II-Era Industrial Pressures (1940s)**: During World War II, the Roosevelt administration used extralegal means to compel corporations to support the war effort. For instance, the War Production Board informally threatened companies like Ford Motor Company with resource rationing or public condemnation if they did not prioritize military production over civilian goods. While some actions were backed by emergency powers, many relied on persuasion and implied repercussions rather than explicit laws, setting a precedent for postwar government-corporate relations [9].

These examples illustrate a pattern across administrations, often justified as necessary for public policy goals but criticized for potentially infringing on corporate autonomy and constitutional rights. The effectiveness of such pressures varies, sometimes leading to compliance but also to legal challenges and public backlash.
