### Understanding Extralegal Pressure

Extralegal pressure refers to actions by government entities that influence corporate behavior through informal means, such as threats, persuasion, or indirect incentives, rather than through formal legal processes like legislation, regulations, or court orders. These tactics can blur the line between legitimate government advocacy and coercive overreach, potentially raising concerns about due process, free speech, and regulatory fairness [1]. While such pressures are not inherently illegal, they can be controversial when they circumvent established legal channels. Below, I outline several notable examples from U.S. history, drawing on documented cases involving various administrations and agencies. These examples span financial services, technology, environmental policy, and public health.

### Examples of Extralegal Pressure

1. **Operation Choke Point (2013–2017)**: Initiated by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) under the Obama administration, this program aimed to combat fraud by pressuring banks to terminate relationships with certain "high-risk" industries, such as payday lenders, firearms dealers, and tobacco sellers. Instead of pursuing formal regulations or prosecutions, regulators used informal guidance, subpoenas, and reputational threats to encourage banks to "de-risk" these clients, effectively cutting off their access to financial services. Critics argued this constituted extralegal pressure, as it lacked statutory authority and targeted legal businesses without due process [1][2]. The program was discontinued in 2017 amid congressional scrutiny, but similar tactics have been alleged in other sectors.

2. **Jawboning Social Media Companies for Content Moderation (2020–Present)**: The Biden administration has faced accusations of using extralegal pressure on tech giants like Meta (Facebook), Twitter (now X), and Google to censor or suppress content related to COVID-19 misinformation, election integrity, and other topics. This "jawboning"—informal persuasion or threats—allegedly involved White House officials emailing or meeting with executives to demand content removals, with implied threats of antitrust actions or regulatory scrutiny if companies did not comply. The Supreme Court case *Murthy v. Missouri* (formerly *Missouri v. Biden*) highlighted emails where officials urged platforms to "do more" against misinformation, raising First Amendment concerns. While the Court ruled in 2024 that plaintiffs lacked standing, it did not dismiss the underlying jawboning claims [3][4]. Similar pressures occurred under previous administrations, such as the Trump-era requests to social media firms regarding election-related content.

3. **Environmental and Climate-Related Pressures on Energy Companies (Various Eras)**: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other agencies have used informal tactics to push corporations toward greener practices without formal rulemaking. For instance, during the Obama administration, the EPA's "Sue and Settle" strategy involved colluding with environmental groups to enter consent decrees that imposed new standards on industries like coal and oil, bypassing public comment periods [5]. More recently, the Biden administration has encouraged financial institutions to adopt climate risk assessments through non-binding guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with critics claiming this creates de facto mandates via regulatory threats [6]. These actions influence corporate investment decisions, such as divesting from fossil fuels, without explicit legal requirements.

4. **Antitrust Threats to Influence Tech and Media Behavior (2010s–Present)**: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and DOJ have allegedly used the specter of antitrust investigations to extract concessions from corporations. For example, during the Trump administration, reports emerged of White House pressure on the DOJ to scrutinize mergers like AT&T-Time Warner, partly to punish CNN (a Time Warner subsidiary) for perceived anti-Trump coverage [7]. Similarly, the Biden FTC, under Chair Lina Khan, has been accused of using informal warnings and prolonged reviews to deter mergers or force policy changes in Big Tech, such as data privacy practices at companies like Amazon and Google, without always filing formal charges [8]. This form of pressure leverages the uncertainty and costs of investigations to influence corporate strategy.

5. **Public Health Mandates During the COVID-19 Pandemic (2020–2022)**: The Biden administration employed extralegal tactics to encourage private employers to implement vaccine mandates. While the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) attempted a formal rule (later struck down by the Supreme Court), President Biden publicly urged corporations to "step up" and mandate vaccines, with implied threats of federal contract losses or regulatory scrutiny for non-compliance [9]. Companies like United Airlines and Tyson Foods adopted mandates following these calls, and emails revealed coordination between the White House and business leaders. Critics viewed this as coercive jawboning, especially since it targeted private entities without legislative backing [4].

These examples illustrate how extralegal pressures can achieve policy goals efficiently but often spark debates over government overreach. They are not exhaustive, and similar tactics have been used in areas like national security (e.g., pressuring telecoms for surveillance cooperation post-9/11) [10]. Legal challenges, such as those in *Murthy v. Missouri*, continue to test the boundaries of such actions.
