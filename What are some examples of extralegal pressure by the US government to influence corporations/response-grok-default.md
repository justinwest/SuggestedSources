### Understanding Extralegal Pressure
Extralegal pressure refers to actions by government entities that influence corporate behavior without relying on formal legal processes, such as lawsuits, regulations, or statutes. These can include informal threats, persuasion, public shaming, or leveraging regulatory oversight to encourage compliance. While not illegal per se, such tactics often raise concerns about overreach, free speech, and due process. They are sometimes called "jawboning," where officials use their authority to pressure private entities indirectly [1]. Below, I outline several historical and contemporary examples of extralegal pressure exerted by the US government on corporations, drawing from documented cases across administrations.

### Examples of Extralegal Pressure

1. **Operation Choke Point (2013–2017)**: Initiated by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) under the Obama administration, this program targeted banks providing services to industries deemed "high-risk," such as payday lenders, firearms dealers, and tobacco sellers. Rather than enacting new laws, regulators pressured banks through informal guidance, heightened scrutiny, and threats of enforcement actions, leading many banks to terminate relationships with these businesses to avoid regulatory hassle. Critics argued this bypassed Congress and unfairly stigmatized legal industries [2]. The program was eventually discontinued amid bipartisan backlash, but it exemplified how regulatory agencies could use extralegal means to influence corporate decisions.

2. **Pressure on Social Media Companies for Content Moderation (2010s–2020s)**: Various administrations have engaged in "jawboning" to influence tech giants like Meta (Facebook), Twitter (now X), and Google. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Biden administration officials, including White House staff and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, repeatedly contacted platforms to urge the removal or suppression of content deemed misinformation on vaccines and elections. This included emails and meetings where officials suggested potential regulatory consequences if companies did not comply [3]. The Supreme Court case *Murthy v. Missouri* (2024) addressed these actions, with plaintiffs alleging they violated the First Amendment by coercing private censorship. Similar pressures occurred under the Trump administration regarding election-related content, highlighting a bipartisan pattern of informal influence over corporate speech policies.

3. **Informal Antitrust Threats Against Tech Companies (2010s–Present)**: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and DOJ have used veiled threats of antitrust investigations to sway corporate behavior without formal charges. For example, in 2021, FTC Chair Lina Khan (under the Biden administration) publicly criticized Amazon's business practices and reportedly pressured the company through backchannel communications to alter its algorithms and book rankings, particularly for titles critical of vaccines or government policies [4]. Historically, the Nixon administration (1969–1974) used antitrust threats to pressure media companies like ABC and CBS to soften critical coverage, as revealed in White House tapes [1]. These tactics leverage the fear of costly probes to encourage self-regulation, often without due process.

4. **Environmental and Energy Sector Pressures (2000s–Present)**: Administrations have used public statements and informal regulatory signals to influence energy companies. During the Obama era, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) engaged in "sue and settle" tactics and public campaigns that pressured oil and gas firms to adopt greener practices, sometimes bypassing formal rulemaking [5]. More recently, the Biden administration has urged banks and investors to divest from fossil fuels through speeches and guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), without new legislation. This "whole-of-government" approach has led corporations like BlackRock to adjust portfolios amid fears of reputational damage or future regulations, though it has faced legal challenges for overstepping authority [5].

5. **Financial Sector Influence During Crises (2008 Financial Crisis)**: In response to the 2008 crisis, the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve applied extralegal pressure on banks to participate in bailout programs like the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Officials, including Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, held closed-door meetings where they strongly encouraged (some say coerced) executives from firms like Bank of America and Citigroup to accept funds and merge with failing institutions, using implied threats of regulatory scrutiny [6]. While framed as voluntary, participants later described it as unavoidable pressure, illustrating how emergency contexts amplify extralegal tactics.

These examples demonstrate a range of methods, from regulatory nudges to direct communications, often justified as protecting public interest but criticized for undermining corporate autonomy and legal norms. Such pressures can be effective because corporations fear reputational harm, regulatory retaliation, or loss of government contracts [1].
