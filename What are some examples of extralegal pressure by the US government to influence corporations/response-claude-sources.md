The US government has employed various forms of extralegal pressure to influence corporate behavior, often working through informal channels rather than formal regulation or legislation. These tactics, sometimes called "jawboning" or moral suasion, involve government officials using their influence to encourage or discourage specific business practices.

## Financial Services and Banking Pressure

One of the most documented examples is **Operation Choke Point**, a coordinated effort by federal agencies to pressure banks into severing relationships with certain industries deemed "high-risk." Under this program, banks were effectively coerced to deny services to payday lenders, gun dealers, and other legal businesses [1][7]. The operation involved banking regulators conducting intensive examinations and applying informal pressure on financial institutions to cut ties with these industries, even when the businesses were operating legally [7].

A similar pattern has emerged in the cryptocurrency sector, with claims of "Operation Choke Point 2.0." The FDIC has faced criticism for allegedly pressuring banks to limit their crypto-related services through informal guidance and regulatory pressure rather than explicit rules [6]. This approach has been characterized as creating uncertainty in the banking sector about serving cryptocurrency businesses.

## Social Media Content Moderation

The government has also applied pressure to social media companies regarding content moderation policies. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that the Biden administration pressured the company to censor COVID-19 content, with officials expressing frustration when Meta didn't comply with their requests [4]. This pressure campaign was part of broader government efforts to influence how social media platforms handle controversial content.

The **Twitter Files** revelations further exposed how government agencies, including the FBI and other federal departments, maintained regular communication with Twitter to flag content for potential removal or restriction [10]. A federal judge later restricted White House communications with social media companies, finding that such pressure may constitute government censorship in violation of the First Amendment [5].

## Defense Contracting and Employment

During election periods and times of fiscal uncertainty, the government has pressured defense contractors regarding layoff announcements. In 2012, the Obama administration successfully convinced Lockheed Martin to delay issuing federally-required layoff notices that would have been sent just days before the presidential election [11]. The administration argued that such notices were premature given ongoing budget negotiations, though critics viewed this as politically motivated interference [13].

## Financial Investigations and Targeting

The **IRS targeting controversy** demonstrated how government agencies can use their regulatory authority to apply disproportionate scrutiny to certain groups. The IRS admitted to targeting conservative political organizations applying for tax-exempt status, subjecting them to enhanced scrutiny and delays that effectively hampered their operations during crucial political periods [8].

## Corporate Services and Financial Pressure

Following the WikiLeaks document releases, several major corporations ceased providing services to the organization after apparent government pressure. Companies like Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal suspended services to WikiLeaks, effectively creating a financial blockade that demonstrated how government influence can extend through corporate intermediaries to restrict controversial organizations [3].

## Trade and Economic Leverage

Presidents have also used the threat of regulatory action or government contracts to influence corporate decisions. The Trump administration's negotiations with Carrier to prevent moving jobs to Mexico exemplified how government officials can use various forms of leverage—including tax incentives, regulatory threats, and public pressure—to influence corporate behavior [12].

These examples illustrate a pattern where government agencies and officials use informal pressure, regulatory uncertainty, and implied threats rather than explicit legal mandates to achieve policy objectives. This approach allows the government to influence corporate behavior while maintaining plausible deniability about direct coercion, though it raises significant questions about the boundaries between legitimate government influence and improper interference with private business operations.
