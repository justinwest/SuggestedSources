The US government has employed various forms of extralegal pressure to influence corporate behavior across multiple sectors and administrations. These tactics operate in legal gray areas, often using regulatory authority, informal communications, or implied threats to achieve policy objectives without formal legal proceedings.

## Financial Sector Targeting

**Operation Choke Point** represents one of the most documented examples of systematic extralegal pressure. Under the Obama administration, the Department of Justice and banking regulators pressured financial institutions to terminate relationships with legal but disfavored businesses, including payday lenders, firearms dealers, and adult entertainment companies [1][7]. Banks received guidance suggesting these industries posed "reputational risk," leading many to sever ties with legitimate businesses to avoid regulatory scrutiny [1].

The program's reach extended beyond its original scope. Banking regulators sent letters and conducted examinations that effectively discouraged banks from serving entire industries, even when those businesses operated legally [7]. This created a de facto boycott without formal legal action or due process.

Similar tactics have reportedly been used against cryptocurrency companies in what critics call "Operation Choke Point 2.0." Banking regulators have allegedly pressured financial institutions to limit services to crypto businesses, with the FDIC facing particular scrutiny for its communications with banks regarding digital asset companies [6].

## Content Moderation and Social Media

Government pressure on social media platforms to moderate content represents another significant area of extralegal influence. Mark Zuckerberg revealed that the Biden administration "repeatedly pressured" Meta to censor COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, which the company later regretted removing [4]. This pressure was part of broader government efforts to influence online speech during the pandemic.

The "Twitter Files" revelations exposed extensive communication between government agencies and Twitter (now X) regarding content moderation decisions [10]. These documents showed how federal agencies regularly flagged content for potential removal, blurring the lines between government influence and private platform policies.

A federal judge found this relationship so problematic that they issued an injunction restricting White House communications with social media companies, determining that government officials had likely violated First Amendment rights by pressuring platforms to remove content [5].

## Defense Contracting and Employment

The Obama and Trump administrations both used informal pressure tactics regarding defense industry employment decisions. In 2012, the White House convinced Lockheed Martin to delay issuing federally-required layoff notices until after the presidential election, despite legal obligations under the WARN Act [11]. The administration reportedly promised to cover any legal costs resulting from the delay [14].

Similarly, the Trump administration pressured companies like Carrier (United Technologies) to reverse decisions to move manufacturing overseas, using a combination of tax incentives and implied threats regarding future government contracts [12][13].

## Tax Enforcement as Political Tool

The IRS targeting controversy demonstrated how tax enforcement powers could be used for political purposes. The agency subjected conservative political groups to enhanced scrutiny when applying for tax-exempt status, creating significant delays and requesting extensive documentation not required of other organizations [8]. This represented a form of bureaucratic pressure that effectively limited these groups' activities without formal legal action.

## Corporate Speech and WikiLeaks

Following WikiLeaks' publication of classified documents, major corporations like Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and Amazon terminated services to the organization without legal requirements to do so [3]. While companies claimed independent decision-making, the coordinated nature of these actions and their timing suggested government influence, effectively creating a financial blockade against WikiLeaks.

These examples illustrate how federal agencies and officials can leverage regulatory authority, informal communications, and implied consequences to influence corporate behavior outside formal legal channels. Such tactics raise significant concerns about due process, separation of powers, and the potential for government overreach in a market economy.
