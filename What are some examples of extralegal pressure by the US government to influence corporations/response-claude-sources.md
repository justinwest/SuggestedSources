The US government has employed various forms of extralegal pressure to influence corporate behavior across multiple sectors and administrations. These efforts often operate in legal gray areas, using regulatory agencies and government influence to achieve policy goals without formal legal proceedings.

## Financial Sector Pressure

**Operation Choke Point** represents one of the most documented examples of extralegal government pressure on corporations. Launched during the Obama administration, this Department of Justice initiative pressured banks to terminate relationships with legal but politically disfavored businesses [1][7]. The operation targeted industries including payday lenders, firearms dealers, and adult entertainment businesses by encouraging financial institutions to view these sectors as high-risk [7].

Banks received informal guidance suggesting they should avoid doing business with these industries, despite their legal status. As reported, banks told payday lenders to "quit the business or we'll close your account," demonstrating how government pressure translated into corporate action without formal legal proceedings [1]. A House Oversight Committee investigation later characterized this as the DOJ "secretly pressured banks to cut ties with legal businesses" [7].

Similar concerns have emerged regarding cryptocurrency businesses, with some industry participants alleging an "Operation Choke Point 2.0" targeting crypto companies through banking pressure [6]. The FDIC has faced scrutiny over letters that allegedly discouraged banks from serving cryptocurrency clients [6].

## Social Media Content Moderation

Government pressure on social media platforms represents another significant area of extralegal influence. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that the Biden administration "pressured Meta to censor COVID-19 content," including humor and satire, during the pandemic [4]. Zuckerberg described feeling that the administration was "frustrated" when Meta didn't agree to remove certain content, creating pressure to comply with government preferences [4].

This pressure became the subject of legal challenges, with a federal judge restricting White House communications with social media companies over concerns about government overreach in content moderation [5]. The court found evidence that government officials had improperly pressured platforms to remove or suppress content [5].

The Twitter Files revelations further documented extensive communication between government agencies and social media platforms regarding content moderation decisions [10]. These documents showed regular contact between federal agencies and Twitter executives about specific posts and accounts, raising questions about the boundary between government influence and private platform policies [10].

## Tax Agency Targeting

The IRS targeting controversy demonstrated how tax enforcement could be used as a form of extralegal pressure. The agency acknowledged that it had subjected conservative political groups applying for tax-exempt status to additional scrutiny based on their names or political themes [8]. This selective enforcement created a chilling effect on political organizing without formal legal proceedings [8].

## Pressure on Financial Services

During the WikiLeaks controversy, major financial companies including Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal suspended services to the organization following government criticism and informal pressure, despite no formal legal prohibition on such transactions [3]. This demonstrated how government disapproval could translate into corporate action through reputational and regulatory concerns [3].

## Cryptocurrency and Banking

Recent allegations suggest ongoing pressure on cryptocurrency businesses through banking relationships. Industry participants have claimed that regulatory agencies have discouraged banks from serving crypto clients through informal guidance and regulatory pressure, effectively limiting access to financial services without formal prohibition [2][6].

These examples illustrate various mechanisms through which the US government has exerted extralegal pressure on corporations: regulatory guidance that discourages certain business relationships, informal communications expressing government preferences, selective enforcement of existing regulations, and the use of reputational pressure to influence corporate decision-making. While these tactics often avoid formal legal proceedings, they can effectively achieve policy goals by leveraging the government's regulatory authority and the private sector's desire to maintain good relationships with federal agencies.
