The US government has employed various forms of extralegal pressure to influence corporate behavior, using regulatory agencies, informal communications, and economic leverage to achieve policy goals without formal legal mandates. These tactics, sometimes called "jawboning" or "moral suasion," operate in gray areas between formal regulation and private sector autonomy.

## Operation Choke Point and Financial Services

One of the most documented examples is Operation Choke Point, a Department of Justice initiative that pressured banks to terminate relationships with legal businesses deemed "high-risk." [1][2] The program targeted industries including payday lenders, firearms dealers, and other businesses by encouraging financial institutions to close their accounts or deny services. Banks were warned that serving these industries could result in increased regulatory scrutiny, effectively forcing many legal businesses out of the banking system. [1]

A similar pattern has emerged in cryptocurrency regulation, with claims of "Operation Choke Point 2.0" where crypto companies report difficulty accessing banking services following informal government pressure on financial institutions. [3] The FDIC has faced scrutiny for letters that allegedly discouraged banks from providing services to crypto-related businesses without explicit regulatory prohibitions. [3]

## Social Media Content Moderation

Government pressure on social media platforms represents another significant area of extralegal influence. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that the Biden administration pressured the company to censor COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, with officials expressing frustration when Meta didn't comply with their requests. [4] 

The Twitter Files disclosures and subsequent litigation revealed extensive government communications with social media companies regarding content moderation decisions. [5] A federal judge found this pressure so concerning that they issued an injunction restricting White House communications with social media companies, though this was later modified by higher courts. [5] These cases illustrate how government agencies used informal pressure rather than formal regulations to influence platform policies.

## Defense Contracting and Labor Relations

The defense industry has experienced notable government pressure regarding employment decisions. In 2012, the Obama administration asked Lockheed Martin and other defense contractors to delay issuing layoff notices that would have been required under the WARN Act, effectively asking companies to potentially violate federal labor law to avoid pre-election political consequences. [6][7] The administration reportedly assured contractors that any legal costs from failing to provide required notices would be covered by the government.

## Tax Administration as Pressure Tool

The IRS targeting controversy demonstrated how tax administration can become a tool of extralegal pressure. [8] Conservative and Tea Party groups faced prolonged delays and intensive scrutiny in their applications for tax-exempt status, with investigations revealing that these groups were systematically targeted based on their political orientation rather than neutral criteria.

## Presidential Influence on Corporate Decisions

Individual presidents have used their platforms to pressure specific companies on business decisions. Donald Trump's intervention to prevent Carrier from moving jobs to Mexico exemplified direct presidential pressure on corporate operations, using a combination of public attention, potential policy changes, and negotiated incentives. [9] Such interventions demonstrate how high-profile government attention can influence corporate decision-making even without formal regulatory action.

## Legal and Constitutional Concerns

The Supreme Court case National Rifle Association of America v. Vullo established important precedents regarding the limits of government pressure on private entities. [10] The case addressed when informal government pressure becomes unconstitutional coercion, particularly regarding First Amendment rights and the boundaries between legitimate regulation and improper government influence.

These examples illustrate how government agencies and officials use regulatory uncertainty, public pressure, and informal communications to influence corporate behavior without formal legal mandates. While such techniques can be effective policy tools, they raise significant questions about due process, regulatory transparency, and the appropriate limits of government power in a market economy.
