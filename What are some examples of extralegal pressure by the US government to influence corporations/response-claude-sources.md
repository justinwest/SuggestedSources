Based on the provided sources, there are several notable examples of extralegal pressure by the US government to influence corporations across different sectors and administrations.

## Financial Services and Operation Choke Point

One of the most documented examples is "Operation Choke Point," a Department of Justice initiative that secretly pressured banks to terminate relationships with legal businesses the government considered objectionable [7]. This program particularly targeted payday lenders, with banks telling these businesses to "quit the business or we'll close your account" [1]. The House Oversight Committee found that the DOJ used informal pressure rather than formal legal action to achieve these outcomes [7].

A similar pattern has emerged in the cryptocurrency sector, with claims of "Operation Choke Point 2.0." The FDIC has been accused of pressuring banks to limit services to crypto companies, leading to complaints from major players like Coinbase [6]. This represents an extension of government pressure tactics into emerging financial technologies.

## Social Media Content Moderation

Government pressure on social media platforms represents another significant category. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg publicly stated that the Biden administration pressured his company to censor certain COVID-19 content [4]. This pressure became so concerning that a federal judge issued restrictions on White House communications with social media companies [5].

The "Twitter Files" revelations also documented extensive government coordination with social media platforms regarding content moderation decisions [10]. These examples demonstrate how administrations have used informal channels to influence corporate speech policies.

## Corporate Operational Decisions

The government has also applied pressure to influence major corporate operational decisions. In 2012, the White House successfully requested that Lockheed Martin drop plans to issue layoff notices before an election, despite legal requirements under the WARN Act [11]. This represents direct political interference in corporate employment decisions.

Similarly, President Trump personally intervened to pressure Carrier and United Technologies regarding their plans to move jobs to Mexico [12][13]. While initially presented as successful, subsequent reporting revealed the limited long-term effectiveness of this pressure [13].

## Internet Infrastructure and WikiLeaks

During the WikiLeaks controversy, government pressure led multiple corporations including Amazon, PayPal, and Visa to terminate services to the organization, demonstrating how informal pressure can effectively restrict internet speech without formal legal action [3].

## Tax Administration

The IRS targeting controversy involved the agency subjecting conservative political organizations to heightened scrutiny for tax-exempt status, representing government pressure through selective enforcement of tax regulations [8].

## Legal Framework and Mechanisms

These examples illustrate what scholars call "moral suasion" or "jawboning" - informal government pressure on private entities to achieve policy goals without formal regulation [15]. This approach allows administrations to influence corporate behavior while avoiding the formal legal processes typically required for government action.

The Supreme Court case NRA v. Vullo established some legal boundaries around when such pressure becomes unconstitutional, though the line between permissible persuasion and illegal coercion remains contested [16].
