Extralegal pressure by the US government on corporations refers to informal or indirect methods of influence that go beyond formal legal processes, such as threats of regulatory scrutiny, moral suasion (also known as "jawboning"), or leveraging government relationships to encourage specific behaviors. These tactics can include verbal persuasion, implied threats, or coordinated actions with regulators to achieve policy goals without explicit legislation or court orders [15]. While sometimes defended as legitimate oversight or "nudge theory" to guide behavior [16], critics argue they infringe on corporate autonomy and free speech, as seen in cases like *NRA v. Vullo*, where the Supreme Court ruled that such pressures could violate the First Amendment if they coerce action [17]. Below, I outline key examples drawn from historical and recent instances, categorized for clarity. These are based on the suggested sources, supplemented where necessary for completeness with additional reputable references (e.g., for context on WikiLeaks pressures).

### 1. Financial Sector Pressures (e.g., Operation Choke Point and Crypto-Related Actions)
The US Department of Justice (DOJ) and banking regulators have used informal pressures to encourage banks to sever ties with certain industries deemed "high-risk," even if those businesses operate legally. This approach, dubbed "Operation Choke Point" under the Obama administration, involved regulators like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and DOJ subtly threatening banks with heightened scrutiny or account closures if they continued serving targeted sectors [7][9].

- **Payday Lenders and Other "High-Risk" Businesses**: In 2013-2014, the DOJ pressured banks to terminate accounts of payday lenders, gun sellers, and other legal but controversial businesses by labeling them as fraud risks. Banks received informal warnings that failure to comply could lead to regulatory penalties or loss of FDIC insurance. This led to widespread account closures, as reported in investigations [1][7][9].
  
- **Cryptocurrency Firms ("Operation Choke Point 2.0")**: Similar tactics resurfaced under the Biden administration, with claims that the FDIC and other regulators informally discouraged banks from serving crypto companies. For instance, Coinbase highlighted FDIC letters urging banks to pause crypto-related activities, amid allegations of coordinated de-banking to stifle the industry [2][6]. This has been criticized as an extralegal means to regulate without formal rules.

### 2. Content Moderation and Censorship on Social Media Platforms
The US government has exerted pressure on tech companies to moderate content, often through direct communications or implied threats of antitrust scrutiny or regulatory changes. This form of jawboning has been challenged in courts, with a 2023 ruling limiting White House communications with social media firms to prevent coercive influence [5].

- **COVID-19 Content on Meta (Facebook)**: In 2021, senior Biden administration officials repeatedly pressured Meta to censor or remove COVID-19-related posts, including humor and misinformation, by threatening adverse policy actions if the company did not comply. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg later described this as "wrong" and regretted yielding [4].

- **Twitter (Now X) and Broader Social Media Influence**: The "Twitter Files" revealed extensive FBI and White House communications with Twitter executives to flag and suppress content related to elections, Hunter Biden, and COVID-19. This included weekly meetings and requests that bypassed formal channels, leading to content removals [10]. A federal judge in 2023 restricted such interactions, citing risks of government-coerced censorship [5].

### 3. Pressures on Defense and Manufacturing Firms for Employment Decisions
Presidents have used personal interventions and moral suasion to influence corporate layoffs or offshoring, often tied to political optics rather than legal mandates.

- **Lockheed Martin Layoff Notices**: In 2012, the Obama White House requested that Lockheed Martin delay issuing layoff notices required under the WARN Act, ahead of sequestration cuts and the presidential election. The company complied, avoiding politically damaging announcements, despite no legal obligation to do so [11][14].

- **Carrier Corporation Job Retention**: President-elect Donald Trump in 2016 personally negotiated with Carrier (a subsidiary of United Technologies) to reverse plans to move jobs to Mexico. Through public threats of tariffs and loss of government contracts, combined with tax incentives, Trump influenced the company to retain some jobs in Indiana. However, many jobs were still offshored later [12][13].

### 4. Other Notable Examples
- **WikiLeaks and Payment Processors**: In 2010, following WikiLeaks' release of classified documents, US officials, including then-Sen. Joe Lieberman, pressured companies like PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard to cut off financial services to WikiLeaks without a court order. This informal blockade limited the organization's operations, highlighting the limits of internet free speech [3].

- **IRS Targeting of Nonprofit Organizations**: During the Obama era, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) applied extralegal scrutiny to conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status, delaying approvals and demanding excessive information. This was deemed politically motivated, leading to congressional investigations and apologies from the IRS [8].

- **NRA Insurance Case**: While involving a state official, this federal precedent (upheld by the Supreme Court in 2024) illustrates similar tactics: New York's financial regulator Maria Vullo urged insurers and banks to sever ties with the National Rifle Association (NRA) by implying regulatory repercussions, which the Court found could constitute unconstitutional coercion [17].

These examples illustrate a pattern where government entities use informal leverage—such as regulatory threats or direct appeals—to influence corporate decisions. Proponents view them as efficient policy tools [15][16], but critics, including congressional reports, argue they undermine due process and enable abuse [7]. For further reading on jawboning's legal boundaries, see the Supreme Court's decision in *Murthy v. Missouri* (2024), which addressed similar social media pressures [18].
