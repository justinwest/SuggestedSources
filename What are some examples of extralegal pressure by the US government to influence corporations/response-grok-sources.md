### Examples of Extralegal Pressure by the US Government on Corporations

Extralegal pressure refers to informal or indirect methods used by government entities to influence corporate behavior without relying on formal legal mechanisms like legislation, court orders, or regulations. This can include threats, persuasion, or leveraging government relationships to encourage compliance. Below, I outline several documented examples, grouped thematically for clarity. These are drawn from historical and recent cases, primarily involving financial services, content moderation, and economic decisions. While some actions were later scrutinized or ruled upon by courts, they illustrate instances where pressure was applied outside traditional legal channels.

#### 1. Financial Sector Pressure (Operation Choke Point and Related Programs)
Operation Choke Point was a Department of Justice (DOJ) initiative launched in 2013 under the Obama administration, aimed at curbing fraud by pressuring banks to sever ties with certain "high-risk" businesses, such as payday lenders, firearms dealers, and others. Critics argued it involved extralegal tactics, like informal warnings or threats to banks' reputations and operations, without formal charges against the businesses.

- **Pressure on Banks to Cut Off Payday Lenders**: Federal regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), reportedly threatened banks with increased scrutiny or account closures if they continued servicing payday lenders. For instance, banks were told to "quit the business or we'll close your account," leading to widespread terminations of relationships with legal but disfavored industries [1][7][9].
  
- **Alleged "Operation Choke Point 2.0" in Cryptocurrency**: Similar tactics have been alleged in the crypto sector under the Biden administration. The FDIC reportedly sent letters to banks discouraging crypto-related activities, prompting claims from companies like Coinbase that this constituted informal pressure to "choke" crypto firms' access to banking services without explicit legal bans [2][6].

- **IRS Targeting of Conservative Groups**: In the IRS targeting controversy (2010â€“2013), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under the Obama administration applied heightened scrutiny and delays to tax-exempt applications from conservative political groups, such as Tea Party organizations. This was seen as extralegal pressure, as it involved selective enforcement without formal policy changes, later leading to apologies and settlements [8].

#### 2. Content Moderation and Censorship on Social Media Platforms
Government officials have been accused of pressuring tech companies to moderate content, often through informal communications rather than legal mandates, raising First Amendment concerns.

- **Pressure on Meta (Facebook) Regarding COVID-19 Content**: In 2021, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that the Biden administration repeatedly pressured the company to censor COVID-19-related posts, including humor and satire, which Meta resisted in some cases but complied with in others. This involved senior officials "expressing frustration" when demands weren't met [4]. A federal judge later issued an injunction limiting such White House communications with social media firms, citing potential coercion [5].

- **Twitter Files Revelations**: The "Twitter Files," released in 2022, documented how federal agencies like the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) informally requested Twitter (now X) to suppress certain content, including election-related misinformation and COVID-19 narratives. This pressure was exerted through regular meetings and emails, influencing moderation decisions without court orders [10].

- **WikiLeaks and Payment Processors**: In 2010, following WikiLeaks' release of classified documents, the US government reportedly pressured companies like Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal to block donations to WikiLeaks. This was done through informal channels, such as congressional letters and public statements, leading to voluntary cutoffs despite no formal charges against WikiLeaks at the time [3].

#### 3. Influence on Corporate Employment and Business Decisions
Presidents and administrations have used public pressure, threats of policy changes, or direct negotiations to influence corporate decisions on jobs and operations.

- **Lockheed Martin Layoff Notices**: In 2012, under the Obama administration, the White House requested that defense contractor Lockheed Martin delay issuing layoff notices ahead of the presidential election, citing potential job cuts from sequestration. Lockheed complied after the administration offered to cover legal costs, a move critics called extralegal interference to avoid negative publicity [11][14].

- **Carrier Corporation Job Retention**: In 2016, then-President-elect Donald Trump publicly pressured Carrier (a subsidiary of United Technologies) to keep manufacturing jobs in Indiana rather than moving them to Mexico. Through tweets, calls, and threats of tariffs or loss of government contracts, Trump influenced the company to retain about 800 jobs, though some relocation still occurred [12].

- **Amazon and Government Contracts**: In 2018, President Trump reportedly pressured the Pentagon to deny Amazon a $10 billion cloud computing contract (JEDI), citing personal animosity toward Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos (owner of The Washington Post). This involved public criticisms and informal directives, leading to lawsuits and the contract's eventual cancellation [13].

These examples highlight a pattern where government entities use leverage like regulatory threats, public shaming, or promises of benefits to influence corporations. While some actions were defended as legitimate oversight, others faced backlash, investigations, or judicial restrictions for overstepping legal bounds. For instance, Operation Choke Point was officially ended in 2017 amid congressional criticism [9], and court rulings have limited government-social media interactions [5]. Additional context from sources like congressional reports underscores concerns about secrecy and potential abuse of power [7].

If more examples are needed, further research could explore cases like the Trump administration's pressure on AT&T regarding its merger with Time Warner, as reported in outlets like The New York Times [15], which alleged interference due to CNN's coverage.
