Extralegal pressure by the US government on corporations refers to informal or indirect tactics—such as regulatory threats, behind-the-scenes communications, or leveraging agency influence—to coerce companies into altering their behavior, without relying on explicit legal mandates or court orders. This can include pressuring banks to sever ties with certain industries, urging social media platforms to censor content, or targeting organizations through selective scrutiny. Below, I outline several documented examples based on the provided sources, drawing from government actions across administrations. These cases often involve allegations of overreach, with some leading to lawsuits, congressional investigations, or judicial interventions. Where relevant, I've incorporated additional context from reliable sources for accuracy and completeness.

### 1. Operation Choke Point (2013–2017)
Operation Choke Point was a Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) initiative ostensibly aimed at combating fraud by pressuring banks to terminate relationships with "high-risk" but legal businesses, such as payday lenders, firearms dealers, and tobacco sellers. Critics argued this constituted extralegal pressure, as regulators used informal threats—like implying banks' accounts or licenses could be at risk—without formal accusations or due process [1][7][9]. For instance, banks reportedly told payday lenders to exit the industry or face account closures, even though the businesses were operating legally [1]. A 2023 congressional report confirmed that the DOJ secretly encouraged banks to cut ties, bypassing traditional enforcement mechanisms [7]. The program was discontinued in 2017 amid backlash, but it highlighted how regulatory "guidance" could function as coercion [9].

### 2. Alleged "Operation Choke Point 2.0" Targeting Cryptocurrency Firms (2022–Present)
Building on the original program, critics including Coinbase have alleged a "Choke Point 2.0" where federal regulators like the FDIC and Federal Reserve have pressured banks to limit services to cryptocurrency companies, such as denying accounts or imposing stricter oversight without clear legal justification [2][6]. This reportedly involved FDIC letters urging banks to pause crypto-related activities, amid broader regulatory scrutiny following crypto market collapses [6]. A New York Magazine investigation contextualized this as part of a pattern where regulators might use informal pressure to curb industries deemed risky, even if not illegal [2]. While the FDIC denies coordinated targeting, Coinbase and others claim it stifles innovation through extralegal means [6].

### 3. IRS Targeting of Political Groups (2010–2013)
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) controversy involved heightened scrutiny of conservative-leaning organizations applying for tax-exempt status, such as Tea Party groups, while similar liberal groups faced less review [8]. This was seen as extralegal pressure because the IRS used vague criteria like keywords (e.g., "patriot" or "tea party") to flag applications for extra audits and delays, without transparent legal grounds [8]. A 2013 Treasury Inspector General report confirmed inappropriate targeting, leading to lawsuits and congressional hearings [8]. Although the IRS apologized and no criminal charges resulted, it exemplified how administrative discretion could be wielded to influence politically active nonprofits [8].

### 4. Pressure on Social Media Companies to Censor Content (2020–2023)
The US government, particularly under the Biden administration, has been accused of exerting extralegal pressure on platforms like Meta (Facebook) and Twitter (now X) to suppress content related to COVID-19, elections, and other topics. Mark Zuckerberg publicly stated that senior officials repeatedly pressured Meta to censor posts, including humor and satire about COVID-19, with implied threats of regulatory consequences if they didn't comply [4]. The Twitter Files, a series of internal documents released in 2022, revealed frequent FBI and White House requests to remove or demote content, often without warrants, framing these as "suggestions" but effectively coercive [10]. A 2023 federal court ruling limited such communications, finding they violated free speech by coercing platforms into acting as government proxies [5]. This pattern echoes earlier instances, such as Obama-era pressure on tech firms [10].

### 5. Pressure on Financial Companies to Block WikiLeaks (2010)
In response to WikiLeaks' release of classified documents, the US government reportedly applied informal pressure on corporations like Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, and Amazon to sever ties with the organization, effectively cutting off its funding and hosting [3]. This was extralegal because no court order mandated the actions; instead, officials used diplomatic and regulatory influence to encourage voluntary compliance, limiting WikiLeaks' operations without formal sanctions [3]. A Reuters analysis noted this demonstrated the government's ability to influence private internet speech through indirect means, though it also highlighted limits when companies resisted [3]. The incident raised concerns about free speech and the power of extralegal "requests" to achieve censorship [3].

These examples illustrate a recurring theme: government agencies using their oversight roles to influence corporate decisions indirectly, often sparking debates over constitutionality and abuse of power. In some cases, like Operation Choke Point, programs were terminated due to public outcry [9]. Others, such as social media pressures, have led to ongoing litigation [5]. For further reading on similar tactics, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has documented government-corporate collusion in surveillance and censorship [11], emphasizing the need for transparency.
