Extralegal pressure by the US government refers to informal or indirect methods used by federal or state officials to influence corporate behavior without relying on explicit laws, court orders, or formal regulations. This can include threats of regulatory scrutiny, moral suasion (also known as "jawboning"), nudge tactics, or leveraging government relationships to encourage compliance. Such practices often raise concerns about overreach, free speech, and due process, as highlighted in various court cases and investigations. Below, I outline prominent examples drawn from historical and recent cases, categorized for clarity. These are based on the provided sources, supplemented where necessary for completeness and accuracy with additional reputable references (e.g., court documents or official reports).

### 1. Financial Sector: Operation Choke Point and Related Programs
Operation Choke Point was a Department of Justice (DOJ) initiative launched in 2013 under the Obama administration, aimed at combating fraud by pressuring banks to sever ties with businesses deemed "high-risk," such as payday lenders, firearms dealers, and tobacco sellers. Regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), used informal guidance and threats of heightened scrutiny to encourage banks to close accounts, even for legally operating companies. This was criticized as an extralegal means to "choke off" financial access without formal charges [7][9]. For instance, banks were reportedly told to "quit the business or we'll close your account" when dealing with payday lenders [1].

A similar pattern emerged in what critics call "Operation Choke Point 2.0," targeting cryptocurrency firms. In 2023, the FDIC allegedly sent letters to banks discouraging crypto-related activities, leading to account closures and restricted services. Coinbase and others claimed this was informal pressure to limit the industry's growth without new legislation [2][6]. The House Oversight Committee investigated these actions, finding evidence of secret DOJ pressure on banks to cut ties with legal businesses [7].

### 2. Social Media and Content Moderation
The US government has repeatedly used informal communications to pressure social media companies to censor or moderate content. In 2021, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that the Biden administration urged the company to suppress COVID-19-related posts, including humor and satire, which Meta resisted but felt compelled to address due to implied regulatory threats [4]. This was part of broader allegations in the Twitter Files, a series of internal documents released in 2022 showing FBI and other agencies pressuring Twitter (now X) to remove or shadow-ban content related to elections, Hunter Biden, and misinformation, often without legal warrants [10].

A federal judge in 2023 ruled that such communications from the White House and agencies like the FBI violated the First Amendment, restricting future interactions with platforms like Facebook and Twitter on content moderation [5]. These cases illustrate "jawboning," where officials use persuasion or veiled threats to influence private companies [15].

### 3. Political and Nonprofit Targeting
The IRS targeting controversy (2010â€“2013) involved the Internal Revenue Service applying extra scrutiny to conservative groups, such as Tea Party organizations, seeking tax-exempt status. Applications were delayed or denied based on political keywords, which a 2013 Treasury Inspector General report deemed inappropriate and extralegal, as it bypassed standard procedures [8]. This was seen as indirect pressure to hinder political activities without formal legal action.

In a state-level example, the Supreme Court case *National Rifle Association of America v. Vullo* (2024) addressed New York financial regulator Maria Vullo's 2018 guidance letters urging insurers and banks to sever ties with the NRA due to its gun advocacy. The Court ruled this constituted unconstitutional coercion, as it used regulatory authority to pressure companies informally [17].

### 4. Defense and Manufacturing Sector: Job Retention and Layoff Notices
During the 2012 presidential election, the Obama administration requested that defense contractor Lockheed Martin delay issuing layoff notices required under the WARN Act, amid sequestration budget cuts. The White House offered to cover potential legal costs, a move critics called extralegal interference to avoid negative preelection publicity [11][14]. Similarly, in 2011, the administration pressured Boeing to relocate a plant from South Carolina to union-friendly Washington state, though this involved NLRB actions that were later dropped [18, additional source for context on labor disputes].

Under the Trump administration, President Trump personally pressured Carrier (a United Technologies subsidiary) in 2016 to keep manufacturing jobs in Indiana instead of moving them to Mexico. Using public tweets, calls, and incentives like tax breaks, Trump influenced the company to retain some jobs, exemplifying moral suasion [12][15]. In 2018, Trump similarly jawboned General Motors over plant closures, threatening subsidy cuts and tariffs, leading to partial reversals [13].

### 5. Other Notable Cases: WikiLeaks and Broader Nudge Tactics
In 2010, following WikiLeaks' release of classified documents, the US government informally pressured financial companies like Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal to block donations to the organization. Without formal legal orders, these companies complied, effectively cutting off WikiLeaks' funding and highlighting the limits of internet free speech [3].

More broadly, nudge theory has been employed by administrations to influence corporate behavior subtly. For example, the Obama-era "nudge unit" encouraged energy companies to adopt green practices through informal incentives rather than mandates [16]. While often benign, critics argue it can blur into coercive pressure when tied to regulatory favors.

These examples demonstrate a pattern across administrations, often justified as protecting consumers or national security but criticized for circumventing legal processes. Legal challenges, such as those in *Missouri v. Biden* (related to social media pressure) [19, additional source for ongoing litigation], continue to test the boundaries of such tactics.
