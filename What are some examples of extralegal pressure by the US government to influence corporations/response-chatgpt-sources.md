**Examples of extralegal pressure by the U.S. government on corporations include:**

1. **Operation Choke Point (2013–2017):** The U.S. Department of Justice secretly launched *Operation Choke Point* to “choke off” certain legal businesses from banking services without new laws or formal regulations. Banks were leaned on to terminate relationships with lawful but “high-risk” industries (e.g. payday lenders, firearms dealers) by warning that serving them posed *reputational risk* that could trigger federal investigations [1]. In effect, regulators’ informal guidance became an **implicit threat** – banks were told (behind the scenes) that continuing to bank these companies might invite tougher scrutiny. As a result, many banks abruptly shut down accounts of businesses that had broken no law, effectively pressuring those companies to quit those lines of business or be **de-banked** [2]. This extralegal program drew heavy criticism and was ultimately shut down; the FDIC even settled lawsuits by agreeing to stop issuing “informal” unwritten suggestions to banks about which legal customers to avoid, an admission that the earlier pressure had overstepped proper authority [1].

2. **WikiLeaks Financial Blockade (2010):** After WikiLeaks published classified U.S. government cables, American officials (formally and informally) pressured private firms to cut off the site’s access to infrastructure and funds. For example, Senator Joe Lieberman publicly urged companies to stop servicing WikiLeaks – and indeed, Amazon abruptly **removed WikiLeaks from its web servers** following government criticism, and payment processors like Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal **suspended WikiLeaks’ accounts** even though no court had ordered them to do so [3]. This **financial blockade** severely disrupted WikiLeaks’ operations by choking off donations and web hosting. Observers noted that these corporations appeared to be acting “in response to a public request” from officials and out of fear of being seen as aiding an enemy of the state, rather than due to any legal requirement [3]. In other words, U.S. authorities used public pressure and behind-the-scenes warnings to induce companies to do what the government could not directly mandate – effectively censoring WikiLeaks by *extralegal means*.

3. **Pressure on Social Media to Censor Content (2020–2023):** There have been multiple instances of government officials pushing social media platforms to remove or suppress certain content outside any legal process. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic the Biden White House and other officials **repeatedly urged** Facebook/Meta to *remove posts* they deemed “misinformation” about COVID – even including humorous or satirical content – despite such speech being legally protected [4]. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg later revealed that his company felt “pressured” by senior administration officials to censor certain COVID-19 discussions, and he expressed regret for complying with some of those takedown requests, calling the government pressure “wrong” [4]. In a related vein, internal files from Twitter (the “Twitter Files” released in 2022) showed that agencies like the FBI regularly **flagged tweets and accounts** to Twitter for moderation, and one Twitter executive described the close cooperation as *“government–industry sync”* due to the constant contact [8]. This unofficial coordination led to Twitter sometimes suppressing content (e.g. posts about elections or the Hunter Biden laptop story) at the behest of government actors, raising concerns that authorities were skirting First Amendment limits by using private platforms as proxies. In mid-2023, a federal judge responded to evidence of such contacts by **barring** certain Biden administration agencies and officials from communicating with social-media companies about moderating protected speech. The judge found that the government had likely “gone too far” in pressing platforms to delete or downgrade content, and the injunction aimed to stop officials from encouraging censorship of *“dissenting views”* under the guise of combating misinformation [5].

4. **“Operation Choke Point 2.0” (Crypto Industry, 2022–2023):** More recently, figures in the cryptocurrency industry have accused U.S. regulators of running an *unofficial crackdown* to isolate crypto businesses from the banking system – a campaign they’ve dubbed **Operation Choke Point 2.0**. While not formally acknowledged by government, evidence has emerged that regulators quietly **pressured banks to distance themselves from crypto clients**. In 2022, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) privately asked nearly two dozen banks to **“pause” or limit their crypto-related activities**, according to letters later obtained via FOIA requests [6]. This informal guidance (issued after high-profile crypto collapses) effectively discouraged banks from doing business with legitimate crypto exchanges and firms, without any law or new rule stating they must do so. Crypto advocates argue that the coordinated timing – including the sudden closures or debanking of major crypto-friendly banks – indicates a *de facto* policy to strangle the crypto sector’s access to finance, much like the original Operation Choke Point targeted other industries [6]. Regulators deny any unlawful targeting, but the practice of quietly warning banks off entire lawful sectors (rather than case-by-case enforcement) is seen as extralegal pressure, since it leverages supervisory power to achieve policy aims not enacted by Congress.

5. **IRS Targeting Controversy (2010–2013):** Another example often cited as extralegal pressure was the IRS’s treatment of certain non-profit organizations based on their political leanings. An internal audit in 2013 revealed that IRS officials had singled out applications from conservative-leaning groups (especially those with names like “Tea Party” or “Patriots”) for **extra scrutiny and delays** when they applied for tax-exempt status [7]. This **selective targeting** was not mandated by any law or policy – in fact, it violated standard, neutral procedure – and appeared to be driven by political bias inside the agency. Dozens of conservative groups experienced long delays or intrusive questions, effectively impeding their activities during the 2012 election cycle. When this practice came to light, it caused a scandal: the IRS apologized, and investigations confirmed that inappropriate criteria had been used to flag groups (primarily on the right, though some left-leaning names were flagged too) [7]. Critics characterized this as extralegal harassment by government officials – using the IRS’s vast discretionary power to **burden or intimidate certain organizations** without any legal justification, thereby influencing which voices in civil society could operate freely.

In a letter to lawmakers, Zuckerberg described repeated urging by senior officials to remove certain posts (even satire), and he acknowledged now that this pressure led to content removals he **“wouldn’t make” today.** Zuckerberg’s view is that the government’s behind-the-scenes demands were improper, effectively pushing Meta to go beyond its own policies – a clear example of extralegal pressure on a private platform to control speech.

The ruling came after evidence that officials **“went too far” in encouraging social-media censorship** of posts related to COVID vaccines and elections. Republican-led states alleged the White House and agencies essentially **coerced platforms** to suppress certain viewpoints (beyond any legal remit). The judge’s order to restrict contact was meant to prevent government actors from pressuring companies to **remove or suppress protected speech**, underscoring that such informal influence likely violated First Amendment principles.

6. **Banking Dive (Dec. 2024)** – Gabrielle Saulsbery reports on documents indicating a **new “Operation Choke Point 2.0”** targeting crypto. Letters obtained through FOIA show the FDIC privately asked nearly two dozen banks to **“pause” or limit** their dealings with cryptocurrency firms in 2022. This unofficial guidance happened amid high-profile crypto failures, but came **without any new law or formal rule**, bolstering claims that regulators coordinated to **de-bank the crypto sector** by stealth. The article presents the perspective of Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer and others: they argue this is a concerted, extralegal effort by regulators under the Biden administration to throttle crypto companies’ access to banking (analogous to the original Operation Choke Point’s methods).

Describes how IRS workers used political keywords (like “Tea Party”) to flag certain non-profit applicants, leading to accusations that the government **unfairly targeted and delayed** right-leaning organizations. Provides context that while some liberal groups were also flagged, investigations found conservative applicants faced significantly more scrutiny, which was widely condemned as improper and politically biased use of government power.

Reveals that the FBI and other officials regularly **flagged tweets/accounts** for removal or review, and that Twitter staff at times felt they were in a “**government–industry**” partnership. Highlights criticisms that this amounted to **indirect government censorship** – e.g. the FBI forwarding lists of supposedly harmful accounts (including parody or dissenting voices) for Twitter to act on. While the government defended its outreach as fighting disinformation, the *Twitter Files* were cited by free-speech advocates as an example of extralegal pressure on a corporation to censor content beyond what the law could compel.
