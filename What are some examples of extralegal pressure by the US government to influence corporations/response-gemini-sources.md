Based on the provided sources, the U.S. government has used various forms of extralegal pressure to influence corporate behavior. These actions, which fall outside of formal laws or regulations, often involve using the government's authority and public platform to persuade or coerce companies on matters ranging from financial services and content moderation to employment and manufacturing decisions.

Examples of this pressure include:

### 1. Pressure on Financial Institutions and Services

*   **Operation Choke Point**: This was a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) initiative started in 2013. Officially, its goal was to combat mass-market consumer fraud by investigating banks that did business with companies engaged in fraudulent activities [9]. However, a 2014 report from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform concluded that the DOJ and regulators secretly pressured banks to terminate relationships with legal, but politically disfavored, businesses, including firearm dealers, payday lenders, and other financial services companies [1, 7]. Regulators would flag these industries as "high-risk," leading banks to close their accounts to avoid heightened government scrutiny [1, 9].
*   **"Operation Choke Point 2.0"**: Crypto-industry advocates and some banking executives have used this term to describe what they perceive as a coordinated, but informal, effort by financial regulators under the Biden administration to discourage banks from offering services to cryptocurrency firms [2, 6]. This alleged pressure involves regulators issuing public warnings about the risks of crypto and subjecting banks with crypto clients to intense supervisory scrutiny, leading some banks to "de-bank" or avoid crypto customers altogether [2, 6].
*   **Cutting Services to WikiLeaks**: In 2010, after WikiLeaks published a trove of sensitive diplomatic cables, U.S. officials, including Senator Joe Lieberman, publicly called for companies to stop providing services to the organization. Following this pressure, companies including Amazon, PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard suspended services for WikiLeaks, significantly hindering its ability to operate and collect donations [3].

### 2. Pressure on Tech Companies and Content Moderation

*   **COVID-19 Content Censorship**: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Biden administration pressured the company to remove content, including posts that were true but inconvenient for the administration's public health messaging. He stated the White House threatened regulatory action if Meta did not increase its content censorship efforts [4]. This pressure campaign was extensive enough that in 2023, a federal judge issued an injunction restricting White House and other government officials from communicating with social media companies for the purpose of "encouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech" [5].
*   **The "Twitter Files"**: Internal documents from Twitter released in 2022 revealed frequent and regular communications between the company and multiple U.S. government agencies, including the FBI [10]. These communications included requests from the government to review or take action on specific accounts and posts related to topics like election integrity and foreign influence operations [10].

### 3. Pressure on Business Operations and Employment

*   **Delaying Layoff Notices**: In 2012, the Obama administration successfully requested that major defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin, delay sending legally required layoff notices to workers ahead of the presidential election [11, 14]. The potential layoffs were due to looming automatic budget cuts (sequestration), and the administration gave the companies assurances that they would be covered for any associated legal costs [11].
*   **Manufacturing Plant Locations**: As President-elect, Donald Trump publicly pressured and negotiated with the air conditioning manufacturer Carrier to prevent it from moving a plant from Indiana to Mexico. The effort involved a mix of public pressure via his "bully pulpit" and a deal for $7 million in state tax incentives. The parent company of Carrier, United Technologies, was also a major federal defense contractor, a fact Trump referenced in his campaign to keep the jobs in the U.S. [12]. Similarly, President Trump publicly threatened to cut federal subsidies to General Motors after it announced plant closures and layoffs in 2018 [13].

### 4. Pressure through Regulatory Scrutiny

*   **IRS Targeting Controversy**: A 2013 Treasury Inspector General report found that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had used inappropriate criteria to identify for extra scrutiny the tax-exempt status applications of organizations with names including "Tea Party" or "Patriots" [8]. While targeting non-profit political groups rather than for-profit corporations, it serves as an example of a federal agency using its regulatory power to exert pressure on specific types of organizations based on their political leanings [8].
