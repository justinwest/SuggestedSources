The U.S. government has used extralegal pressure, often called "jawboning" or "moral suasion," to influence corporate behavior across various administrations [15]. This involves using the government's influence, public appeals, or the threat of adverse regulatory action to persuade companies to act in a certain way, without passing a specific law or obtaining a court order [15]. Examples of this pressure span financial services, social media content moderation, and corporate employment decisions.

### Pressure on Financial Institutions and Payment Processors
The government has pressured financial institutions to deny services to legal but disfavored industries.
*   **Operation Choke Point** This was a Department of Justice (DOJ) initiative under the Obama administration that began in 2013 [9]. The program officially aimed to combat mass-market consumer fraud by investigating banks that did business with companies considered at high risk for such activities [1, 9]. However, a 2014 House Oversight Committee report concluded the initiative secretly pressured banks to terminate relationships with legal businesses, including firearm dealers, payday lenders, and ammunition sellers, by creating the impression that these businesses were inherently risky and could attract regulatory scrutiny [7]. Banks began closing the accounts of these businesses, stating it was no longer worth the risk of doing business with them [1].
*   **Alleged Pressure on the Cryptocurrency Industry** Critics and crypto-industry leaders have claimed that a similar, informal campaign, dubbed "Operation Choke Point 2.0," is being waged by regulators under the Biden administration [2, 6]. They allege that federal agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), have used vague warnings and heightened regulatory scrutiny to implicitly discourage banks from providing services to cryptocurrency companies [2, 6].
*   **Cutting Off Services to WikiLeaks** In 2010, after WikiLeaks published a trove of sensitive U.S. diplomatic cables, several major companies, including Amazon, PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard, cut off services to the organization [3]. This occurred after significant public pressure from U.S. officials, including Senator Joe Lieberman, who was then chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee and publicly called for companies to stop assisting WikiLeaks [3].

### Pressure on Social Media and Tech Companies
Recent years have seen extensive government efforts to influence content moderation policies at major technology firms.
*   **COVID-19 and Election Content** The Biden White House and other federal agencies repeatedly pressured social media companies like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter (now X) to remove posts and deplatform users who shared content the government considered misinformation, particularly regarding COVID-19 and the 2022 elections [4, 5]. In a 2023 ruling for the *Missouri v. Biden* case, a federal judge stated that the government's campaign likely violated the First Amendment by coercing platforms into censoring protected speech [5]. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg later testified that the administration's pressure was intense and included threats of "some kind of regulatory repercussion" if the company did not increase its content moderation efforts [4].
*   **The Twitter Files** Internal documents from Twitter, released in 2022, revealed frequent and persistent communications between the company and government agencies like the FBI [10]. These communications included regular meetings where agencies flagged specific accounts and posts for review, requested user data, and pressured Twitter to take action against alleged foreign influence and domestic misinformation, blurring the line between government recommendation and demand [10].

### Presidential "Jawboning" on Business and Employment
Presidents from both parties have used the power of their office to publicly and privately pressure corporations on decisions related to employment and operations.
*   **Defense Contractor Layoffs** In 2012, the Obama administration successfully persuaded defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin, to delay sending legally required layoff notices to workers ahead of the presidential election [11, 14]. The potential layoffs were due to looming automatic budget cuts (sequestration), but the White House, concerned about the political impact, asked the companies to hold off and offered to cover any legal costs they might incur for failing to comply with the 60-day notice law [14].
*   **Carrier Manufacturing Plant** In 2016, President-elect Donald Trump publicly pressured and negotiated with Carrier's parent company, United Technologies, to prevent the company from moving a furnace plant from Indiana to Mexico [12]. The final deal involved a mix of public pressure and $7 million in state tax incentives, but the move was widely seen as an example of using the presidential pulpit to alter a specific company's business plans [12].
*   **General Motors Plant Closures** Following General Motors' 2018 announcement that it would close several plants and lay off thousands of workers, President Trump threatened to retaliate by cutting federal subsidies to the company, including those for electric vehicles [13].

### Use of Regulatory Agencies
Government agencies have also been accused of using their regulatory power to exert pressure on organizations based on their political views.
*   **IRS Targeting Controversy** Starting in 2010, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was found to have subjected conservative and "Tea Party" groups applying for tax-exempt status to extra scrutiny [8]. These organizations experienced significant delays and were asked for information that was not typically required of other groups, leading to accusations that the IRS was using its authority to improperly target groups based on their political orientation [8].
