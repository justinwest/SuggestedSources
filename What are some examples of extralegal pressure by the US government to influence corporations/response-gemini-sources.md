The U.S. government has used extralegal pressure—influence and coercion falling outside of formal legal proceedings or statutes—to influence corporate behavior in several documented instances. These efforts have targeted industries ranging from banking and finance to social media and payment processing.

Key examples include:

**1. Financial De-platforming and Operation Choke Point**
Operation Choke Point was a Department of Justice (DOJ) initiative launched in 2013. Officially, its goal was to combat mass-market consumer fraud by targeting banks that processed transactions for fraudulent businesses [9]. However, critics and a 2014 House Oversight Committee report argued that the operation went far beyond its stated purpose. The report concluded that the DOJ and federal regulators like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) secretly pressured banks to terminate their relationships with legal but politically disfavored businesses, including payday lenders, firearms dealers, and ammunition sellers [1, 7, 9]. Banks were reportedly warned that their relationships with these "high-risk" clients could attract greater regulatory scrutiny, effectively coercing them to close accounts even when there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the client [1, 7].

In recent years, critics have alleged a revival of these tactics, sometimes dubbed "Operation Choke Point 2.0," targeting the cryptocurrency industry [2, 6]. Following the collapse of several crypto firms, regulators issued warnings and public statements about the risks associated with crypto-assets. This led to banks becoming increasingly hesitant to provide services to digital asset companies, with some crypto executives reporting that banks had abruptly closed their accounts without clear reasons [2]. While regulators maintain they are providing necessary guidance on risk management, critics argue that this creates a chilling effect, pressuring banks to de-risk and de-bank the entire crypto sector without formal legislation [6].

**2. Pressure on Social Media Companies for Content Moderation**
Multiple government bodies and officials have been accused of pressuring social media companies to censor specific viewpoints and content.

*   **COVID-19 Content:** In a lawsuit filed by the attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana, a federal judge found that the Biden administration had likely coerced social media platforms into suppressing protected free speech. The judge's 2023 ruling stated that government agencies, including the White House, FBI, and CDC, engaged in a "broad pressure campaign" to get companies to remove posts related to topics like COVID-19 vaccines and the lab-leak theory [5]. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg later testified that the Biden administration had pressured the company to censor even humorous or satirical content related to COVID-19, and that the government was "upset" that Meta did not remove certain content more aggressively [4].

*   **The Twitter Files:** Internal documents released from Twitter, known as the "Twitter Files," revealed frequent and extensive communication between the company and federal government agencies, including the FBI. These communications included requests from the government to review and take action on specific accounts and content related to elections and other matters [10]. The files illustrated a close working relationship where government agencies flagged content for moderation, blurring the line between cooperation and pressure [5, 10].

**3. Pressure on Payment Processors and Tech Companies**
In 2010, following the release of sensitive U.S. diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks, several major corporations cut off services to the organization. Amazon removed WikiLeaks from its web-hosting servers, and payment processors including PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard stopped processing donations to the group [3]. These actions were not mandated by a court order but followed what was described as "intense U.S. political pressure," including public calls for boycotts from prominent politicians. This demonstrated how government officials could use public condemnation to influence corporate decisions and financially isolate an organization [3].

**4. IRS Targeting of Political Organizations**
The IRS targeting controversy, which came to light in 2013, involved the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) singling out conservative and Tea Party organizations for heightened scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status [8]. These groups faced extensive delays and were asked for information that was often considered unnecessary and intrusive, such as donor lists and copies of social media posts. While not targeting traditional for-profit corporations, this serves as an example of a federal agency using its regulatory power to apply extralegal pressure on organizations based on their political viewpoints [8].
