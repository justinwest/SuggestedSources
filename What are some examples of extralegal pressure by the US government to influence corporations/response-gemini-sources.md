The U.S. government has used extralegal pressure, also known as "jawboning" or "moral suasion," to influence corporate behavior across various sectors [15]. This type of influence does not rely on specific laws or regulations but on the government's authority, public platform, and implicit power to persuade, coax, or threaten companies into compliance. Examples range from pressuring financial institutions and technology companies to influencing manufacturing and employment decisions.

### Pressure on Financial Institutions and Services

One of the most prominent examples of this pressure is **Operation Choke Point**, an initiative by the Department of Justice (DOJ) during the Obama administration.
*   **Targeting "High-Risk" Industries**: The program aimed to cut off financial services to businesses that the government deemed undesirable or at high risk for fraud, even if they were operating legally. These included payday lenders, firearm dealers, and other businesses [7, 9].
*   **Method of Pressure**: Federal regulators, including the FDIC, pressured banks to close the accounts of these businesses by threatening heightened regulatory scrutiny and audits. Fearing repercussions, many banks complied and terminated long-standing client relationships [1, 7]. A U.S. House Oversight Committee report concluded that the DOJ and regulators engaged in a "secret" campaign to force these legal businesses out of the financial system [7].

A similar pattern of pressure has been alleged by the cryptocurrency industry in what some have termed **"Operation Choke Point 2.0."**
*   **"De-banking" Crypto Firms**: Following the collapse of several crypto firms in 2022, federal regulators issued public warnings about the liquidity risks associated with the crypto industry. Subsequently, many banks began cutting ties with or refusing to serve digital-asset companies [2, 6].
*   **Unofficial Coordination**: Critics argue that while there is no official directive, the coordinated statements and heightened scrutiny from the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have created a climate where banks feel it is too risky to serve the crypto sector, effectively "de-banking" it without any new legislation [2, 6].

Another case involved state-level pressure on financial firms in relation to a political advocacy group.
*   ***NRA v. Vullo***: After the 2018 Parkland, Florida school shooting, a New York financial regulator, Maria Vullo, allegedly used her position to pressure banks and insurance companies to sever ties with the National Rifle Association (NRA). The Supreme Court ruled in 2024 that the NRA could proceed with its lawsuit, which claims that Vullo’s actions amounted to coercive government threats that violated the NRA's First Amendment rights [17].

### Pressure on Technology and Social Media Companies

Federal agencies have also exerted significant pressure on technology companies, particularly regarding content moderation.
*   **Content Moderation and Censorship**: The "Twitter Files" revealed extensive communications between government agencies like the FBI and Twitter, where officials flagged specific accounts and posts for review, particularly concerning the 2020 election [10]. Similarly, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified that the Biden administration pressured the company to censor certain COVID-19 content, including material that was "dubious but not false" and posts from prominent figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [4].
*   **Judicial Intervention**: These actions led to the lawsuit *Missouri v. Biden*, in which a federal judge restricted White House and federal agency officials from communicating with social media companies about moderating protected speech. The judge stated that the government had likely "engaged in a massive, sprawling censorship enterprise" [5].
*   **Pressure on Service Providers**: An earlier example occurred in 2010 when, following WikiLeaks' publication of sensitive U.S. diplomatic cables, government officials publicly called for companies to stop providing services to the organization. In response, Amazon removed WikiLeaks from its web-hosting servers, and companies like PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard stopped processing donations to the group, effectively cutting off its funding streams [3].

### Pressure on Employment and Manufacturing Decisions

Presidents have also used their public platform to directly influence the operational decisions of major corporations.
*   **Carrier (Trump Administration)**: In 2016, President-elect Donald Trump publicly criticized the manufacturing company Carrier for its plans to move over 1,000 jobs from Indiana to Mexico. Through a combination of public pressure and the negotiation of $7 million in state tax incentives, Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence persuaded Carrier to keep approximately 800 of those jobs in the U.S. [12, 13].
*   **Lockheed Martin (Obama Administration)**: In 2012, facing automatic defense spending cuts, defense contractors like Lockheed Martin planned to issue layoff notices to thousands of employees 60 days before the presidential election, as required by law. The Obama White House requested that the companies delay sending the notices, and Lockheed Martin complied. This was seen as an effort to avoid negative economic news immediately preceding the election [11, 14].
