Extralegal pressure by the U.S. government refers to actions where officials use their influence, authority, or the perceived power of their office to influence corporate behavior without passing a specific law or initiating a formal legal process. This can range from public persuasion, known as "jawboning" [15], to more coercive, behind-the-scenes efforts to "nudge" or compel companies to act in a certain way [16]. Examples span various administrations and target diverse industries, from banking and finance to social media and manufacturing.

Here are some prominent examples of extralegal pressure by the U.S. government on corporations:

### 1. Pressure on Banks and Financial Institutions

The government has used its regulatory influence over the financial sector to discourage banks from serving industries that are legal but politically disfavored.

*   **Operation Choke Point:** This was a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) initiative under the Obama administration, publicly announced in 2013. The program officially targeted illegal or fraudulent businesses but was accused of pressuring banks to terminate relationships with a wide range of legal businesses, including payday lenders, firearm dealers, and ammunition sellers [1, 9]. A 2014 House Oversight Committee report concluded that the DOJ and regulators were "exerting informal, behind-the-scenes pressure" to "choke off" these businesses' access to banking services, effectively forcing them out of business without having to prove they had broken any laws [7].
*   **"Operation Choke Point 2.0":** In the 2020s, critics have used this term to describe what they see as a coordinated effort by financial regulators under the Biden administration to discourage banks from providing services to cryptocurrency companies [2, 6]. While regulators state they are providing guidance on managing the high risks associated with the crypto sector, industry participants claim this amounts to a "shadow ban" or "de-banking" campaign, where banks feel pressured to drop crypto clients to avoid heightened regulatory scrutiny [2, 6].
*   **Pressure Following WikiLeaks Disclosures:** In 2010, after WikiLeaks published a trove of sensitive U.S. diplomatic cables, government officials publicly pressured financial service companies to cut ties with the organization. Following comments from officials, including Senator Joe Lieberman, companies like Amazon, PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard suspended services for WikiLeaks, significantly hampering its ability to receive donations [3].
*   **Pressure on Institutions Serving the NRA:** In *National Rifle Association of America v. Vullo* (2024), the Supreme Court reviewed allegations that a New York state official, Maria Vullo, used her regulatory power to coerce banks and insurance companies into severing ties with the NRA after the Parkland school shooting. The NRA argued this was unconstitutional pressure designed to suppress its First Amendment rights. The Court ruled that a government official cannot use their power to coerce private parties to suppress disfavored speech, strengthening protections against this form of extralegal pressure [17].

### 2. Pressure on Social Media Companies for Content Moderation

Both Republican and Democratic administrations have been accused of pressuring social media companies to align their content moderation policies with government preferences.

*   **COVID-19 and Election Content:** A federal judge in 2023 issued an injunction restricting Biden administration officials from communicating with social media companies about moderating protected free speech [5]. The ruling cited extensive evidence of officials "significantly encouraging, and at times coercing" platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter (now X) to remove or suppress content, particularly related to COVID-19 policies and the 2020 election [5]. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg later testified that the Biden administration had been "very direct" in its pressure on Facebook to censor certain COVID-19 content [4].
*   **The "Twitter Files":** Internal documents from Twitter released in 2022 revealed frequent and routine communication between company executives and government agencies, including the FBI, DHS, and the White House [10]. These communications included requests to review and sometimes remove specific content and accounts, raising concerns about government influence over content moderation decisions on the platform [10].

### 3. Presidential "Jawboning" on Business Operations

Presidents have often used their public platform and the threat of government action to influence corporate decisions regarding jobs, investments, and pricing.

*   **Carrier Plant in Indiana:** In 2016, President-elect Donald Trump publicly pressured the air-conditioner manufacturer Carrier and its parent company, United Technologies, to reverse a decision to move a plant from Indiana to Mexico. Citing the leverage of United Technologies' significant federal defense contracts, Trump successfully negotiated a deal to keep a portion of the jobs in the state [12].
*   **General Motors Plant Closures:** President Trump also publicly attacked General Motors in 2018 for its decision to close plants in the U.S., threatening to cut federal subsidies to the company [13].
*   **Defense Contractor Layoff Notices:** In 2012, the Obama administration asked defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin, to delay issuing legally required mass layoff notices ahead of the presidential election [11]. The potential layoffs were triggered by impending automatic budget cuts (sequestration). The White House argued the notices were premature and offered to cover the companies' legal liability if they were sued for failing to provide the required 60-day notice [11, 14].

### 4. Targeted Scrutiny by Government Agencies

Government agencies have been accused of using their regulatory and enforcement powers to apply disproportionate pressure on certain groups or organizations.

*   **IRS Targeting Controversy:** Beginning in 2013, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was found to have subjected conservative and Tea Party-affiliated political groups to heightened scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status [8]. These groups faced extensive delays and unusually detailed, burdensome requests for information, which critics argued was an abuse of the IRS's power to create a chilling effect on political activity [8].
