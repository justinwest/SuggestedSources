Extralegal pressure refers to government officials using informal or coercive tactics – outside the normal legal or legislative process – to sway corporate behavior. Over the years, U.S. administrations have at times influenced companies through such means. Here are a few notable examples:

**1. Operation Choke Point (2013-2017):** This was an Obama-era Department of Justice (DOJ) initiative that leveraged bank regulators to cut off banking services for certain industries the administration deemed undesirable (even though those businesses were lawful) ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20Operation%20Choke%20Point%20was,every%20business%20needs%20to%20survive)). Under Operation Choke Point, regulators labeled various legal sectors – from payday lenders and gun retailers to coin dealers – as “high-risk” and warned banks of **“reputational risk”**, implicitly threatening federal investigations if they didn’t drop those clients ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=merchants%20creates%20a%20%E2%80%9Creputational%20risk%E2%80%9D,threat%20of%20a%20federal%20investigation)) ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20The%20Department%20lacks%20adequate,expanded%20its%20Section%20951%20authority)). Internal memos showed officials knew the policy was forcing banks to exit entire lines of legal business ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20The%20Department%20is%20aware,%E2%80%9Chigh%20risk%E2%80%9D%20by%20the%20government)). Critics argue this was **extralegal coercion**: rather than outlawing these industries through legislation, agencies informally **intimidated banks** into denying services, effectively choking off the targeted businesses’ access to finance ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20Operation%20Choke%20Point%20was,every%20business%20needs%20to%20survive)) ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnberlau/2018/10/31/choke-point-is-frightening-precedent-for-bank-regulatory-abuse/#:~:text=Yet%20after%20reading%20through%20new,access%20to%20the%20banking%20system)). A House Oversight report concluded DOJ **“lacked adequate legal authority”** for this program and had stretched its statutory powers beyond their limits ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20The%20Department%20lacks%20adequate,expanded%20its%20Section%20951%20authority)). Operation Choke Point was eventually wound down amid backlash, with observers calling it a “frightening” precedent for regulatory abuse via informal pressure ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnberlau/2018/10/31/choke-point-is-frightening-precedent-for-bank-regulatory-abuse/#:~:text=Yet%20after%20reading%20through%20new,access%20to%20the%20banking%20system)).

**2. Government “Jawboning” of Tech Platforms:** U.S. officials have often applied extralegal pressure on social media and tech companies to moderate content. **“Jawboning”** is the term for when authorities use their influence – not laws – to push private platforms to take down or restrict certain speech ([www.lawfaremedia.org](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/informal-government-coercion-and-problem-jawboning#:~:text=For%20years%20now%2C%20scholars%20have,the%20social%20media%20companies%20do)). For example, members of Congress and executive agencies have **urged or warned social media companies** to remove content deemed misinformation, hate speech, or otherwise harmful, under implied threats of regulation or legal action ([www.lawfaremedia.org](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/informal-government-coercion-and-problem-jawboning#:~:text=For%20years%20now%2C%20scholars%20have,the%20social%20media%20companies%20do)) ([www.eff.org](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/06/when-jawboning-creates-private-liability?language=ar#:~:text=Among%20the%20state%20actor%20theories,they%20act%20according%20to%20it)). In 2021, the Biden administration’s Surgeon General and White House officials publicly **pressured Facebook** to speed up removal of COVID-19 vaccine falsehoods, even flagging specific “problematic” posts and accounts for the platform to act on ([www.lawfaremedia.org](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/informal-government-coercion-and-problem-jawboning#:~:text=The%20second%20jawboning,the%20First%20Amendment%20rights%20of)). This raised debates about whether such informal directives crossed into coercion that violates the First Amendment (since the government can’t directly censor speech) ([www.lawfaremedia.org](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/informal-government-coercion-and-problem-jawboning#:~:text=The%20second%20jawboning,the%20First%20Amendment%20rights%20of)). A notable case, *Missouri v. Biden*, alleged that federal officials **“coerced” social platforms** to censor disfavored viewpoints on pandemic and election topics ([www.lawfaremedia.org](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/it-depends-who-s-doing-the-jawboning#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20on%20March,federal%20government%20asserts%20that%20the)). A lower court initially found that officials likely went beyond mere persuasion and **“significantly encouraged”** private censorship, issuing an injunction to halt certain contacts ([www.lawfaremedia.org](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/it-depends-who-s-doing-the-jawboning#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20on%20March,federal%20government%20asserts%20that%20the)). (That order was later put on hold, and the Supreme Court ultimately set aside the case on procedural grounds, but the controversy underscored the blurry line between advice and pressure ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-wont-curb-biden-administration-social-media-contacts-2024-06-26/#:~:text=The%20U,allows%20the%20administration%20to%20continue)).) Similarly, during previous administrations, lawmakers threatened to weaken tech companies’ legal protections (like Section 230 immunity) or pursue antitrust actions if platforms didn’t address content issues to their satisfaction. This kind of *arms-length influence* – using political clout and public shaming rather than statutes – exemplifies extralegal pressure on corporations to change policies. Digital rights advocates warn that such **informal government intervention** in content moderation, even if well-intentioned, can become “**a system of informal censorship**” incompatible with free-speech norms ([www.eff.org](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/06/when-jawboning-creates-private-liability?language=ar#:~:text=suits%20against%20government%20agencies%20and,processing%20payments%20to%20the%20website)).

**3. Presidential Bullying and Retaliation:** U.S. presidents have at times directly pressured companies through extralegal means, often via the “bully pulpit” or behind-the-scenes leverage. A classic example is **President John F. Kennedy’s clash with U.S. Steel in 1962**. After the steel industry announced a sudden price hike that JFK felt would damage the economy, he reacted with public fury and private threats. Kennedy lambasted the move as a “wholly unjustifiable…defiance of the public interest,” and his administration hinted at reprisals, including antitrust scrutiny and shifting government steel orders to competitors ([www.peoplesworld.org](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/how-jfk-forced-steel-price-roll-back/#:~:text=was%20biting%20%E2%80%93%20but%20he,even%20more%20caustic%20in%20private)) ([time.com](https://time.com/archive/6627918/steel-the-price-fixing-verdict/#:~:text=Since%20John%20F,a%20big%2C%20if%20qualified%2C%20victory)). Under this intense pressure, the major steel companies backed down and rolled back the price increase – a victory achieved not by any new law, but by presidential **jawboning and the implicit threat of government action** ([time.com](https://time.com/archive/6627918/steel-the-price-fixing-verdict/#:~:text=Since%20John%20F,a%20big%2C%20if%20qualified%2C%20victory)). Another example is **President Richard Nixon’s attempts to retaliate against media corporations** critical of him. Angered by *The Washington Post*’s Watergate reporting, Nixon’s allies secretly tried to **challenge the broadcast licenses** of television stations owned by the Post’s parent company in 1973 ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/#:~:text=But%20here%27s%20the%20thing%3A%20That,were%20The%20Washington%20Post%20Co)). While the White House denied orchestrating it, the timing and connections made it clear this was a form of presidential harassment – using regulatory processes and proxies to punish a company for its journalism ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/#:~:text=In%201973%2C%20the%20Associated%20Press,Watergate%20investigation%20of%20the%20president)) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/#:~:text=Nixon%27s%20press%20secretary%2C%20Ronald%20Ziegler%2C,%E2%80%9CNo%2C%20absolutely%20not%2C%E2%80%9D%20Ziegler%20assured)). Fast forward to recent years, **President Donald Trump** also repeatedly pressured or threatened companies without formal legal basis. He **mused about revoking NBC’s broadcast licenses** after negative coverage, and he attacked Amazon (owned by Post owner Jeff Bezos) with calls for higher postal rates and antitrust scrutiny, largely to pressure Bezos over *Washington Post* coverage ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2017/12/15/why-trump-cant-revoke-nbcs-broadcast-licenses-1513306121#:~:text=President%20Trump%20questioned%20the%20appropriateness,than%20implied%20by%20Trump%27s%20statements)). Trump’s 2017 tweets about limiting network licenses were widely condemned as “Nixonian,” since they so closely paralleled Nixon’s tactics of using extralegal levers against unfriendly media ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/#:~:text=President%20Trump%20is%20yet%20again,to%20attempt%20in%20the%201970s)). In all these cases – Kennedy with steel producers, Nixon/Trump with press outlets, and others – the presidents sought to **influence corporate decisions through intimidation, public shaming, or implied regulatory retaliation rather than through duly enacted law** ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/#:~:text=President%20Trump%20is%20yet%20again,to%20attempt%20in%20the%201970s)) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/#:~:text=But%20here%27s%20the%20thing%3A%20That,were%20The%20Washington%20Post%20Co)).

Each of the above illustrates extralegal pressure: government actors stepping outside normal legislative or judicial channels to strong-arm corporations. Such pressure can be effective, but it is controversial because it evades accountability and tests the limits of the rule of law. Critics from across the political spectrum argue that when officials **“harass” or threaten private businesses into compliance without legal authority, it undermines transparency and the constitutional checks on government power ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20The%20Department%20lacks%20adequate,expanded%20its%20Section%20951%20authority)) ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnberlau/2018/10/31/choke-point-is-frightening-precedent-for-bank-regulatory-abuse/#:~:text=Yet%20after%20reading%20through%20new,access%20to%20the%20banking%20system)). On the other hand, some officials defend informal pressure as a quick way to serve the public interest (for instance, urging voluntary action on urgent problems when legislation is slow or absent) ([www.americanbar.org](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/administrative_law/resources/administrative-law-review/2023-spring/operation-choke-point-myths-reality/#:~:text=This%20Article%20is%20an%20attempt,Backlash%20erupted)) ([www.americanbar.org](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/administrative_law/resources/administrative-law-review/2023-spring/operation-choke-point-myths-reality/#:~:text=a%20benign%20initiative%20involving%20a,The%20gun%20industry)). The tension between those views continues in current debates – for example, how far the government can go in leaning on tech firms to police content, or banks to drop certain clients, before it crosses the line into unlawful coercion. Ultimately, the recurring examples of extralegal influence – from Operation Choke Point to jawboning Big Tech to presidential vendettas – highlight the importance of clear legal boundaries on government action, even when dealing with powerful corporations.
