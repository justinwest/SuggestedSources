The US government employs various forms of extralegal pressure to influence corporate behavior, operating in the gray area between formal regulation and voluntary compliance. These mechanisms allow government agencies to achieve policy objectives without going through traditional legislative or regulatory processes.

## Regulatory Threats and Informal Guidance

One of the most common forms of extralegal pressure involves regulatory agencies threatening formal action while encouraging "voluntary" compliance. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) frequently uses this approach, issuing guidance letters and making public statements that effectively pressure companies to adopt certain practices without formal rulemaking [1]. Similarly, banking regulators have used supervisory guidance to influence lending practices, with banks understanding that non-compliance could result in more intensive oversight or regulatory action [2].

## Jawboning and Public Pressure

Government officials often use their platforms to publicly pressure corporations, a practice known as "jawboning." President Biden's administration has repeatedly called on oil companies to increase production and reduce prices, while threatening to use emergency powers or pursue windfall profit taxes [3]. The Federal Reserve has historically used moral suasion to influence bank lending practices during economic downturns, relying on the implicit threat of regulatory consequences rather than explicit mandates [4].

## Procurement and Contract Leverage

The government leverages its massive purchasing power to influence corporate behavior beyond the scope of specific contracts. The Biden administration has used federal contracting requirements to push companies toward higher minimum wages, even for non-federal work, by making such practices a factor in contract awards [5]. Defense contractors often face pressure to adopt certain labor practices or supply chain requirements that extend throughout their operations, not just government work [6].

## Antitrust and Investigation Threats

The mere possibility of antitrust investigation or prosecution serves as a powerful tool for influencing corporate behavior. Big Tech companies have modified their business practices in response to congressional hearings and DOJ statements, even without formal charges being filed [7]. The threat of lengthy and costly investigations can be sufficient to encourage companies to alter their conduct proactively [8].

## Financial Regulatory Pressure

Banking regulators employ various informal mechanisms to influence bank behavior. Stress tests, while technically evaluations, effectively function as de facto capital requirements that banks must meet to avoid regulatory scrutiny [9]. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has used consent orders and public enforcement actions to create industry-wide changes in practices, with companies adopting new policies to avoid similar scrutiny [10].

## Environmental and Social Pressure

Environmental agencies often use informal pressure to achieve outcomes that might be difficult to mandate formally. The EPA has negotiated voluntary agreements with industries to reduce emissions or adopt cleaner technologies, with the implicit understanding that failure to cooperate could result in more stringent regulations [11]. Climate-related financial risk guidance from banking regulators has similarly pushed financial institutions to consider environmental factors in their lending and investment decisions [12].

## Tax Policy Leverage

The Treasury Department and IRS have used tax policy implementation to influence corporate behavior beyond tax compliance. The threat of adverse tax treatment or increased scrutiny can pressure companies to adopt certain business structures or practices [13]. International tax enforcement efforts have been used to encourage companies to maintain more domestic operations and employment [14].
