Extralegal pressure refers to government influence on corporations that occurs outside formal legal channels, often through informal threats, regulatory leverage, or public pressure campaigns. The US government has employed various forms of such pressure across different administrations and policy areas.

## Regulatory and Administrative Pressure

One of the most common forms involves regulatory agencies using their discretionary power to pressure companies. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been documented pressuring financial institutions to adopt certain practices through informal guidance rather than formal rulemaking [1]. Similarly, environmental agencies have used the threat of increased scrutiny or delayed permit approvals to encourage corporate compliance with preferred policies beyond legal requirements [2].

Banking regulators have employed "supervisory guidance" that, while not legally binding, effectively functions as mandatory requirements due to the regulatory consequences of non-compliance. The Federal Reserve and other banking agencies have used this approach to influence lending practices, capital allocation, and risk management policies [3].

## Jawboning and Public Pressure

The practice of "jawboning" involves government officials using public statements and moral suasion to influence corporate behavior. Presidents and other high-level officials have frequently criticized companies publicly to pressure them into changing policies on pricing, employment, or social issues [4]. This approach leverages the potential for regulatory retaliation or public backlash without explicit legal action.

Recent examples include pressure on social media companies regarding content moderation policies, where government officials have made public statements suggesting potential regulatory consequences if platforms don't adopt preferred approaches to handling misinformation or political content [5].

## Procurement and Contract Leverage

The federal government's massive purchasing power provides another avenue for extralegal influence. Agencies have used the threat of contract cancellation or exclusion from future bidding processes to pressure contractors on issues ranging from labor practices to political positions [6]. The Department of Defense and other major federal purchasers have leveraged their market position to influence corporate policies that extend beyond the specific terms of government contracts.

## Financial and Tax-Related Pressure

Tax authorities and financial regulators have been documented using audit threats and regulatory scrutiny as leverage. The Internal Revenue Service has faced allegations of targeting certain organizations or individuals based on political considerations, though the extent and intentionality of such practices remain subjects of debate [7]. Financial regulators have similarly used the threat of enhanced oversight or public enforcement actions to encourage compliance with preferred policies.

## Antitrust and Competition Policy

Antitrust enforcement agencies have been accused of using the threat of investigations or enforcement actions to influence corporate behavior in areas beyond traditional competition concerns. The mere announcement of antitrust investigations can significantly impact stock prices and corporate decision-making, creating leverage for regulators even before formal legal proceedings begin [8].

## Industry-Specific Examples

In the technology sector, various agencies have pressured companies on data privacy, content moderation, and market practices through a combination of public statements, regulatory threats, and informal negotiations [9]. The pharmaceutical industry has faced similar pressure regarding drug pricing, with government officials using public criticism and regulatory leverage to influence pricing decisions [10].

The financial services industry has experienced extensive extralegal pressure, particularly following the 2008 financial crisis, where regulators used informal guidance and the threat of enhanced oversight to influence lending practices, executive compensation, and risk management approaches [11].

## Legal and Constitutional Considerations

These practices raise significant constitutional questions about the separation of powers and due process rights. Critics argue that extralegal pressure allows government officials to circumvent normal legislative and regulatory processes, while defenders contend that such informal influence is a legitimate tool of governance [12]. Courts have occasionally intervened when extralegal pressure is deemed to exceed constitutional bounds, but the line between permissible influence and impermissible coercion remains contested.
