The US government has employed various forms of extralegal pressure to influence corporate behavior, operating in gray areas between formal regulation and voluntary compliance. These tactics leverage government power without relying on explicit legal mandates or court orders.

## Regulatory Agency Pressure

Federal agencies frequently use informal pressure tactics to achieve policy goals. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has used "regulation by enforcement" and public statements to influence corporate disclosure practices beyond what securities laws strictly require [1]. Similarly, the Federal Trade Commission has employed consent decrees and public pressure campaigns to shape business practices in areas where formal regulatory authority may be limited [2].

The Environmental Protection Agency has used public shaming campaigns and threat of future regulation to encourage voluntary environmental compliance. Companies often agree to environmental remediation or emissions reductions that exceed legal requirements to avoid negative publicity or potential future litigation [3].

## Financial Sector Pressure

Banking regulators have extensively used informal pressure, particularly following the 2008 financial crisis. The Federal Reserve and other banking agencies employed "supervisory guidance" that, while technically non-binding, carried significant weight with banks due to regulators' examination and enforcement powers [4]. Banks frequently treated this guidance as mandatory to maintain good relationships with their regulators.

Operation Choke Point, conducted by the Department of Justice and banking regulators from 2013-2017, pressured banks to terminate relationships with legal businesses deemed "high-risk," including payday lenders and gun retailers, without formal legal proceedings [5].

## Technology and Social Media

Government officials have increasingly used public statements and private communications to pressure technology companies regarding content moderation. The Biden administration has publicly called on social media platforms to remove COVID-19 "misinformation," while congressional hearings have featured implicit threats of regulation if companies don't voluntarily adopt preferred policies [6].

The Federal Trade Commission has used broad interpretations of consumer protection authority to investigate and pressure technology companies regarding data privacy practices, often securing voluntary commitments that exceed current legal requirements [7].

## Defense and National Security

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) wields significant informal influence over corporate mergers and acquisitions involving foreign entities. Companies often voluntarily restructure or abandon deals based on informal signals about likely CFIUS opposition, avoiding formal review processes [8].

Defense contractors face pressure to adopt specific labor, environmental, and social policies through government contracting requirements and informal guidance, leveraging the government's position as a major purchaser [9].

## Tax and Trade Policy

The Internal Revenue Service has used public statements and selective enforcement to discourage certain tax strategies that may be technically legal but viewed as inappropriate. The "name and shame" approach includes publishing lists of abusive tax shelters and promoters [10].

Trade agencies have used threats of tariffs, investigations, and public criticism to pressure companies to change sourcing practices or pricing strategies, particularly regarding imports from specific countries [11].

## Congressional Pressure

Congressional committees regularly use hearings, public statements, and private communications to pressure corporations. This includes threats of legislation, investigation, or adverse publicity to encourage voluntary corporate policy changes. The pharmaceutical industry has faced repeated congressional pressure regarding drug pricing, leading to voluntary price rollbacks and policy changes [12].
