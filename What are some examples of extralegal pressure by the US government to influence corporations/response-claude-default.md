Extralegal pressure refers to government influence on corporations that operates outside formal legal channels, using informal mechanisms, regulatory discretion, and implicit threats rather than explicit laws or court orders. The US government has employed various forms of such pressure across different administrations and policy areas.

## Regulatory Jawboning and Informal Pressure

One of the most common forms of extralegal pressure is "jawboning" - using public statements, meetings, and informal communications to influence corporate behavior. The Obama administration notably pressured banks to limit lending to certain industries deemed harmful, including payday lenders and gun manufacturers, through what became known as "Operation Choke Point." This initiative involved banking regulators informing banks that certain business relationships carried reputational risks, effectively discouraging financial services to these sectors without formal prohibitions [1].

The Trump administration similarly used informal pressure, particularly through social media and public statements. President Trump frequently criticized specific companies on Twitter, leading to measurable stock price fluctuations and behavioral changes. Examples included pressure on pharmaceutical companies regarding drug pricing, criticism of defense contractors over cost overruns, and threats against technology companies over content moderation policies [2].

## Content Moderation and Social Media Platforms

Recent years have seen significant government pressure on social media platforms regarding content moderation, particularly around misinformation, hate speech, and political content. Government officials from both parties have called social media executives to testify before Congress and have made public statements suggesting that platforms should remove or restrict certain types of content. This pressure operates in a legal gray area, as the First Amendment typically prohibits government censorship, but the line becomes blurred when platforms voluntarily comply with government suggestions [3].

The Biden administration has faced criticism for its communications with social media platforms regarding COVID-19 misinformation, with some arguing that government officials' requests for content removal constituted unconstitutional pressure on private companies to censor speech [4].

## Financial Sector Pressure

Banking regulators routinely use informal guidance and supervisory pressure to influence bank behavior beyond what formal regulations require. This includes discouraging certain types of lending, encouraging others, and pressuring banks to maintain higher capital ratios than legally mandated. The Federal Reserve and other regulators often communicate expectations through speeches, informal meetings, and supervisory guidance that, while not legally binding, carry significant weight due to regulators' authority over bank operations [5].

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing has become another area where government officials have applied informal pressure, with some encouraging financial institutions to consider climate risks in their lending decisions and others pushing back against ESG considerations [6].

## Tax Policy and Corporate Behavior

The Treasury Department and IRS have used interpretive guidance and enforcement discretion to influence corporate behavior in ways that go beyond statutory requirements. This includes issuing guidance that discourages certain tax strategies, selectively enforcing existing rules, and making public statements about corporate tax practices to create reputational pressure [7].

## Antitrust and Competition Policy

Antitrust agencies often use the threat of investigation or enforcement action to influence corporate behavior, even when formal legal action might not succeed. Companies may abandon mergers, change business practices, or alter their competitive strategies in response to informal pressure from the Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission, often preferring to avoid the costs and uncertainty of prolonged legal battles [8].

## Limitations and Constitutional Concerns

While extralegal pressure can be an effective policy tool, it raises significant constitutional and governance concerns. Critics argue that it allows government officials to circumvent legislative processes, constitutional protections, and judicial oversight. The lack of formal procedures means there are often no clear appeals processes or transparency requirements, potentially leading to arbitrary or politically motivated actions [9].

Legal scholars have noted that such pressure can be particularly problematic when it effectively coerces speech or censorship, as it may violate First Amendment protections while providing the government with plausible deniability since no formal legal action was taken [10].
