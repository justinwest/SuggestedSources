# ü§ñ Claude's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

The US government has employed various forms of extralegal pressure to influence corporate behavior across multiple sectors and administrations. These tactics operate in legal gray areas, often using regulatory authority, informal communications, or implied threats to achieve policy objectives without formal legal proceedings.

## Financial Sector Targeting

**Operation Choke Point** represents one of the most documented examples of systematic extralegal pressure. Under the Obama administration, the Department of Justice and banking regulators pressured financial institutions to terminate relationships with legal but disfavored businesses, including payday lenders, firearms dealers, and adult entertainment companies [1][7]. Banks received guidance suggesting these industries posed "reputational risk," leading many to sever ties with legitimate businesses to avoid regulatory scrutiny [1].

The program's reach extended beyond its original scope. Banking regulators sent letters and conducted examinations that effectively discouraged banks from serving entire industries, even when those businesses operated legally [7]. This created a de facto boycott without formal legal action or due process.

Similar tactics have reportedly been used against cryptocurrency companies in what critics call "Operation Choke Point 2.0." Banking regulators have allegedly pressured financial institutions to limit services to crypto businesses, with the FDIC facing particular scrutiny for its communications with banks regarding digital asset companies [6].

## Content Moderation and Social Media

Government pressure on social media platforms to moderate content represents another significant area of extralegal influence. Mark Zuckerberg revealed that the Biden administration "repeatedly pressured" Meta to censor COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, which the company later regretted removing [4]. This pressure was part of broader government efforts to influence online speech during the pandemic.

The "Twitter Files" revelations exposed extensive communication between government agencies and Twitter (now X) regarding content moderation decisions [10]. These documents showed how federal agencies regularly flagged content for potential removal, blurring the lines between government influence and private platform policies.

A federal judge found this relationship so problematic that they issued an injunction restricting White House communications with social media companies, determining that government officials had likely violated First Amendment rights by pressuring platforms to remove content [5].

## Defense Contracting and Employment

The Obama and Trump administrations both used informal pressure tactics regarding defense industry employment decisions. In 2012, the White House convinced Lockheed Martin to delay issuing federally-required layoff notices until after the presidential election, despite legal obligations under the WARN Act [11]. The administration reportedly promised to cover any legal costs resulting from the delay [14].

Similarly, the Trump administration pressured companies like Carrier (United Technologies) to reverse decisions to move manufacturing overseas, using a combination of tax incentives and implied threats regarding future government contracts [12][13].

## Tax Enforcement as Political Tool

The IRS targeting controversy demonstrated how tax enforcement powers could be used for political purposes. The agency subjected conservative political groups to enhanced scrutiny when applying for tax-exempt status, creating significant delays and requesting extensive documentation not required of other organizations [8]. This represented a form of bureaucratic pressure that effectively limited these groups' activities without formal legal action.

## Corporate Speech and WikiLeaks

Following WikiLeaks' publication of classified documents, major corporations like Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and Amazon terminated services to the organization without legal requirements to do so [3]. While companies claimed independent decision-making, the coordinated nature of these actions and their timing suggested government influence, effectively creating a financial blockade against WikiLeaks.

These examples illustrate how federal agencies and officials can leverage regulatory authority, informal communications, and implied consequences to influence corporate behavior outside formal legal channels. Such tactics raise significant concerns about due process, separation of powers, and the potential for government overreach in a market economy.

**Examples of extralegal pressure by the U.S. government on corporations include:**

1. **Operation Choke Point (2013‚Äì2017):** The U.S. Department of Justice secretly launched *Operation Choke Point* to ‚Äúchoke off‚Äù certain legal businesses from banking services without new laws or formal regulations. Banks were leaned on to terminate relationships with lawful but ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù industries (e.g. payday lenders, firearms dealers) by warning that serving them posed *reputational risk* that could trigger federal investigations [1]. In effect, regulators‚Äô informal guidance became an **implicit threat** ‚Äì banks were told (behind the scenes) that continuing to bank these companies might invite tougher scrutiny. As a result, many banks abruptly shut down accounts of businesses that had broken no law, effectively pressuring those companies to quit those lines of business or be **de-banked** [2]. This extralegal program drew heavy criticism and was ultimately shut down; the FDIC even settled lawsuits by agreeing to stop issuing ‚Äúinformal‚Äù unwritten suggestions to banks about which legal customers to avoid, an admission that the earlier pressure had overstepped proper authority [1].

2. **WikiLeaks Financial Blockade (2010):** After WikiLeaks published classified U.S. government cables, American officials (formally and informally) pressured private firms to cut off the site‚Äôs access to infrastructure and funds. For example, Senator Joe Lieberman publicly urged companies to stop servicing WikiLeaks ‚Äì and indeed, Amazon abruptly **removed WikiLeaks from its web servers** following government criticism, and payment processors like Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal **suspended WikiLeaks‚Äô accounts** even though no court had ordered them to do so [3]. This **financial blockade** severely disrupted WikiLeaks‚Äô operations by choking off donations and web hosting. Observers noted that these corporations appeared to be acting ‚Äúin response to a public request‚Äù from officials and out of fear of being seen as aiding an enemy of the state, rather than due to any legal requirement [3]. In other words, U.S. authorities used public pressure and behind-the-scenes warnings to induce companies to do what the government could not directly mandate ‚Äì effectively censoring WikiLeaks by *extralegal means*.

3. **Pressure on Social Media to Censor Content (2020‚Äì2023):** There have been multiple instances of government officials pushing social media platforms to remove or suppress certain content outside any legal process. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic the Biden White House and other officials **repeatedly urged** Facebook/Meta to *remove posts* they deemed ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù about COVID ‚Äì even including humorous or satirical content ‚Äì despite such speech being legally protected [4]. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg later revealed that his company felt ‚Äúpressured‚Äù by senior administration officials to censor certain COVID-19 discussions, and he expressed regret for complying with some of those takedown requests, calling the government pressure ‚Äúwrong‚Äù [4]. In a related vein, internal files from Twitter (the ‚ÄúTwitter Files‚Äù released in 2022) showed that agencies like the FBI regularly **flagged tweets and accounts** to Twitter for moderation, and one Twitter executive described the close cooperation as *‚Äúgovernment‚Äìindustry sync‚Äù* due to the constant contact [8]. This unofficial coordination led to Twitter sometimes suppressing content (e.g. posts about elections or the Hunter Biden laptop story) at the behest of government actors, raising concerns that authorities were skirting First Amendment limits by using private platforms as proxies. In mid-2023, a federal judge responded to evidence of such contacts by **barring** certain Biden administration agencies and officials from communicating with social-media companies about moderating protected speech. The judge found that the government had likely ‚Äúgone too far‚Äù in pressing platforms to delete or downgrade content, and the injunction aimed to stop officials from encouraging censorship of *‚Äúdissenting views‚Äù* under the guise of combating misinformation [5].

4. **‚ÄúOperation Choke Point 2.0‚Äù (Crypto Industry, 2022‚Äì2023):** More recently, figures in the cryptocurrency industry have accused U.S. regulators of running an *unofficial crackdown* to isolate crypto businesses from the banking system ‚Äì a campaign they‚Äôve dubbed **Operation Choke Point 2.0**. While not formally acknowledged by government, evidence has emerged that regulators quietly **pressured banks to distance themselves from crypto clients**. In 2022, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) privately asked nearly two dozen banks to **‚Äúpause‚Äù or limit their crypto-related activities**, according to letters later obtained via FOIA requests [6]. This informal guidance (issued after high-profile crypto collapses) effectively discouraged banks from doing business with legitimate crypto exchanges and firms, without any law or new rule stating they must do so. Crypto advocates argue that the coordinated timing ‚Äì including the sudden closures or debanking of major crypto-friendly banks ‚Äì indicates a *de facto* policy to strangle the crypto sector‚Äôs access to finance, much like the original Operation Choke Point targeted other industries [6]. Regulators deny any unlawful targeting, but the practice of quietly warning banks off entire lawful sectors (rather than case-by-case enforcement) is seen as extralegal pressure, since it leverages supervisory power to achieve policy aims not enacted by Congress.

5. **IRS Targeting Controversy (2010‚Äì2013):** Another example often cited as extralegal pressure was the IRS‚Äôs treatment of certain non-profit organizations based on their political leanings. An internal audit in 2013 revealed that IRS officials had singled out applications from conservative-leaning groups (especially those with names like ‚ÄúTea Party‚Äù or ‚ÄúPatriots‚Äù) for **extra scrutiny and delays** when they applied for tax-exempt status [7]. This **selective targeting** was not mandated by any law or policy ‚Äì in fact, it violated standard, neutral procedure ‚Äì and appeared to be driven by political bias inside the agency. Dozens of conservative groups experienced long delays or intrusive questions, effectively impeding their activities during the 2012 election cycle. When this practice came to light, it caused a scandal: the IRS apologized, and investigations confirmed that inappropriate criteria had been used to flag groups (primarily on the right, though some left-leaning names were flagged too) [7]. Critics characterized this as extralegal harassment by government officials ‚Äì using the IRS‚Äôs vast discretionary power to **burden or intimidate certain organizations** without any legal justification, thereby influencing which voices in civil society could operate freely.

# ü§ñ Gemini's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

Based on the provided sources, the U.S. government has used various forms of extralegal pressure to influence corporate behavior. These actions, which fall outside of formal laws or regulations, often involve using the government's authority and public platform to persuade or coerce companies on matters ranging from financial services and content moderation to employment and manufacturing decisions.

Examples of this pressure include:

### 1. Pressure on Financial Institutions and Services

*   **Operation Choke Point**: This was a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) initiative started in 2013. Officially, its goal was to combat mass-market consumer fraud by investigating banks that did business with companies engaged in fraudulent activities [9]. However, a 2014 report from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform concluded that the DOJ and regulators secretly pressured banks to terminate relationships with legal, but politically disfavored, businesses, including firearm dealers, payday lenders, and other financial services companies [1, 7]. Regulators would flag these industries as "high-risk," leading banks to close their accounts to avoid heightened government scrutiny [1, 9].
*   **"Operation Choke Point 2.0"**: Crypto-industry advocates and some banking executives have used this term to describe what they perceive as a coordinated, but informal, effort by financial regulators under the Biden administration to discourage banks from offering services to cryptocurrency firms [2, 6]. This alleged pressure involves regulators issuing public warnings about the risks of crypto and subjecting banks with crypto clients to intense supervisory scrutiny, leading some banks to "de-bank" or avoid crypto customers altogether [2, 6].
*   **Cutting Services to WikiLeaks**: In 2010, after WikiLeaks published a trove of sensitive diplomatic cables, U.S. officials, including Senator Joe Lieberman, publicly called for companies to stop providing services to the organization. Following this pressure, companies including Amazon, PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard suspended services for WikiLeaks, significantly hindering its ability to operate and collect donations [3].

### 2. Pressure on Tech Companies and Content Moderation

*   **COVID-19 Content Censorship**: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Biden administration pressured the company to remove content, including posts that were true but inconvenient for the administration's public health messaging. He stated the White House threatened regulatory action if Meta did not increase its content censorship efforts [4]. This pressure campaign was extensive enough that in 2023, a federal judge issued an injunction restricting White House and other government officials from communicating with social media companies for the purpose of "encouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech" [5].
*   **The "Twitter Files"**: Internal documents from Twitter released in 2022 revealed frequent and regular communications between the company and multiple U.S. government agencies, including the FBI [10]. These communications included requests from the government to review or take action on specific accounts and posts related to topics like election integrity and foreign influence operations [10].

### 3. Pressure on Business Operations and Employment

*   **Delaying Layoff Notices**: In 2012, the Obama administration successfully requested that major defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin, delay sending legally required layoff notices to workers ahead of the presidential election [11, 14]. The potential layoffs were due to looming automatic budget cuts (sequestration), and the administration gave the companies assurances that they would be covered for any associated legal costs [11].
*   **Manufacturing Plant Locations**: As President-elect, Donald Trump publicly pressured and negotiated with the air conditioning manufacturer Carrier to prevent it from moving a plant from Indiana to Mexico. The effort involved a mix of public pressure via his "bully pulpit" and a deal for $7 million in state tax incentives. The parent company of Carrier, United Technologies, was also a major federal defense contractor, a fact Trump referenced in his campaign to keep the jobs in the U.S. [12]. Similarly, President Trump publicly threatened to cut federal subsidies to General Motors after it announced plant closures and layoffs in 2018 [13].

### 4. Pressure through Regulatory Scrutiny

*   **IRS Targeting Controversy**: A 2013 Treasury Inspector General report found that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had used inappropriate criteria to identify for extra scrutiny the tax-exempt status applications of organizations with names including "Tea Party" or "Patriots" [8]. While targeting non-profit political groups rather than for-profit corporations, it serves as an example of a federal agency using its regulatory power to exert pressure on specific types of organizations based on their political leanings [8].

### Examples of Extralegal Pressure by the US Government on Corporations

Extralegal pressure refers to informal or indirect methods used by government entities to influence corporate behavior without relying on formal legal mechanisms like legislation, court orders, or regulations. This can include threats, persuasion, or leveraging government relationships to encourage compliance. Below, I outline several documented examples, grouped thematically for clarity. These are drawn from historical and recent cases, primarily involving financial services, content moderation, and economic decisions. While some actions were later scrutinized or ruled upon by courts, they illustrate instances where pressure was applied outside traditional legal channels.

#### 1. Financial Sector Pressure (Operation Choke Point and Related Programs)
Operation Choke Point was a Department of Justice (DOJ) initiative launched in 2013 under the Obama administration, aimed at curbing fraud by pressuring banks to sever ties with certain "high-risk" businesses, such as payday lenders, firearms dealers, and others. Critics argued it involved extralegal tactics, like informal warnings or threats to banks' reputations and operations, without formal charges against the businesses.

- **Pressure on Banks to Cut Off Payday Lenders**: Federal regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), reportedly threatened banks with increased scrutiny or account closures if they continued servicing payday lenders. For instance, banks were told to "quit the business or we'll close your account," leading to widespread terminations of relationships with legal but disfavored industries [1][7][9].
  
- **Alleged "Operation Choke Point 2.0" in Cryptocurrency**: Similar tactics have been alleged in the crypto sector under the Biden administration. The FDIC reportedly sent letters to banks discouraging crypto-related activities, prompting claims from companies like Coinbase that this constituted informal pressure to "choke" crypto firms' access to banking services without explicit legal bans [2][6].

- **IRS Targeting of Conservative Groups**: In the IRS targeting controversy (2010‚Äì2013), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under the Obama administration applied heightened scrutiny and delays to tax-exempt applications from conservative political groups, such as Tea Party organizations. This was seen as extralegal pressure, as it involved selective enforcement without formal policy changes, later leading to apologies and settlements [8].

#### 2. Content Moderation and Censorship on Social Media Platforms
Government officials have been accused of pressuring tech companies to moderate content, often through informal communications rather than legal mandates, raising First Amendment concerns.

- **Pressure on Meta (Facebook) Regarding COVID-19 Content**: In 2021, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that the Biden administration repeatedly pressured the company to censor COVID-19-related posts, including humor and satire, which Meta resisted in some cases but complied with in others. This involved senior officials "expressing frustration" when demands weren't met [4]. A federal judge later issued an injunction limiting such White House communications with social media firms, citing potential coercion [5].

- **Twitter Files Revelations**: The "Twitter Files," released in 2022, documented how federal agencies like the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) informally requested Twitter (now X) to suppress certain content, including election-related misinformation and COVID-19 narratives. This pressure was exerted through regular meetings and emails, influencing moderation decisions without court orders [10].

- **WikiLeaks and Payment Processors**: In 2010, following WikiLeaks' release of classified documents, the US government reportedly pressured companies like Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal to block donations to WikiLeaks. This was done through informal channels, such as congressional letters and public statements, leading to voluntary cutoffs despite no formal charges against WikiLeaks at the time [3].

#### 3. Influence on Corporate Employment and Business Decisions
Presidents and administrations have used public pressure, threats of policy changes, or direct negotiations to influence corporate decisions on jobs and operations.

- **Lockheed Martin Layoff Notices**: In 2012, under the Obama administration, the White House requested that defense contractor Lockheed Martin delay issuing layoff notices ahead of the presidential election, citing potential job cuts from sequestration. Lockheed complied after the administration offered to cover legal costs, a move critics called extralegal interference to avoid negative publicity [11][14].

- **Carrier Corporation Job Retention**: In 2016, then-President-elect Donald Trump publicly pressured Carrier (a subsidiary of United Technologies) to keep manufacturing jobs in Indiana rather than moving them to Mexico. Through tweets, calls, and threats of tariffs or loss of government contracts, Trump influenced the company to retain about 800 jobs, though some relocation still occurred [12].

- **Amazon and Government Contracts**: In 2018, President Trump reportedly pressured the Pentagon to deny Amazon a $10 billion cloud computing contract (JEDI), citing personal animosity toward Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos (owner of The Washington Post). This involved public criticisms and informal directives, leading to lawsuits and the contract's eventual cancellation [13].

These examples highlight a pattern where government entities use leverage like regulatory threats, public shaming, or promises of benefits to influence corporations. While some actions were defended as legitimate oversight, others faced backlash, investigations, or judicial restrictions for overstepping legal bounds. For instance, Operation Choke Point was officially ended in 2017 amid congressional criticism [9], and court rulings have limited government-social media interactions [5]. Additional context from sources like congressional reports underscores concerns about secrecy and potential abuse of power [7].

If more examples are needed, further research could explore cases like the Trump administration's pressure on AT&T regarding its merger with Time Warner, as reported in outlets like The New York Times [15], which alleged interference due to CNN's coverage.

# ü§ñ Claude's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

Extralegal pressure refers to government influence on corporations that occurs outside formal legal channels, often through informal threats, regulatory leverage, or public pressure campaigns. The US government has employed various forms of such pressure across different administrations and policy areas.

## Regulatory and Administrative Pressure

One of the most common forms involves regulatory agencies using their discretionary power to pressure companies. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been documented pressuring financial institutions to adopt certain practices through informal guidance rather than formal rulemaking [1]. Similarly, environmental agencies have used the threat of increased scrutiny or delayed permit approvals to encourage corporate compliance with preferred policies beyond legal requirements [2].

Banking regulators have employed "supervisory guidance" that, while not legally binding, effectively functions as mandatory requirements due to the regulatory consequences of non-compliance. The Federal Reserve and other banking agencies have used this approach to influence lending practices, capital allocation, and risk management policies [3].

## Jawboning and Public Pressure

The practice of "jawboning" involves government officials using public statements and moral suasion to influence corporate behavior. Presidents and other high-level officials have frequently criticized companies publicly to pressure them into changing policies on pricing, employment, or social issues [4]. This approach leverages the potential for regulatory retaliation or public backlash without explicit legal action.

Recent examples include pressure on social media companies regarding content moderation policies, where government officials have made public statements suggesting potential regulatory consequences if platforms don't adopt preferred approaches to handling misinformation or political content [5].

## Procurement and Contract Leverage

The federal government's massive purchasing power provides another avenue for extralegal influence. Agencies have used the threat of contract cancellation or exclusion from future bidding processes to pressure contractors on issues ranging from labor practices to political positions [6]. The Department of Defense and other major federal purchasers have leveraged their market position to influence corporate policies that extend beyond the specific terms of government contracts.

## Financial and Tax-Related Pressure

Tax authorities and financial regulators have been documented using audit threats and regulatory scrutiny as leverage. The Internal Revenue Service has faced allegations of targeting certain organizations or individuals based on political considerations, though the extent and intentionality of such practices remain subjects of debate [7]. Financial regulators have similarly used the threat of enhanced oversight or public enforcement actions to encourage compliance with preferred policies.

## Antitrust and Competition Policy

Antitrust enforcement agencies have been accused of using the threat of investigations or enforcement actions to influence corporate behavior in areas beyond traditional competition concerns. The mere announcement of antitrust investigations can significantly impact stock prices and corporate decision-making, creating leverage for regulators even before formal legal proceedings begin [8].

## Industry-Specific Examples

In the technology sector, various agencies have pressured companies on data privacy, content moderation, and market practices through a combination of public statements, regulatory threats, and informal negotiations [9]. The pharmaceutical industry has faced similar pressure regarding drug pricing, with government officials using public criticism and regulatory leverage to influence pricing decisions [10].

The financial services industry has experienced extensive extralegal pressure, particularly following the 2008 financial crisis, where regulators used informal guidance and the threat of enhanced oversight to influence lending practices, executive compensation, and risk management approaches [11].

## Legal and Constitutional Considerations

These practices raise significant constitutional questions about the separation of powers and due process rights. Critics argue that extralegal pressure allows government officials to circumvent normal legislative and regulatory processes, while defenders contend that such informal influence is a legitimate tool of governance [12]. Courts have occasionally intervened when extralegal pressure is deemed to exceed constitutional bounds, but the line between permissible influence and impermissible coercion remains contested.

Extralegal pressure refers to government officials using informal or coercive tactics ‚Äì outside the normal legal or legislative process ‚Äì to sway corporate behavior. Over the years, U.S. administrations have at times influenced companies through such means. Here are a few notable examples:

**1. Operation Choke Point (2013-2017):** This was an Obama-era Department of Justice (DOJ) initiative that leveraged bank regulators to cut off banking services for certain industries the administration deemed undesirable (even though those businesses were lawful) ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20Operation%20Choke%20Point%20was,every%20business%20needs%20to%20survive)). Under Operation Choke Point, regulators labeled various legal sectors ‚Äì from payday lenders and gun retailers to coin dealers ‚Äì as ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù and warned banks of **‚Äúreputational risk‚Äù**, implicitly threatening federal investigations if they didn‚Äôt drop those clients ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=merchants%20creates%20a%20%E2%80%9Creputational%20risk%E2%80%9D,threat%20of%20a%20federal%20investigation)) ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20The%20Department%20lacks%20adequate,expanded%20its%20Section%20951%20authority)). Internal memos showed officials knew the policy was forcing banks to exit entire lines of legal business ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20The%20Department%20is%20aware,%E2%80%9Chigh%20risk%E2%80%9D%20by%20the%20government)). Critics argue this was **extralegal coercion**: rather than outlawing these industries through legislation, agencies informally **intimidated banks** into denying services, effectively choking off the targeted businesses‚Äô access to finance ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20Operation%20Choke%20Point%20was,every%20business%20needs%20to%20survive)) ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnberlau/2018/10/31/choke-point-is-frightening-precedent-for-bank-regulatory-abuse/#:~:text=Yet%20after%20reading%20through%20new,access%20to%20the%20banking%20system)). A House Oversight report concluded DOJ **‚Äúlacked adequate legal authority‚Äù** for this program and had stretched its statutory powers beyond their limits ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20The%20Department%20lacks%20adequate,expanded%20its%20Section%20951%20authority)). Operation Choke Point was eventually wound down amid backlash, with observers calling it a ‚Äúfrightening‚Äù precedent for regulatory abuse via informal pressure ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnberlau/2018/10/31/choke-point-is-frightening-precedent-for-bank-regulatory-abuse/#:~:text=Yet%20after%20reading%20through%20new,access%20to%20the%20banking%20system)).

**2. Government ‚ÄúJawboning‚Äù of Tech Platforms:** U.S. officials have often applied extralegal pressure on social media and tech companies to moderate content. **‚ÄúJawboning‚Äù** is the term for when authorities use their influence ‚Äì not laws ‚Äì to push private platforms to take down or restrict certain speech ([www.lawfaremedia.org](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/informal-government-coercion-and-problem-jawboning#:~:text=For%20years%20now%2C%20scholars%20have,the%20social%20media%20companies%20do)). For example, members of Congress and executive agencies have **urged or warned social media companies** to remove content deemed misinformation, hate speech, or otherwise harmful, under implied threats of regulation or legal action ([www.lawfaremedia.org](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/informal-government-coercion-and-problem-jawboning#:~:text=For%20years%20now%2C%20scholars%20have,the%20social%20media%20companies%20do)) ([www.eff.org](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/06/when-jawboning-creates-private-liability?language=ar#:~:text=Among%20the%20state%20actor%20theories,they%20act%20according%20to%20it)). In 2021, the Biden administration‚Äôs Surgeon General and White House officials publicly **pressured Facebook** to speed up removal of COVID-19 vaccine falsehoods, even flagging specific ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù posts and accounts for the platform to act on ([www.lawfaremedia.org](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/informal-government-coercion-and-problem-jawboning#:~:text=The%20second%20jawboning,the%20First%20Amendment%20rights%20of)). This raised debates about whether such informal directives crossed into coercion that violates the First Amendment (since the government can‚Äôt directly censor speech) ([www.lawfaremedia.org](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/informal-government-coercion-and-problem-jawboning#:~:text=The%20second%20jawboning,the%20First%20Amendment%20rights%20of)). A notable case, *Missouri v. Biden*, alleged that federal officials **‚Äúcoerced‚Äù social platforms** to censor disfavored viewpoints on pandemic and election topics ([www.lawfaremedia.org](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/it-depends-who-s-doing-the-jawboning#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20on%20March,federal%20government%20asserts%20that%20the)). A lower court initially found that officials likely went beyond mere persuasion and **‚Äúsignificantly encouraged‚Äù** private censorship, issuing an injunction to halt certain contacts ([www.lawfaremedia.org](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/it-depends-who-s-doing-the-jawboning#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20on%20March,federal%20government%20asserts%20that%20the)). (That order was later put on hold, and the Supreme Court ultimately set aside the case on procedural grounds, but the controversy underscored the blurry line between advice and pressure ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-wont-curb-biden-administration-social-media-contacts-2024-06-26/#:~:text=The%20U,allows%20the%20administration%20to%20continue)).) Similarly, during previous administrations, lawmakers threatened to weaken tech companies‚Äô legal protections (like Section 230 immunity) or pursue antitrust actions if platforms didn‚Äôt address content issues to their satisfaction. This kind of *arms-length influence* ‚Äì using political clout and public shaming rather than statutes ‚Äì exemplifies extralegal pressure on corporations to change policies. Digital rights advocates warn that such **informal government intervention** in content moderation, even if well-intentioned, can become ‚Äú**a system of informal censorship**‚Äù incompatible with free-speech norms ([www.eff.org](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/06/when-jawboning-creates-private-liability?language=ar#:~:text=suits%20against%20government%20agencies%20and,processing%20payments%20to%20the%20website)).

**3. Presidential Bullying and Retaliation:** U.S. presidents have at times directly pressured companies through extralegal means, often via the ‚Äúbully pulpit‚Äù or behind-the-scenes leverage. A classic example is **President John F. Kennedy‚Äôs clash with U.S. Steel in 1962**. After the steel industry announced a sudden price hike that JFK felt would damage the economy, he reacted with public fury and private threats. Kennedy lambasted the move as a ‚Äúwholly unjustifiable‚Ä¶defiance of the public interest,‚Äù and his administration hinted at reprisals, including antitrust scrutiny and shifting government steel orders to competitors ([www.peoplesworld.org](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/how-jfk-forced-steel-price-roll-back/#:~:text=was%20biting%20%E2%80%93%20but%20he,even%20more%20caustic%20in%20private)) ([time.com](https://time.com/archive/6627918/steel-the-price-fixing-verdict/#:~:text=Since%20John%20F,a%20big%2C%20if%20qualified%2C%20victory)). Under this intense pressure, the major steel companies backed down and rolled back the price increase ‚Äì a victory achieved not by any new law, but by presidential **jawboning and the implicit threat of government action** ([time.com](https://time.com/archive/6627918/steel-the-price-fixing-verdict/#:~:text=Since%20John%20F,a%20big%2C%20if%20qualified%2C%20victory)). Another example is **President Richard Nixon‚Äôs attempts to retaliate against media corporations** critical of him. Angered by *The Washington Post*‚Äôs Watergate reporting, Nixon‚Äôs allies secretly tried to **challenge the broadcast licenses** of television stations owned by the Post‚Äôs parent company in 1973 ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/#:~:text=But%20here%27s%20the%20thing%3A%20That,were%20The%20Washington%20Post%20Co)). While the White House denied orchestrating it, the timing and connections made it clear this was a form of presidential harassment ‚Äì using regulatory processes and proxies to punish a company for its journalism ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/#:~:text=In%201973%2C%20the%20Associated%20Press,Watergate%20investigation%20of%20the%20president)) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/#:~:text=Nixon%27s%20press%20secretary%2C%20Ronald%20Ziegler%2C,%E2%80%9CNo%2C%20absolutely%20not%2C%E2%80%9D%20Ziegler%20assured)). Fast forward to recent years, **President Donald Trump** also repeatedly pressured or threatened companies without formal legal basis. He **mused about revoking NBC‚Äôs broadcast licenses** after negative coverage, and he attacked Amazon (owned by Post owner Jeff Bezos) with calls for higher postal rates and antitrust scrutiny, largely to pressure Bezos over *Washington Post* coverage ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2017/12/15/why-trump-cant-revoke-nbcs-broadcast-licenses-1513306121#:~:text=President%20Trump%20questioned%20the%20appropriateness,than%20implied%20by%20Trump%27s%20statements)). Trump‚Äôs 2017 tweets about limiting network licenses were widely condemned as ‚ÄúNixonian,‚Äù since they so closely paralleled Nixon‚Äôs tactics of using extralegal levers against unfriendly media ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/#:~:text=President%20Trump%20is%20yet%20again,to%20attempt%20in%20the%201970s)). In all these cases ‚Äì Kennedy with steel producers, Nixon/Trump with press outlets, and others ‚Äì the presidents sought to **influence corporate decisions through intimidation, public shaming, or implied regulatory retaliation rather than through duly enacted law** ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/#:~:text=President%20Trump%20is%20yet%20again,to%20attempt%20in%20the%201970s)) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/#:~:text=But%20here%27s%20the%20thing%3A%20That,were%20The%20Washington%20Post%20Co)).

Each of the above illustrates extralegal pressure: government actors stepping outside normal legislative or judicial channels to strong-arm corporations. Such pressure can be effective, but it is controversial because it evades accountability and tests the limits of the rule of law. Critics from across the political spectrum argue that when officials **‚Äúharass‚Äù or threaten private businesses into compliance without legal authority, it undermines transparency and the constitutional checks on government power ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20The%20Department%20lacks%20adequate,expanded%20its%20Section%20951%20authority)) ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnberlau/2018/10/31/choke-point-is-frightening-precedent-for-bank-regulatory-abuse/#:~:text=Yet%20after%20reading%20through%20new,access%20to%20the%20banking%20system)). On the other hand, some officials defend informal pressure as a quick way to serve the public interest (for instance, urging voluntary action on urgent problems when legislation is slow or absent) ([www.americanbar.org](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/administrative_law/resources/administrative-law-review/2023-spring/operation-choke-point-myths-reality/#:~:text=This%20Article%20is%20an%20attempt,Backlash%20erupted)) ([www.americanbar.org](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/administrative_law/resources/administrative-law-review/2023-spring/operation-choke-point-myths-reality/#:~:text=a%20benign%20initiative%20involving%20a,The%20gun%20industry)). The tension between those views continues in current debates ‚Äì for example, how far the government can go in leaning on tech firms to police content, or banks to drop certain clients, before it crosses the line into unlawful coercion. Ultimately, the recurring examples of extralegal influence ‚Äì from Operation Choke Point to jawboning Big Tech to presidential vendettas ‚Äì highlight the importance of clear legal boundaries on government action, even when dealing with powerful corporations.

# ü§ñ Gemini's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

Extralegal pressure by the U.S. government refers to actions taken by officials to influence corporate behavior without passing a specific law or obtaining a court order. This form of influence leverages the government's immense power‚Äîincluding its ability to regulate, investigate, award contracts, and shape public opinion‚Äîto persuade or coerce companies into acting in a way that aligns with the administration's goals. This pressure can be subtle or overt and has been used by administrations of both political parties.

Here are some prominent examples of extralegal pressure by the US government on corporations:

### 1. Public Statements and "Jawboning"
"Jawboning" is the use of public speeches, statements, or social media posts by high-level officials (especially the President) to pressure corporations. By publicly praising or shaming a company, the government can affect its stock price, public reputation, and consumer behavior, thereby compelling it to change course.

*   **Kennedy vs. U.S. Steel (1962):** When U.S. Steel announced a significant price increase, President John F. Kennedy publicly denounced the move as a "wholly unjustifiable and irresponsible defiance of the public interest" during a press conference. He coupled this public shaming with threats of antitrust investigations and shifting government contracts to competing steel companies. Within days, U.S. Steel rescinded the price hike [1]. This is considered a classic example of successful presidential jawboning.

*   **Trump Administration's Use of Social Media:** President Donald Trump frequently used his Twitter account to criticize or praise individual companies for their business decisions. He attacked companies like Harley-Davidson for moving production overseas and Amazon for its business practices, often leading to immediate, albeit sometimes temporary, dips in their stock prices. Conversely, he praised companies like Carrier for keeping jobs in the U.S. (after they received state tax incentives), using the presidential platform to directly influence corporate decision-making on manufacturing and employment [2].

### 2. Threats of Regulatory Action and Investigation
Government agencies can pressure industries by signaling their intent to launch investigations, enact burdensome regulations, or revoke licenses. Even without formal action, the threat can be enough to force compliance, as companies seek to avoid costly legal battles and reputational damage.

*   **Operation Choke Point (2013-2017):** This initiative by the Department of Justice (DOJ) aimed to combat consumer fraud by pressuring banks and payment processors to cut ties with businesses deemed "high-risk," such as payday lenders, firearms dealers, and other legal but politically disfavored industries. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and other regulators sent letters to banks, increasing scrutiny on their relationships with these businesses. Critics argued this was extralegal pressure, as the government was coercing banks to deny services to legal businesses without proving any wrongdoing, effectively "choking off" their access to the financial system [3, 4].

### 3. Pressure on Social Media and Content Moderation
In recent years, a significant area of extralegal pressure involves government officials contacting social media companies to encourage the removal or suppression of content they deem harmful, such as misinformation or foreign propaganda.

*   ***Murthy v. Missouri* (Formerly *Missouri v. Biden*):** This ongoing Supreme Court case examines allegations that officials from the White House, the FBI, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) unlawfully coerced social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and X (formerly Twitter) to remove or down-rank posts related to COVID-19 and election integrity. The plaintiffs argue that the government's persistent communications, veiled threats of regulatory action (like amending Section 230), and public criticism crossed the line from persuasion into unconstitutional coercion that violated users' First Amendment rights [5, 6]. The government contends it was merely working to counter dangerous misinformation in a responsible way.

### 4. National Security and Technology Sector Demands
The government often uses national security arguments to pressure technology companies for access to data or to alter their products. While some requests are made through legal channels like warrants, others represent a gray area of pressure.

*   **FBI vs. Apple (2016):** After the San Bernardino terrorist attack, the FBI publicly demanded that Apple create a new version of its operating system (a "backdoor") to bypass the security features on an attacker's iPhone. Apple CEO Tim Cook refused in a public letter, arguing that creating such a tool would compromise the security of all iPhone users. The DOJ pursued a court order, but the case highlighted the intense public and private pressure the government placed on Apple to comply, framing the issue as a matter of national security versus corporate interest [7]. The FBI ultimately dropped the case after finding a third party to unlock the phone, but the debate over encryption and government access continues.

*   **Pressure on TikTok:** The U.S. government has exerted immense pressure on ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok, to divest its U.S. operations, citing national security risks related to data privacy and potential influence by the Chinese Communist Party. This pressure has included executive orders, threats of a nationwide ban, and public campaigns by officials, culminating in legislation passed in 2024 that forces a sale or a ban. While a law was ultimately passed, years of extralegal threats preceded it, shaping the corporate and public landscape [8].

### 5. Conditional Financial Bailouts and Assistance
During times of economic crisis, the government can attach powerful, informal conditions to financial aid that go beyond the letter of the law.

*   **The 2008 Financial Crisis (TARP):** During the 2008 financial crisis, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson convened the CEOs of the nine largest U.S. banks and pressured them to accept capital injections from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Some bank leaders were reportedly reluctant, believing their institutions were stable and that accepting the funds would signal weakness. However, Paulson made it clear that participation was not truly optional, arguing it was necessary for the stability of the entire financial system. The banks ultimately agreed, demonstrating how the government can use its role as a lender of last resort to compel action from an entire industry [9].

### Understanding Extralegal Pressure

Extralegal pressure refers to actions by government entities that influence corporate behavior through informal means, such as threats, persuasion, or indirect incentives, rather than through formal legal processes like legislation, regulations, or court orders. These tactics can blur the line between legitimate government advocacy and coercive overreach, potentially raising concerns about due process, free speech, and regulatory fairness [1]. While such pressures are not inherently illegal, they can be controversial when they circumvent established legal channels. Below, I outline several notable examples from U.S. history, drawing on documented cases involving various administrations and agencies. These examples span financial services, technology, environmental policy, and public health.

### Examples of Extralegal Pressure

1. **Operation Choke Point (2013‚Äì2017)**: Initiated by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) under the Obama administration, this program aimed to combat fraud by pressuring banks to terminate relationships with certain "high-risk" industries, such as payday lenders, firearms dealers, and tobacco sellers. Instead of pursuing formal regulations or prosecutions, regulators used informal guidance, subpoenas, and reputational threats to encourage banks to "de-risk" these clients, effectively cutting off their access to financial services. Critics argued this constituted extralegal pressure, as it lacked statutory authority and targeted legal businesses without due process [1][2]. The program was discontinued in 2017 amid congressional scrutiny, but similar tactics have been alleged in other sectors.

2. **Jawboning Social Media Companies for Content Moderation (2020‚ÄìPresent)**: The Biden administration has faced accusations of using extralegal pressure on tech giants like Meta (Facebook), Twitter (now X), and Google to censor or suppress content related to COVID-19 misinformation, election integrity, and other topics. This "jawboning"‚Äîinformal persuasion or threats‚Äîallegedly involved White House officials emailing or meeting with executives to demand content removals, with implied threats of antitrust actions or regulatory scrutiny if companies did not comply. The Supreme Court case *Murthy v. Missouri* (formerly *Missouri v. Biden*) highlighted emails where officials urged platforms to "do more" against misinformation, raising First Amendment concerns. While the Court ruled in 2024 that plaintiffs lacked standing, it did not dismiss the underlying jawboning claims [3][4]. Similar pressures occurred under previous administrations, such as the Trump-era requests to social media firms regarding election-related content.

3. **Environmental and Climate-Related Pressures on Energy Companies (Various Eras)**: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other agencies have used informal tactics to push corporations toward greener practices without formal rulemaking. For instance, during the Obama administration, the EPA's "Sue and Settle" strategy involved colluding with environmental groups to enter consent decrees that imposed new standards on industries like coal and oil, bypassing public comment periods [5]. More recently, the Biden administration has encouraged financial institutions to adopt climate risk assessments through non-binding guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with critics claiming this creates de facto mandates via regulatory threats [6]. These actions influence corporate investment decisions, such as divesting from fossil fuels, without explicit legal requirements.

4. **Antitrust Threats to Influence Tech and Media Behavior (2010s‚ÄìPresent)**: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and DOJ have allegedly used the specter of antitrust investigations to extract concessions from corporations. For example, during the Trump administration, reports emerged of White House pressure on the DOJ to scrutinize mergers like AT&T-Time Warner, partly to punish CNN (a Time Warner subsidiary) for perceived anti-Trump coverage [7]. Similarly, the Biden FTC, under Chair Lina Khan, has been accused of using informal warnings and prolonged reviews to deter mergers or force policy changes in Big Tech, such as data privacy practices at companies like Amazon and Google, without always filing formal charges [8]. This form of pressure leverages the uncertainty and costs of investigations to influence corporate strategy.

5. **Public Health Mandates During the COVID-19 Pandemic (2020‚Äì2022)**: The Biden administration employed extralegal tactics to encourage private employers to implement vaccine mandates. While the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) attempted a formal rule (later struck down by the Supreme Court), President Biden publicly urged corporations to "step up" and mandate vaccines, with implied threats of federal contract losses or regulatory scrutiny for non-compliance [9]. Companies like United Airlines and Tyson Foods adopted mandates following these calls, and emails revealed coordination between the White House and business leaders. Critics viewed this as coercive jawboning, especially since it targeted private entities without legislative backing [4].

These examples illustrate how extralegal pressures can achieve policy goals efficiently but often spark debates over government overreach. They are not exhaustive, and similar tactics have been used in areas like national security (e.g., pressuring telecoms for surveillance cooperation post-9/11) [10]. Legal challenges, such as those in *Murthy v. Missouri*, continue to test the boundaries of such actions.
