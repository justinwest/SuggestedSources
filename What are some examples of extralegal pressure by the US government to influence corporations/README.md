# ü§ñ Claude's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

The US government has employed various forms of extralegal pressure to influence corporate behavior, using regulatory agencies, informal communications, and economic leverage to achieve policy goals without formal legal mandates. These tactics, sometimes called "jawboning" or "moral suasion," operate in gray areas between formal regulation and private sector autonomy.

## Operation Choke Point and Financial Services

One of the most documented examples is Operation Choke Point, a Department of Justice initiative that pressured banks to terminate relationships with legal businesses deemed "high-risk." [1][2] The program targeted industries including payday lenders, firearms dealers, and other businesses by encouraging financial institutions to close their accounts or deny services. Banks were warned that serving these industries could result in increased regulatory scrutiny, effectively forcing many legal businesses out of the banking system. [1]

A similar pattern has emerged in cryptocurrency regulation, with claims of "Operation Choke Point 2.0" where crypto companies report difficulty accessing banking services following informal government pressure on financial institutions. [3] The FDIC has faced scrutiny for letters that allegedly discouraged banks from providing services to crypto-related businesses without explicit regulatory prohibitions. [3]

## Social Media Content Moderation

Government pressure on social media platforms represents another significant area of extralegal influence. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that the Biden administration pressured the company to censor COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, with officials expressing frustration when Meta didn't comply with their requests. [4] 

The Twitter Files disclosures and subsequent litigation revealed extensive government communications with social media companies regarding content moderation decisions. [5] A federal judge found this pressure so concerning that they issued an injunction restricting White House communications with social media companies, though this was later modified by higher courts. [5] These cases illustrate how government agencies used informal pressure rather than formal regulations to influence platform policies.

## Defense Contracting and Labor Relations

The defense industry has experienced notable government pressure regarding employment decisions. In 2012, the Obama administration asked Lockheed Martin and other defense contractors to delay issuing layoff notices that would have been required under the WARN Act, effectively asking companies to potentially violate federal labor law to avoid pre-election political consequences. [6][7] The administration reportedly assured contractors that any legal costs from failing to provide required notices would be covered by the government.

## Tax Administration as Pressure Tool

The IRS targeting controversy demonstrated how tax administration can become a tool of extralegal pressure. [8] Conservative and Tea Party groups faced prolonged delays and intensive scrutiny in their applications for tax-exempt status, with investigations revealing that these groups were systematically targeted based on their political orientation rather than neutral criteria.

## Presidential Influence on Corporate Decisions

Individual presidents have used their platforms to pressure specific companies on business decisions. Donald Trump's intervention to prevent Carrier from moving jobs to Mexico exemplified direct presidential pressure on corporate operations, using a combination of public attention, potential policy changes, and negotiated incentives. [9] Such interventions demonstrate how high-profile government attention can influence corporate decision-making even without formal regulatory action.

## Legal and Constitutional Concerns

The Supreme Court case National Rifle Association of America v. Vullo established important precedents regarding the limits of government pressure on private entities. [10] The case addressed when informal government pressure becomes unconstitutional coercion, particularly regarding First Amendment rights and the boundaries between legitimate regulation and improper government influence.

These examples illustrate how government agencies and officials use regulatory uncertainty, public pressure, and informal communications to influence corporate behavior without formal legal mandates. While such techniques can be effective policy tools, they raise significant questions about due process, regulatory transparency, and the appropriate limits of government power in a market economy.

# ü§ñ ChatGPT's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

**Examples of extralegal pressure by the U.S. government on corporations include:**

1. **Operation Choke Point (2013‚Äì2017):** The U.S. Department of Justice secretly launched *Operation Choke Point* to ‚Äúchoke off‚Äù certain legal businesses from banking services without new laws or formal regulations. Banks were leaned on to terminate relationships with lawful but ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù industries (e.g. payday lenders, firearms dealers) by warning that serving them posed *reputational risk* that could trigger federal investigations [1]. In effect, regulators‚Äô informal guidance became an **implicit threat** ‚Äì banks were told (behind the scenes) that continuing to bank these companies might invite tougher scrutiny. As a result, many banks abruptly shut down accounts of businesses that had broken no law, effectively pressuring those companies to quit those lines of business or be **de-banked** [2]. This extralegal program drew heavy criticism and was ultimately shut down; the FDIC even settled lawsuits by agreeing to stop issuing ‚Äúinformal‚Äù unwritten suggestions to banks about which legal customers to avoid, an admission that the earlier pressure had overstepped proper authority [1].

2. **WikiLeaks Financial Blockade (2010):** After WikiLeaks published classified U.S. government cables, American officials (formally and informally) pressured private firms to cut off the site‚Äôs access to infrastructure and funds. For example, Senator Joe Lieberman publicly urged companies to stop servicing WikiLeaks ‚Äì and indeed, Amazon abruptly **removed WikiLeaks from its web servers** following government criticism, and payment processors like Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal **suspended WikiLeaks‚Äô accounts** even though no court had ordered them to do so [3]. This **financial blockade** severely disrupted WikiLeaks‚Äô operations by choking off donations and web hosting. Observers noted that these corporations appeared to be acting ‚Äúin response to a public request‚Äù from officials and out of fear of being seen as aiding an enemy of the state, rather than due to any legal requirement [3]. In other words, U.S. authorities used public pressure and behind-the-scenes warnings to induce companies to do what the government could not directly mandate ‚Äì effectively censoring WikiLeaks by *extralegal means*.

3. **Pressure on Social Media to Censor Content (2020‚Äì2023):** There have been multiple instances of government officials pushing social media platforms to remove or suppress certain content outside any legal process. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic the Biden White House and other officials **repeatedly urged** Facebook/Meta to *remove posts* they deemed ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù about COVID ‚Äì even including humorous or satirical content ‚Äì despite such speech being legally protected [4]. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg later revealed that his company felt ‚Äúpressured‚Äù by senior administration officials to censor certain COVID-19 discussions, and he expressed regret for complying with some of those takedown requests, calling the government pressure ‚Äúwrong‚Äù [4]. In a related vein, internal files from Twitter (the ‚ÄúTwitter Files‚Äù released in 2022) showed that agencies like the FBI regularly **flagged tweets and accounts** to Twitter for moderation, and one Twitter executive described the close cooperation as *‚Äúgovernment‚Äìindustry sync‚Äù* due to the constant contact [8]. This unofficial coordination led to Twitter sometimes suppressing content (e.g. posts about elections or the Hunter Biden laptop story) at the behest of government actors, raising concerns that authorities were skirting First Amendment limits by using private platforms as proxies. In mid-2023, a federal judge responded to evidence of such contacts by **barring** certain Biden administration agencies and officials from communicating with social-media companies about moderating protected speech. The judge found that the government had likely ‚Äúgone too far‚Äù in pressing platforms to delete or downgrade content, and the injunction aimed to stop officials from encouraging censorship of *‚Äúdissenting views‚Äù* under the guise of combating misinformation [5].

4. **‚ÄúOperation Choke Point 2.0‚Äù (Crypto Industry, 2022‚Äì2023):** More recently, figures in the cryptocurrency industry have accused U.S. regulators of running an *unofficial crackdown* to isolate crypto businesses from the banking system ‚Äì a campaign they‚Äôve dubbed **Operation Choke Point 2.0**. While not formally acknowledged by government, evidence has emerged that regulators quietly **pressured banks to distance themselves from crypto clients**. In 2022, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) privately asked nearly two dozen banks to **‚Äúpause‚Äù or limit their crypto-related activities**, according to letters later obtained via FOIA requests [6]. This informal guidance (issued after high-profile crypto collapses) effectively discouraged banks from doing business with legitimate crypto exchanges and firms, without any law or new rule stating they must do so. Crypto advocates argue that the coordinated timing ‚Äì including the sudden closures or debanking of major crypto-friendly banks ‚Äì indicates a *de facto* policy to strangle the crypto sector‚Äôs access to finance, much like the original Operation Choke Point targeted other industries [6]. Regulators deny any unlawful targeting, but the practice of quietly warning banks off entire lawful sectors (rather than case-by-case enforcement) is seen as extralegal pressure, since it leverages supervisory power to achieve policy aims not enacted by Congress.

5. **IRS Targeting Controversy (2010‚Äì2013):** Another example often cited as extralegal pressure was the IRS‚Äôs treatment of certain non-profit organizations based on their political leanings. An internal audit in 2013 revealed that IRS officials had singled out applications from conservative-leaning groups (especially those with names like ‚ÄúTea Party‚Äù or ‚ÄúPatriots‚Äù) for **extra scrutiny and delays** when they applied for tax-exempt status [7]. This **selective targeting** was not mandated by any law or policy ‚Äì in fact, it violated standard, neutral procedure ‚Äì and appeared to be driven by political bias inside the agency. Dozens of conservative groups experienced long delays or intrusive questions, effectively impeding their activities during the 2012 election cycle. When this practice came to light, it caused a scandal: the IRS apologized, and investigations confirmed that inappropriate criteria had been used to flag groups (primarily on the right, though some left-leaning names were flagged too) [7]. Critics characterized this as extralegal harassment by government officials ‚Äì using the IRS‚Äôs vast discretionary power to **burden or intimidate certain organizations** without any legal justification, thereby influencing which voices in civil society could operate freely.

Republican-led states alleged the White House and agencies essentially **coerced platforms** to suppress certain viewpoints (beyond any legal remit).

# ü§ñ Gemini's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

Extralegal pressure by the U.S. government refers to actions where officials use their influence, authority, or the perceived power of their office to influence corporate behavior without passing a specific law or initiating a formal legal process. This can range from public persuasion, known as "jawboning" [15], to more coercive, behind-the-scenes efforts to "nudge" or compel companies to act in a certain way [16]. Examples span various administrations and target diverse industries, from banking and finance to social media and manufacturing.

Here are some prominent examples of extralegal pressure by the U.S. government on corporations:

### 1. Pressure on Banks and Financial Institutions

The government has used its regulatory influence over the financial sector to discourage banks from serving industries that are legal but politically disfavored.

*   **Operation Choke Point:** This was a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) initiative under the Obama administration, publicly announced in 2013. The program officially targeted illegal or fraudulent businesses but was accused of pressuring banks to terminate relationships with a wide range of legal businesses, including payday lenders, firearm dealers, and ammunition sellers [1, 9]. A 2014 House Oversight Committee report concluded that the DOJ and regulators were "exerting informal, behind-the-scenes pressure" to "choke off" these businesses' access to banking services, effectively forcing them out of business without having to prove they had broken any laws [7].
*   **"Operation Choke Point 2.0":** In the 2020s, critics have used this term to describe what they see as a coordinated effort by financial regulators under the Biden administration to discourage banks from providing services to cryptocurrency companies [2, 6]. While regulators state they are providing guidance on managing the high risks associated with the crypto sector, industry participants claim this amounts to a "shadow ban" or "de-banking" campaign, where banks feel pressured to drop crypto clients to avoid heightened regulatory scrutiny [2, 6].
*   **Pressure Following WikiLeaks Disclosures:** In 2010, after WikiLeaks published a trove of sensitive U.S. diplomatic cables, government officials publicly pressured financial service companies to cut ties with the organization. Following comments from officials, including Senator Joe Lieberman, companies like Amazon, PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard suspended services for WikiLeaks, significantly hampering its ability to receive donations [3].
*   **Pressure on Institutions Serving the NRA:** In *National Rifle Association of America v. Vullo* (2024), the Supreme Court reviewed allegations that a New York state official, Maria Vullo, used her regulatory power to coerce banks and insurance companies into severing ties with the NRA after the Parkland school shooting. The NRA argued this was unconstitutional pressure designed to suppress its First Amendment rights. The Court ruled that a government official cannot use their power to coerce private parties to suppress disfavored speech, strengthening protections against this form of extralegal pressure [17].

### 2. Pressure on Social Media Companies for Content Moderation

Both Republican and Democratic administrations have been accused of pressuring social media companies to align their content moderation policies with government preferences.

*   **COVID-19 and Election Content:** A federal judge in 2023 issued an injunction restricting Biden administration officials from communicating with social media companies about moderating protected free speech [5]. The ruling cited extensive evidence of officials "significantly encouraging, and at times coercing" platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter (now X) to remove or suppress content, particularly related to COVID-19 policies and the 2020 election [5]. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg later testified that the Biden administration had been "very direct" in its pressure on Facebook to censor certain COVID-19 content [4].
*   **The "Twitter Files":** Internal documents from Twitter released in 2022 revealed frequent and routine communication between company executives and government agencies, including the FBI, DHS, and the White House [10]. These communications included requests to review and sometimes remove specific content and accounts, raising concerns about government influence over content moderation decisions on the platform [10].

### 3. Presidential "Jawboning" on Business Operations

Presidents have often used their public platform and the threat of government action to influence corporate decisions regarding jobs, investments, and pricing.

*   **Carrier Plant in Indiana:** In 2016, President-elect Donald Trump publicly pressured the air-conditioner manufacturer Carrier and its parent company, United Technologies, to reverse a decision to move a plant from Indiana to Mexico. Citing the leverage of United Technologies' significant federal defense contracts, Trump successfully negotiated a deal to keep a portion of the jobs in the state [12].
*   **General Motors Plant Closures:** President Trump also publicly attacked General Motors in 2018 for its decision to close plants in the U.S., threatening to cut federal subsidies to the company [13].
*   **Defense Contractor Layoff Notices:** In 2012, the Obama administration asked defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin, to delay issuing legally required mass layoff notices ahead of the presidential election [11]. The potential layoffs were triggered by impending automatic budget cuts (sequestration). The White House argued the notices were premature and offered to cover the companies' legal liability if they were sued for failing to provide the required 60-day notice [11, 14].

### 4. Targeted Scrutiny by Government Agencies

Government agencies have been accused of using their regulatory and enforcement powers to apply disproportionate pressure on certain groups or organizations.

*   **IRS Targeting Controversy:** Beginning in 2013, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was found to have subjected conservative and Tea Party-affiliated political groups to heightened scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status [8]. These groups faced extensive delays and unusually detailed, burdensome requests for information, which critics argued was an abuse of the IRS's power to create a chilling effect on political activity [8].

# ü§ñ Grok's Answer (Using Suggested Sources)

Extralegal pressure by the US government refers to informal or indirect methods used by federal or state officials to influence corporate behavior without relying on explicit laws, court orders, or formal regulations. This can include threats of regulatory scrutiny, moral suasion (also known as "jawboning"), nudge tactics, or leveraging government relationships to encourage compliance. Such practices often raise concerns about overreach, free speech, and due process, as highlighted in various court cases and investigations. Below, I outline prominent examples drawn from historical and recent cases, categorized for clarity. These are based on the provided sources, supplemented where necessary for completeness and accuracy with additional reputable references (e.g., court documents or official reports).

### 1. Financial Sector: Operation Choke Point and Related Programs
Operation Choke Point was a Department of Justice (DOJ) initiative launched in 2013 under the Obama administration, aimed at combating fraud by pressuring banks to sever ties with businesses deemed "high-risk," such as payday lenders, firearms dealers, and tobacco sellers. Regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), used informal guidance and threats of heightened scrutiny to encourage banks to close accounts, even for legally operating companies. This was criticized as an extralegal means to "choke off" financial access without formal charges [7][9]. For instance, banks were reportedly told to "quit the business or we'll close your account" when dealing with payday lenders [1].

A similar pattern emerged in what critics call "Operation Choke Point 2.0," targeting cryptocurrency firms. In 2023, the FDIC allegedly sent letters to banks discouraging crypto-related activities, leading to account closures and restricted services. Coinbase and others claimed this was informal pressure to limit the industry's growth without new legislation [2][6]. The House Oversight Committee investigated these actions, finding evidence of secret DOJ pressure on banks to cut ties with legal businesses [7].

### 2. Social Media and Content Moderation
The US government has repeatedly used informal communications to pressure social media companies to censor or moderate content. In 2021, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that the Biden administration urged the company to suppress COVID-19-related posts, including humor and satire, which Meta resisted but felt compelled to address due to implied regulatory threats [4]. This was part of broader allegations in the Twitter Files, a series of internal documents released in 2022 showing FBI and other agencies pressuring Twitter (now X) to remove or shadow-ban content related to elections, Hunter Biden, and misinformation, often without legal warrants [10].

A federal judge in 2023 ruled that such communications from the White House and agencies like the FBI violated the First Amendment, restricting future interactions with platforms like Facebook and Twitter on content moderation [5]. These cases illustrate "jawboning," where officials use persuasion or veiled threats to influence private companies [15].

### 3. Political and Nonprofit Targeting
The IRS targeting controversy (2010‚Äì2013) involved the Internal Revenue Service applying extra scrutiny to conservative groups, such as Tea Party organizations, seeking tax-exempt status. Applications were delayed or denied based on political keywords, which a 2013 Treasury Inspector General report deemed inappropriate and extralegal, as it bypassed standard procedures [8]. This was seen as indirect pressure to hinder political activities without formal legal action.

In a state-level example, the Supreme Court case *National Rifle Association of America v. Vullo* (2024) addressed New York financial regulator Maria Vullo's 2018 guidance letters urging insurers and banks to sever ties with the NRA due to its gun advocacy. The Court ruled this constituted unconstitutional coercion, as it used regulatory authority to pressure companies informally [17].

### 4. Defense and Manufacturing Sector: Job Retention and Layoff Notices
During the 2012 presidential election, the Obama administration requested that defense contractor Lockheed Martin delay issuing layoff notices required under the WARN Act, amid sequestration budget cuts. The White House offered to cover potential legal costs, a move critics called extralegal interference to avoid negative preelection publicity [11][14]. Similarly, in 2011, the administration pressured Boeing to relocate a plant from South Carolina to union-friendly Washington state, though this involved NLRB actions that were later dropped [18, additional source for context on labor disputes].

Under the Trump administration, President Trump personally pressured Carrier (a United Technologies subsidiary) in 2016 to keep manufacturing jobs in Indiana instead of moving them to Mexico. Using public tweets, calls, and incentives like tax breaks, Trump influenced the company to retain some jobs, exemplifying moral suasion [12][15]. In 2018, Trump similarly jawboned General Motors over plant closures, threatening subsidy cuts and tariffs, leading to partial reversals [13].

### 5. Other Notable Cases: WikiLeaks and Broader Nudge Tactics
In 2010, following WikiLeaks' release of classified documents, the US government informally pressured financial companies like Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal to block donations to the organization. Without formal legal orders, these companies complied, effectively cutting off WikiLeaks' funding and highlighting the limits of internet free speech [3].

More broadly, nudge theory has been employed by administrations to influence corporate behavior subtly. For example, the Obama-era "nudge unit" encouraged energy companies to adopt green practices through informal incentives rather than mandates [16]. While often benign, critics argue it can blur into coercive pressure when tied to regulatory favors.

These examples demonstrate a pattern across administrations, often justified as protecting consumers or national security but criticized for circumventing legal processes. Legal challenges, such as those in *Missouri v. Biden* (related to social media pressure) [19, additional source for ongoing litigation], continue to test the boundaries of such tactics.

# ü§ñ Claude's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

The US government has employed various forms of extralegal pressure to influence corporate behavior, operating in gray areas between formal regulation and voluntary compliance. These tactics leverage government power without relying on explicit legal mandates or court orders.

## Regulatory Agency Pressure

Federal agencies frequently use informal pressure tactics to achieve policy goals. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has used "regulation by enforcement" and public statements to influence corporate disclosure practices beyond what securities laws strictly require [1]. Similarly, the Federal Trade Commission has employed consent decrees and public pressure campaigns to shape business practices in areas where formal regulatory authority may be limited [2].

The Environmental Protection Agency has used public shaming campaigns and threat of future regulation to encourage voluntary environmental compliance. Companies often agree to environmental remediation or emissions reductions that exceed legal requirements to avoid negative publicity or potential future litigation [3].

## Financial Sector Pressure

Banking regulators have extensively used informal pressure, particularly following the 2008 financial crisis. The Federal Reserve and other banking agencies employed "supervisory guidance" that, while technically non-binding, carried significant weight with banks due to regulators' examination and enforcement powers [4]. Banks frequently treated this guidance as mandatory to maintain good relationships with their regulators.

Operation Choke Point, conducted by the Department of Justice and banking regulators from 2013-2017, pressured banks to terminate relationships with legal businesses deemed "high-risk," including payday lenders and gun retailers, without formal legal proceedings [5].

## Technology and Social Media

Government officials have increasingly used public statements and private communications to pressure technology companies regarding content moderation. The Biden administration has publicly called on social media platforms to remove COVID-19 "misinformation," while congressional hearings have featured implicit threats of regulation if companies don't voluntarily adopt preferred policies [6].

The Federal Trade Commission has used broad interpretations of consumer protection authority to investigate and pressure technology companies regarding data privacy practices, often securing voluntary commitments that exceed current legal requirements [7].

## Defense and National Security

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) wields significant informal influence over corporate mergers and acquisitions involving foreign entities. Companies often voluntarily restructure or abandon deals based on informal signals about likely CFIUS opposition, avoiding formal review processes [8].

Defense contractors face pressure to adopt specific labor, environmental, and social policies through government contracting requirements and informal guidance, leveraging the government's position as a major purchaser [9].

## Tax and Trade Policy

The Internal Revenue Service has used public statements and selective enforcement to discourage certain tax strategies that may be technically legal but viewed as inappropriate. The "name and shame" approach includes publishing lists of abusive tax shelters and promoters [10].

Trade agencies have used threats of tariffs, investigations, and public criticism to pressure companies to change sourcing practices or pricing strategies, particularly regarding imports from specific countries [11].

## Congressional Pressure

Congressional committees regularly use hearings, public statements, and private communications to pressure corporations. This includes threats of legislation, investigation, or adverse publicity to encourage voluntary corporate policy changes. The pharmaceutical industry has faced repeated congressional pressure regarding drug pricing, leading to voluntary price rollbacks and policy changes [12].

# ü§ñ ChatGPT's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

Extralegal pressure refers to government officials using informal or coercive tactics ‚Äì outside the normal legal or legislative process ‚Äì to sway corporate behavior. Over the years, U.S. administrations have at times influenced companies through such means. Here are a few notable examples:

**1. Operation Choke Point (2013-2017):** This was an Obama-era Department of Justice (DOJ) initiative that leveraged bank regulators to cut off banking services for certain industries the administration deemed undesirable (even though those businesses were lawful) ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20Operation%20Choke%20Point%20was,every%20business%20needs%20to%20survive)). Under Operation Choke Point, regulators labeled various legal sectors ‚Äì from payday lenders and gun retailers to coin dealers ‚Äì as ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù and warned banks of **‚Äúreputational risk‚Äù**, implicitly threatening federal investigations if they didn‚Äôt drop those clients ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=merchants%20creates%20a%20%E2%80%9Creputational%20risk%E2%80%9D,threat%20of%20a%20federal%20investigation)) ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20The%20Department%20lacks%20adequate,expanded%20its%20Section%20951%20authority)). Internal memos showed officials knew the policy was forcing banks to exit entire lines of legal business ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20The%20Department%20is%20aware,%E2%80%9Chigh%20risk%E2%80%9D%20by%20the%20government)). Critics argue this was **extralegal coercion**: rather than outlawing these industries through legislation, agencies informally **intimidated banks** into denying services, effectively choking off the targeted businesses‚Äô access to finance ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20Operation%20Choke%20Point%20was,every%20business%20needs%20to%20survive)) ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnberlau/2018/10/31/choke-point-is-frightening-precedent-for-bank-regulatory-abuse/#:~:text=Yet%20after%20reading%20through%20new,access%20to%20the%20banking%20system)). A House Oversight report concluded DOJ **‚Äúlacked adequate legal authority‚Äù** for this program and had stretched its statutory powers beyond their limits ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20The%20Department%20lacks%20adequate,expanded%20its%20Section%20951%20authority)). Operation Choke Point was eventually wound down amid backlash, with observers calling it a ‚Äúfrightening‚Äù precedent for regulatory abuse via informal pressure ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnberlau/2018/10/31/choke-point-is-frightening-precedent-for-bank-regulatory-abuse/#:~:text=Yet%20after%20reading%20through%20new,access%20to%20the%20banking%20system)).

**2. Government ‚ÄúJawboning‚Äù of Tech Platforms:** U.S. officials have often applied extralegal pressure on social media and tech companies to moderate content. **‚ÄúJawboning‚Äù** is the term for when authorities use their influence ‚Äì not laws ‚Äì to push private platforms to take down or restrict certain speech ([www.lawfaremedia.org](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/informal-government-coercion-and-problem-jawboning#:~:text=For%20years%20now%2C%20scholars%20have,the%20social%20media%20companies%20do)). For example, members of Congress and executive agencies have **urged or warned social media companies** to remove content deemed misinformation, hate speech, or otherwise harmful, under implied threats of regulation or legal action ([www.lawfaremedia.org](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/informal-government-coercion-and-problem-jawboning#:~:text=For%20years%20now%2C%20scholars%20have,the%20social%20media%20companies%20do)) ([www.eff.org](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/06/when-jawboning-creates-private-liability?language=ar#:~:text=Among%20the%20state%20actor%20theories,they%20act%20according%20to%20it)). In 2021, the Biden administration‚Äôs Surgeon General and White House officials publicly **pressured Facebook** to speed up removal of COVID-19 vaccine falsehoods, even flagging specific ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù posts and accounts for the platform to act on ([www.lawfaremedia.org](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/informal-government-coercion-and-problem-jawboning#:~:text=The%20second%20jawboning,the%20First%20Amendment%20rights%20of)).

A notable case, *Missouri v.

A lower court initially found that officials likely went beyond mere persuasion and **‚Äúsignificantly encouraged‚Äù** private censorship, issuing an injunction to halt certain contacts ([www.lawfaremedia.org](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/it-depends-who-s-doing-the-jawboning#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20on%20March,federal%20government%20asserts%20that%20the)). (That order was later put on hold, and the Supreme Court ultimately set aside the case on procedural grounds, but the controversy underscored the blurry line between advice and pressure ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-wont-curb-biden-administration-social-media-contacts-2024-06-26/#:~:text=The%20U,allows%20the%20administration%20to%20continue)).) Similarly, during previous administrations, lawmakers threatened to weaken tech companies‚Äô legal protections (like Section 230 immunity) or pursue antitrust actions if platforms didn‚Äôt address content issues to their satisfaction. This kind of *arms-length influence* ‚Äì using political clout and public shaming rather than statutes ‚Äì exemplifies extralegal pressure on corporations to change policies. Digital rights advocates warn that such **informal government intervention** in content moderation, even if well-intentioned, can become ‚Äú**a system of informal censorship**‚Äù incompatible with free-speech norms ([www.eff.org](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/06/when-jawboning-creates-private-liability?language=ar#:~:text=suits%20against%20government%20agencies%20and,processing%20payments%20to%20the%20website)).

**3. Presidential Bullying and Retaliation:** U.S. presidents have at times directly pressured companies through extralegal means, often via the ‚Äúbully pulpit‚Äù or behind-the-scenes leverage. A classic example is **President John F. Kennedy‚Äôs clash with U.S. Steel in 1962**. After the steel industry announced a sudden price hike that JFK felt would damage the economy, he reacted with public fury and private threats. Kennedy lambasted the move as a ‚Äúwholly unjustifiable‚Ä¶defiance of the public interest,‚Äù and his administration hinted at reprisals, including antitrust scrutiny and shifting government steel orders to competitors ([www.peoplesworld.org](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/how-jfk-forced-steel-price-roll-back/#:~:text=was%20biting%20%E2%80%93%20but%20he,even%20more%20caustic%20in%20private)) ([time.com](https://time.com/archive/6627918/steel-the-price-fixing-verdict/#:~:text=Since%20John%20F,a%20big%2C%20if%20qualified%2C%20victory)). Under this intense pressure, the major steel companies backed down and rolled back the price increase ‚Äì a victory achieved not by any new law, but by presidential **jawboning and the implicit threat of government action** ([time.com](https://time.com/archive/6627918/steel-the-price-fixing-verdict/#:~:text=Since%20John%20F,a%20big%2C%20if%20qualified%2C%20victory)). Another example is **President Richard Nixon‚Äôs attempts to retaliate against media corporations** critical of him. Angered by *The Washington Post*‚Äôs Watergate reporting, Nixon‚Äôs allies secretly tried to **challenge the broadcast licenses** of television stations owned by the Post‚Äôs parent company in 1973 ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/#:~:text=But%20here%27s%20the%20thing%3A%20That,were%20The%20Washington%20Post%20Co)). While the White House denied orchestrating it, the timing and connections made it clear this was a form of presidential harassment ‚Äì using regulatory processes and proxies to punish a company for its journalism ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/#:~:text=In%201973%2C%20the%20Associated%20Press,Watergate%20investigation%20of%20the%20president)) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/#:~:text=Nixon%27s%20press%20secretary%2C%20Ronald%20Ziegler%2C,%E2%80%9CNo%2C%20absolutely%20not%2C%E2%80%9D%20Ziegler%20assured)). Fast forward to recent years, **President Donald Trump** also repeatedly pressured or threatened companies without formal legal basis. He **mused about revoking NBC‚Äôs broadcast licenses** after negative coverage, and he attacked Amazon (owned by Post owner Jeff Bezos) with calls for higher postal rates and antitrust scrutiny, largely to pressure Bezos over *Washington Post* coverage ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2017/12/15/why-trump-cant-revoke-nbcs-broadcast-licenses-1513306121#:~:text=President%20Trump%20questioned%20the%20appropriateness,than%20implied%20by%20Trump%27s%20statements)). Trump‚Äôs 2017 tweets about limiting network licenses were widely condemned as ‚ÄúNixonian,‚Äù since they so closely paralleled Nixon‚Äôs tactics of using extralegal levers against unfriendly media ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/#:~:text=President%20Trump%20is%20yet%20again,to%20attempt%20in%20the%201970s)). In all these cases ‚Äì Kennedy with steel producers, Nixon/Trump with press outlets, and others ‚Äì the presidents sought to **influence corporate decisions through intimidation, public shaming, or implied regulatory retaliation rather than through duly enacted law** ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/#:~:text=President%20Trump%20is%20yet%20again,to%20attempt%20in%20the%201970s)) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/#:~:text=But%20here%27s%20the%20thing%3A%20That,were%20The%20Washington%20Post%20Co)).

Each of the above illustrates extralegal pressure: government actors stepping outside normal legislative or judicial channels to strong-arm corporations. Such pressure can be effective, but it is controversial because it evades accountability and tests the limits of the rule of law. Critics from across the political spectrum argue that when officials **‚Äúharass‚Äù or threaten private businesses into compliance without legal authority, it undermines transparency and the constitutional checks on government power ([oversight.house.gov](https://oversight.house.gov/report/report-dojs-operation-choke-point-secretly-pressured-banks-cut-ties-legal-business/#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20The%20Department%20lacks%20adequate,expanded%20its%20Section%20951%20authority)) ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnberlau/2018/10/31/choke-point-is-frightening-precedent-for-bank-regulatory-abuse/#:~:text=Yet%20after%20reading%20through%20new,access%20to%20the%20banking%20system)). On the other hand, some officials defend informal pressure as a quick way to serve the public interest (for instance, urging voluntary action on urgent problems when legislation is slow or absent) ([www.americanbar.org](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/administrative_law/resources/administrative-law-review/2023-spring/operation-choke-point-myths-reality/#:~:text=This%20Article%20is%20an%20attempt,Backlash%20erupted)) ([www.americanbar.org](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/administrative_law/resources/administrative-law-review/2023-spring/operation-choke-point-myths-reality/#:~:text=a%20benign%20initiative%20involving%20a,The%20gun%20industry)). The tension between those views continues in current debates ‚Äì for example, how far the government can go in leaning on tech firms to police content, or banks to drop certain clients, before it crosses the line into unlawful coercion. Ultimately, the recurring examples of extralegal influence ‚Äì from Operation Choke Point to jawboning Big Tech to presidential vendettas ‚Äì highlight the importance of clear legal boundaries on government action, even when dealing with powerful corporations.

# ü§ñ Gemini's Answer (Without Using Suggested Sources)

Extralegal pressure by the U.S. government refers to actions taken to influence corporate behavior that fall outside of formally enacted laws, regulations, or judicial orders. Instead of passing a new law or filing a lawsuit, government officials‚Äîfrom the President to agency heads‚Äîuse the immense power, influence, and authority of their positions to persuade, coerce, or "jawbone" companies into making certain decisions. This is often done to achieve policy goals more quickly than the legislative process would allow or to address issues not easily covered by existing law.

These methods are controversial because they can circumvent the principles of due process and the rule of law, creating an unpredictable environment for businesses and potentially amounting to an abuse of power. Below are several examples categorized by the type of pressure applied.

### 1. Public Shaming and "Jawboning"

This is perhaps the most common form of extralegal pressure, where officials use public statements, speeches, or social media to praise or condemn corporate actions, thereby leveraging public opinion to influence a company.

*   **Kennedy vs. Steel Companies (1962):** This is the classic historical example of "jawboning." When U.S. Steel announced a significant price increase, President John F. Kennedy publicly denounced the move as an irresponsible, "wholly unjustifiable and irresponsible defiance of the public interest." His administration coupled this public condemnation with private threats of antitrust investigations and shifting government contracts to other companies. Within days, U.S. Steel and other steel companies rescinded the price hikes [1].

*   **President Trump's Use of Twitter (2016-2021):** President Donald Trump frequently used his Twitter account to directly pressure individual companies. He publicly criticized companies like Ford for moving jobs to Mexico, Carrier for plans to close a U.S. factory, and Boeing over the cost of Air Force One. Conversely, he praised companies that announced investments in the U.S. This direct and often unpredictable pressure was intended to influence corporate decisions on manufacturing, outsourcing, and pricing [2].

*   **Biden Administration on Gas Prices (2022-2023):** Facing high inflation and gasoline prices, President Joe Biden and his administration publicly called on oil and gas companies to increase production and lower prices at the pump. The White House accused them of "profiteering" from the war in Ukraine and threatened a windfall profits tax if they did not act. This public pressure campaign was designed to compel energy firms to change their pricing and investment strategies without new legislation [3].

### 2. The Threat of Investigation or Adverse Regulation

Government agencies hold significant discretionary power to investigate companies or enact burdensome regulations. The mere suggestion that this power might be used can be enough to alter corporate behavior, even if no formal action is ever taken.

*   **Operation Choke Point (c. 2013-2017):** This initiative by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and bank regulators like the FDIC is a highly controversial example. The government's stated goal was to combat mass-market consumer fraud by cutting off fraudulent merchants' access to the banking system. However, critics allege the program went much further, using informal pressure on banks to terminate their relationships with entire categories of legal but politically disfavored businesses, such as payday lenders, firearms dealers, and ammunition sellers. The pressure came in the form of heightened regulatory scrutiny and suggestions that servicing these clients was a "reputational risk," effectively choking off their financial lifelines without proving any wrongdoing [4, 5].

*   **Antitrust Scrutiny of Big Tech:** For years, officials in both the executive branch and Congress have threatened major technology companies (like Google, Meta, Amazon, and Apple) with antitrust investigations and breakups. This constant threat has a chilling effect on corporate strategy, potentially influencing decisions on mergers, acquisitions, and new product launches. Companies may self-censor or abandon business plans to avoid provoking a full-scale, costly, and potentially business-ending confrontation with regulators like the DOJ or FTC [6].

### 3. Informal Requests and National Security Concerns

Particularly in the realms of national security and law enforcement, the government often makes informal requests for cooperation that carry the implicit weight of its authority.

*   **Government Pressure on Social Media Content Moderation:** Following the 2016 election and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. government officials from the FBI, CDC, and the White House allegedly maintained regular, informal channels of communication with social media companies like Twitter (now X) and Facebook (now Meta). The stated purpose was to flag foreign disinformation and public health misinformation. However, critics and internal company documents (popularized as the "Twitter Files") suggest this evolved into a pressure campaign to censor or de-amplify specific content, viewpoints, and accounts, including those of domestic critics and journalists. This dynamic led to the landmark lawsuit *Missouri v. Biden*, in which courts are examining whether this pressure crossed the line into unconstitutional government coercion that violated the First Amendment [7, 8].

*   **CFIUS and the TikTok Case:** The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has the formal power to review and block foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies on national security grounds. However, the *threat* of a negative CFIUS review is a powerful extralegal tool. With TikTok, the Trump and Biden administrations used the threat of an outright ban to pressure its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, into a forced sale or divestiture of its U.S. operations. This pressure exists outside of a specific law banning the app (which came later) and uses the broad discretion of national security authority to dictate corporate structure [9].

### 4. Leveraging Government Contracts and Financial Power

As the world's single largest customer, the U.S. government can use its procurement and financial power to influence corporate behavior.

*   **Encouraging ESG and Domestic Sourcing:** Administrations can signal that companies aligning with certain policy goals‚Äîsuch as environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards, diversity initiatives, or domestic manufacturing‚Äîwill be looked upon more favorably when competing for federal contracts. While formal procurement rules exist, there is significant discretion in how contracts are awarded. This subtle, informal guidance can push companies to adopt policies they otherwise might not, in hopes of securing lucrative government work [10].

His reporting alleges a deep and sustained level of interaction between government agencies, particularly the FBI, and Twitter's content moderation teams. Taibbi's view is that this relationship evolved from cooperation into a system of government-driven censorship of disfavored speech and narratives.

This news report covers the legal developments in *Missouri v. Biden*. It explains the core of the lawsuit: that government officials allegedly coerced social media platforms into censoring speech in violation of the First Amendment. The article summarizes the court's view that some of the government's conduct likely crossed a constitutional line from persuasion into coercion, highlighting the legal controversy over these informal requests.

This article reports on the actions of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) regarding TikTok. The authors describe how CFIUS used its authority to demand that ByteDance sell its stake in the app or face a potential ban. This illustrates how a powerful but often opaque government body can dictate major corporate restructuring under the broad mandate of national security.

Written by two former politicians, this opinion piece argues against the use of government power, including federal contracting, to enforce ESG policy goals. The authors express the view that using the "power of the purse" to pressure companies into adopting specific social or environmental policies is a form of extralegal coercion that politicizes business and amounts to a "blacklist" against non-compliant firms.

### Understanding Extralegal Pressure
Extralegal pressure refers to actions by government entities that influence corporate behavior without relying on formal legal mechanisms, such as statutes, regulations, or court orders. These can include informal threats, public shaming, selective enforcement, or leveraging regulatory oversight to encourage compliance. While such tactics may skirt the boundaries of legality, they are often criticized for undermining due process and the rule of law [1]. The US government has employed these methods across various administrations to advance policy goals, particularly in areas like finance, technology, and environmental policy. Below, I outline several notable examples, drawing from documented cases and analyses.

### Examples of Extralegal Pressure

1. **Operation Choke Point (2013-2017)**: Initiated by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), this program targeted banks providing services to industries deemed "high-risk," such as payday lenders, firearms dealers, and tobacco sellers. Although these businesses operated legally, regulators pressured banks through informal guidance, heightened scrutiny, and threats of enforcement actions to terminate relationships with them. This effectively "choked off" financial access without formal rulemaking or legislation. Critics argued it amounted to backdoor regulation, leading to congressional investigations and the program's eventual termination [2][3].

2. **Pressure on Social Media Platforms for Content Moderation (2020-2023)**: Officials from the Biden administration, including White House staff and agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reportedly exerted informal pressure on companies like Meta (Facebook), Twitter (now X), and Google to censor or suppress content related to COVID-19 misinformation, election integrity, and other topics. This involved emails, meetings, and threats of regulatory scrutiny or antitrust actions if platforms did not comply. The Twitter Files disclosures and lawsuits like *Missouri v. Biden* (later *Murthy v. Missouri*) highlighted these interactions, with courts ruling some constituted potential First Amendment violations by coercing private actors [4][5].

3. **Environmental and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) Initiatives**: The US government has used extralegal means to push corporations toward climate-friendly policies. For instance, under the Obama and Biden administrations, agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Labor issued informal guidance encouraging pension funds and investors to divest from fossil fuels or prioritize ESG factors, without binding rules. This included public statements and selective enforcement threats, influencing companies like ExxonMobil and major banks to alter investment strategies. Critics, including some Republican-led states, have challenged these as overreach, leading to lawsuits alleging unconstitutional pressure [6][7].

4. **Antitrust Threats Against Tech Giants**: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and DOJ have implicitly used the specter of antitrust investigations to influence corporate decisions. A prominent example is the pressure on Amazon and Google during the Trump and Biden eras, where officials publicly criticized practices and hinted at breakups or fines to encourage changes in areas like data privacy and market dominance. In 2019, reports emerged of White House meetings where tech executives were urged to adjust algorithms or content policies under threat of heightened scrutiny, blending extralegal persuasion with potential legal action [8][9].

5. **Financial Sector Pressure on Gun Control and Other Social Issues**: Following mass shootings, federal officials, including those from the Treasury Department and FDIC, have informally encouraged banks to restrict services to firearms manufacturers and sellers. For example, in 2018, amid public pressure, regulators issued guidance that led banks like Citigroup and Bank of America to voluntarily impose restrictions on gun-related transactions. This was seen as government-orchestrated without legislative backing, echoing tactics from Operation Choke Point and drawing criticism for politicizing finance [3][10].

These examples illustrate a pattern where government leverages its oversight authority to achieve outcomes that might face resistance through formal channels. While proponents argue such pressures serve public interest (e.g., reducing risks from certain industries), detractors view them as abuses of power that circumvent democratic processes [1][5].
