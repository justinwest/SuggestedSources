Extralegal pressure refers to actions taken by government officials to influence corporate behavior that fall outside of formal laws, regulations, or judicial proceedings. This type of influence relies on the government's immense power, public platform, and ability to create incentives or threats, compelling companies to act in ways they otherwise might not. This practice, often called "jawboning" or "moral suasion," has been used by administrations of both political parties for various economic, national security, and social objectives.

Examples of this pressure can be categorized by the government's goal:

### 1. Influencing Economic and Industrial Policy

The government often uses its platform to pressure companies on matters like pricing, employment, and investment. This is frequently done to manage inflation, protect American jobs, or advance a particular industrial strategy.

*   **The Kennedy Administration vs. U.S. Steel (1962):** In a classic example of jawboning, President John F. Kennedy publicly condemned U.S. Steel and other steel companies for raising their prices, which he argued was inflationary and against the public interest. He used the "bully pulpit" to denounce the executives' actions as irresponsible. Behind the scenes, the administration also threatened to shift government contracts to companies that did not raise prices and initiated antitrust investigations [1]. Within days, the steel companies rescinded the price increases.

*   **The Trump Administration and Carrier Corp. (2016):** President-elect Donald Trump publicly targeted Carrier's parent company, United Technologies, for its plans to move 2,000 jobs from Indiana to Mexico. He used Twitter and public statements to threaten the company with a "very expensive tax" on imported goods. While the final deal to keep some jobs in Indiana involved state-level tax incentives, the intense, direct, and public pressure from the incoming president was a key driver of the company's decision to reverse course on some of the planned layoffs [2, 3].

*   **The Biden Administration and Oil Companies (2022):** Facing high gasoline prices, President Joe Biden publicly called on oil and gas companies to increase production and lower prices at the pump. In letters to major oil executives, he accused them of profiting from the war in Ukraine and threatened to use "all reasonable and appropriate Federal Government tools" to increase output and consumer supply [4]. This included threatening a "windfall tax" on profits, creating a climate of potential punitive action if the companies did not respond to his public demands.

### 2. Advancing National Security and Law Enforcement

Government agencies, particularly in the intelligence and law enforcement communities, have a long history of pressuring companies to provide access to data, technology, or communications for national security purposes.

*   **The "Crypto Wars" (1990s-Present):** Beginning in the 1990s with the Clinton administration's push for the "Clipper Chip"—which would have given the government a backdoor to encrypted communications—the U.S. government has consistently pressured tech companies to weaken or bypass their own encryption. More recently, this conflict was highlighted in the 2016 dispute between the FBI and Apple. The FBI demanded Apple create software to unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters. Apple refused, arguing it would create a dangerous precedent and a master key that could be abused. While the FBI ultimately found a third party to unlock the phone, the case exemplified the intense pressure placed on private companies to assist in surveillance and law enforcement efforts, even without a clear legal mandate to compel the creation of new technology [5, 6].

*   **Post-9/11 Surveillance Programs:** Following the September 11th attacks, the National Security Agency (NSA) secretly enlisted major telecommunications companies like AT&T to provide access to vast streams of communications data, including phone records and internet traffic of American citizens, without warrants. This cooperation was extralegal, as it went beyond what was permitted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) at the time. The companies' participation was secured through appeals to patriotism and national security, as well as the implicit understanding that the government was their primary regulator [7].

### 3. Shaping Social and Political Outcomes

The government has also used its influence to pressure companies on politically sensitive issues, most notably content moderation on social media platforms.

*   **Pressure on Social Media Platforms for Content Moderation (2020-Present):** Both the Biden and Trump administrations have exerted extralegal pressure on social media companies. The Biden White House and federal agencies like the CDC repeatedly communicated with platforms like Facebook, Twitter (now X), and YouTube, urging them to more aggressively remove or suppress posts deemed "misinformation" related to COVID-19 and elections [8]. This dynamic is the subject of the landmark Supreme Court case *Murthy v. Missouri* (formerly *Missouri v. Biden*), which examines whether this sustained pressure crossed the line into unconstitutional government-coerced censorship in violation of the First Amendment [9].

*   **Operation Choke Point (2013-2017):** Under the Obama administration, the Department of Justice and bank regulators like the FDIC launched an initiative called Operation Choke Point. The stated goal was to combat mass-market consumer fraud by "choking off" fraudsters' access to the banking system. However, critics argued the program used informal pressure—such as threats of burdensome investigations and heightened regulatory scrutiny—to intimidate banks into terminating business relationships with legal but politically disfavored industries, including firearm dealers, payday lenders, and ammunition sellers, without proving any wrongdoing on the part of those specific businesses [10, 11].

### 4. Ensuring Financial Stability

During times of economic crisis, the government has used its authority to force financial institutions into actions deemed necessary for the stability of the entire system.

*   **The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Bailouts (2008):** At the height of the 2008 financial crisis, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson summoned the CEOs of the nine largest U.S. banks to a meeting and informed them they would be required to accept capital injections from the federal government. Some of the banks did not believe they needed the funds and were reluctant to accept the attached conditions. However, Paulson made it clear that participation was not optional, presenting them with documents to sign before they left the room. This was a form of coercion, using the crisis as leverage to force participation for the perceived good of the financial system as a whole, rather than allowing individual banks to opt out [12].
