Extralegal pressure by the U.S. government refers to actions taken by officials to influence corporate behavior without passing a specific law or obtaining a court order. This form of influence leverages the government's immense power—including its ability to regulate, investigate, award contracts, and shape public opinion—to persuade or coerce companies into acting in a way that aligns with the administration's goals. This pressure can be subtle or overt and has been used by administrations of both political parties.

Here are some prominent examples of extralegal pressure by the US government on corporations:

### 1. Public Statements and "Jawboning"
"Jawboning" is the use of public speeches, statements, or social media posts by high-level officials (especially the President) to pressure corporations. By publicly praising or shaming a company, the government can affect its stock price, public reputation, and consumer behavior, thereby compelling it to change course.

*   **Kennedy vs. U.S. Steel (1962):** When U.S. Steel announced a significant price increase, President John F. Kennedy publicly denounced the move as a "wholly unjustifiable and irresponsible defiance of the public interest" during a press conference. He coupled this public shaming with threats of antitrust investigations and shifting government contracts to competing steel companies. Within days, U.S. Steel rescinded the price hike [1]. This is considered a classic example of successful presidential jawboning.

*   **Trump Administration's Use of Social Media:** President Donald Trump frequently used his Twitter account to criticize or praise individual companies for their business decisions. He attacked companies like Harley-Davidson for moving production overseas and Amazon for its business practices, often leading to immediate, albeit sometimes temporary, dips in their stock prices. Conversely, he praised companies like Carrier for keeping jobs in the U.S. (after they received state tax incentives), using the presidential platform to directly influence corporate decision-making on manufacturing and employment [2].

### 2. Threats of Regulatory Action and Investigation
Government agencies can pressure industries by signaling their intent to launch investigations, enact burdensome regulations, or revoke licenses. Even without formal action, the threat can be enough to force compliance, as companies seek to avoid costly legal battles and reputational damage.

*   **Operation Choke Point (2013-2017):** This initiative by the Department of Justice (DOJ) aimed to combat consumer fraud by pressuring banks and payment processors to cut ties with businesses deemed "high-risk," such as payday lenders, firearms dealers, and other legal but politically disfavored industries. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and other regulators sent letters to banks, increasing scrutiny on their relationships with these businesses. Critics argued this was extralegal pressure, as the government was coercing banks to deny services to legal businesses without proving any wrongdoing, effectively "choking off" their access to the financial system [3, 4].

### 3. Pressure on Social Media and Content Moderation
In recent years, a significant area of extralegal pressure involves government officials contacting social media companies to encourage the removal or suppression of content they deem harmful, such as misinformation or foreign propaganda.

*   ***Murthy v. Missouri* (Formerly *Missouri v. Biden*):** This ongoing Supreme Court case examines allegations that officials from the White House, the FBI, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) unlawfully coerced social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and X (formerly Twitter) to remove or down-rank posts related to COVID-19 and election integrity. The plaintiffs argue that the government's persistent communications, veiled threats of regulatory action (like amending Section 230), and public criticism crossed the line from persuasion into unconstitutional coercion that violated users' First Amendment rights [5, 6]. The government contends it was merely working to counter dangerous misinformation in a responsible way.

### 4. National Security and Technology Sector Demands
The government often uses national security arguments to pressure technology companies for access to data or to alter their products. While some requests are made through legal channels like warrants, others represent a gray area of pressure.

*   **FBI vs. Apple (2016):** After the San Bernardino terrorist attack, the FBI publicly demanded that Apple create a new version of its operating system (a "backdoor") to bypass the security features on an attacker's iPhone. Apple CEO Tim Cook refused in a public letter, arguing that creating such a tool would compromise the security of all iPhone users. The DOJ pursued a court order, but the case highlighted the intense public and private pressure the government placed on Apple to comply, framing the issue as a matter of national security versus corporate interest [7]. The FBI ultimately dropped the case after finding a third party to unlock the phone, but the debate over encryption and government access continues.

*   **Pressure on TikTok:** The U.S. government has exerted immense pressure on ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok, to divest its U.S. operations, citing national security risks related to data privacy and potential influence by the Chinese Communist Party. This pressure has included executive orders, threats of a nationwide ban, and public campaigns by officials, culminating in legislation passed in 2024 that forces a sale or a ban. While a law was ultimately passed, years of extralegal threats preceded it, shaping the corporate and public landscape [8].

### 5. Conditional Financial Bailouts and Assistance
During times of economic crisis, the government can attach powerful, informal conditions to financial aid that go beyond the letter of the law.

*   **The 2008 Financial Crisis (TARP):** During the 2008 financial crisis, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson convened the CEOs of the nine largest U.S. banks and pressured them to accept capital injections from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Some bank leaders were reportedly reluctant, believing their institutions were stable and that accepting the funds would signal weakness. However, Paulson made it clear that participation was not truly optional, arguing it was necessary for the stability of the entire financial system. The banks ultimately agreed, demonstrating how the government can use its role as a lender of last resort to compel action from an entire industry [9].
