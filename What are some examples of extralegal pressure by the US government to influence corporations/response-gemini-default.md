Extralegal pressure by the U.S. government refers to actions taken by executive branch officials, agencies, or members of Congress to influence corporate behavior without passing a specific law or obtaining a court order. This type of influence operates in a gray area, leveraging the government's immense power—such as the threat of future regulation, public shaming, the promise of government contracts, or the initiation of burdensome investigations—to achieve policy goals. It is distinct from formal legal actions like antitrust lawsuits or the enforcement of existing regulations.

Below are several prominent examples of this practice, categorized by the primary method of pressure used.

### 1. Public "Jawboning" and Shaming

"Jawboning" is the use of public statements, speeches, and social media by high-level officials (especially the President) to pressure companies into taking or refraining from certain actions. This tactic relies on the power of the bully pulpit to shape public opinion and create negative press for a targeted corporation.

*   **The Kennedy Administration vs. U.S. Steel (1962):** This is a classic example of presidential jawboning. When U.S. Steel announced a significant price increase, President John F. Kennedy felt it was inflationary and against the public interest. In a press conference, he publicly condemned the company's leaders for their "utter contempt" for the country. Behind the scenes, the administration launched an FBI investigation into price-fixing, had the Department of Defense threaten to award contracts to competing firms, and had the FTC begin an inquiry. Faced with this immense public and private pressure, U.S. Steel rescinded the price hike within days [1].

*   **The Trump Administration's Use of Twitter:** President Donald Trump frequently used his Twitter account to publicly praise or attack companies based on their business decisions, particularly regarding offshoring and domestic investment. In 2016, he repeatedly criticized Carrier, an air conditioner manufacturer, for its plans to move jobs to Mexico. The subsequent deal, which kept some jobs in Indiana, was reached after a combination of public pressure and the offering of state-level tax incentives, a negotiation heavily influenced by the President-elect's public campaign [2]. He similarly targeted companies like Ford, General Motors, and Boeing with threats of tariffs or lost government contracts, often leading them to issue public statements or alter plans [3].

*   **The Biden Administration and Oil Companies (2022):** Amid soaring gasoline prices, President Joe Biden and his administration publicly called out major oil companies for generating record profits while consumers struggled. The President accused them of "war profiteering" and urged them to increase production and lower prices at the pump. He threatened the possibility of a "windfall tax" on their profits if they did not act. While no tax was formally proposed in Congress at the time, the persistent public criticism was a form of extralegal pressure aimed at influencing corporate pricing and investment strategies [4].

### 2. National Security and Foreign Policy Levers

The executive branch often uses its broad authority in national security and foreign policy to influence corporations, particularly in the technology and telecommunications sectors. This pressure is often justified as necessary to protect the country from foreign adversaries or terrorism.

*   **The Apple vs. FBI Case (2016):** After the San Bernardino terrorist attack in 2015, the FBI recovered an iPhone belonging to one of the shooters. The phone was locked, and the FBI sought Apple's help to bypass its security features. When Apple refused, citing the dangerous precedent it would set for user privacy, the Department of Justice obtained a court order to compel them. However, alongside this legal process, the government waged a significant public pressure campaign. FBI Director James Comey wrote public letters and gave interviews framing Apple's stance as a threat to public safety. This was an attempt to use public opinion and the weight of national security to force the company's hand outside the narrow confines of the legal argument [5]. The FBI eventually dropped the case after it found a third party to unlock the phone.

*   **Pressure on U.S. Companies Regarding China (Huawei and TikTok):** The U.S. government has exerted significant pressure on American companies to sever ties with Chinese technology firms like Huawei and ByteDance (the parent company of TikTok). While some of this was done through formal actions like placing Huawei on the Entity List (restricting sales of U.S. technology), much of the initial groundwork involved informal warnings and briefings from intelligence and State Department officials to U.S. tech and telecom executives. They warned that using Huawei's equipment or partnering with these firms posed a national security risk and could jeopardize future government contracts and regulatory goodwill, long before formal bans were in place [6].

### 3. Informal Regulatory and Antitrust Threats

Government agencies can signal their intent to launch costly and time-consuming investigations or to apply unfavorable regulatory interpretations to pressure companies. This creates uncertainty and can coerce a company into changing its behavior to avoid a formal battle.

*   **Operation Choke Point (2013-2017):** This Department of Justice and FDIC initiative is a controversial example of using regulatory pressure. The government's stated goal was to combat mass-market consumer fraud by "choking off" fraudsters' access to the banking system. However, critics allege that regulators used informal guidance and the threat of heightened scrutiny to pressure banks into terminating relationships with entire categories of legal but "high-risk" or politically disfavored businesses, such as firearms dealers, payday lenders, and ammunition sellers. A House Oversight Committee report concluded that the FDIC "knowingly and purposefully coached banks to terminate client relationships" with these legal businesses, representing a form of extralegal pressure [7].

*   **Microsoft and the Department of Justice (1990s):** Before the landmark antitrust suit *United States v. Microsoft Corp.* was filed in 1998, the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission spent years in a back-and-forth with the company. During this period, government officials frequently expressed "concerns" about Microsoft's practice of bundling its Internet Explorer browser with Windows. These informal discussions and preliminary investigations served as a form of sustained pressure, signaling that the company's aggressive competitive tactics were under intense scrutiny and could lead to a full-blown legal assault if they were not modified [8].
