Extralegal pressure refers to actions taken by government officials to influence or coerce corporations that fall outside of formally established legal or regulatory procedures. Instead of passing a law, issuing a formal regulation, or obtaining a court order, the government uses its immense power, public platform, and discretionary authority to persuade or intimidate companies into taking or refraining from certain actions. This type of pressure is often controversial, as it operates in a gray area between legitimate governance and potential overreach.

Below are several prominent examples of extralegal pressure by the U.S. government, categorized by the method of influence.

### 1. Public Pressure and "Jawboning"

This tactic, often called "jawboning" or using the "bully pulpit," involves high-ranking officials publicly shaming, criticizing, or threatening a company or industry to compel a change in behavior. The pressure comes from the risk of reputational damage and the implied threat of future government action.

*   **Kennedy Administration vs. U.S. Steel (1962):** After U.S. Steel announced a significant price increase, President John F. Kennedy publicly denounced the move as an irresponsible, "wholly unjustifiable and defiant" act that threatened national economic stability. Behind the scenes, the administration launched an FBI investigation into potential price-fixing, and the Department of Defense hinted at shifting contracts to companies that did not raise prices. Facing immense public and private pressure, U.S. Steel rescinded the price increase within 72 hours [1].

*   **Trump Administration's Use of Social Media (2016-2020):** President Donald Trump frequently used his Twitter account to publicly pressure corporations. He criticized companies like Ford, General Motors, and Harley-Davidson for moving manufacturing jobs overseas and praised companies like Carrier for keeping jobs in the U.S. after his intervention. This public shaming and praise campaign was designed to influence corporate decisions on hiring and plant locations through direct, informal pressure, separate from any specific trade law or tax policy [2].

*   **Biden Administration on Gas Prices (2022):** As gasoline prices soared, President Joe Biden and his administration publicly accused major oil and gas companies of profiteering and price gouging. The President stated that companies enjoying record profits had a patriotic duty to increase production and lower prices for consumers. This rhetoric was not tied to a specific law but was intended to pressure the industry into changing its pricing and investment behavior under the threat of public anger and potential future legislative action, such as a "windfall tax" [3].

### 2. The Threat of Investigation or Unfavorable Regulation

The government can exert significant pressure by signaling its intent to launch a burdensome investigation or pursue new, unfavorable regulations. The mere threat can be enough to secure a company's cooperation, as corporations often seek to avoid the cost, distraction, and negative publicity of a formal government inquiry.

*   **Content Moderation and Section 230:** Internal documents from Twitter (the "Twitter Files") and other reporting have revealed extensive communication between federal agencies (including the FBI, DHS, and White House) and social media platforms. These communications often involved government officials flagging specific posts and accounts for review related to misinformation or foreign influence. Critics argue this created a system of extralegal pressure, where platforms felt compelled to comply with these "requests" to maintain a good relationship with the government and avoid the threat of more aggressive regulation, such as the repeal or modification of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields them from liability for user-generated content [4, 5].

*   **Antitrust Scrutiny as Leverage:** The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have the power to launch antitrust investigations. While these are formal legal tools, the threat of opening a broad, expensive, and years-long investigation can be used informally to pressure companies into altering their business practices "voluntarily." For example, the announcement of a wide-ranging antitrust probe into a major tech company can persuade it to change its app store policies or data collection practices to avoid a protracted legal battle, even if its current practices are technically legal [6].

### 3. Leveraging Government Contracts and Merger Approvals

The federal government is the single largest customer in the country and holds gatekeeping power over major corporate mergers. This authority can be used as leverage to extract concessions from companies on matters unrelated to the specific contract or merger under review.

*   **AT&T-Time Warner Merger (2017-2018):** During the proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner, President Trump, a vocal critic of CNN (a Time Warner asset), publicly stated his opposition. The DOJ's subsequent lawsuit to block the deal was seen by many observers as politically motivated. This created a powerful form of extralegal pressure, suggesting that the president's personal animosity toward a news organization was influencing the formal antitrust review process. The implication was that corporate behavior (in this case, CNN's news coverage) could affect its parent company's strategic goals [7].

### 4. Informal and Classified National Security Requests

In the realm of national security, government agencies often pressure companies to provide data or technical assistance through channels that lack formal, public judicial oversight.

*   **NSA Surveillance Programs:** As revealed by Edward Snowden in 2013, the National Security Agency (NSA) engaged in the bulk collection of telephone metadata from telecom companies like Verizon and AT&T. While some of this was compelled by secret court orders under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), reports indicated that a great deal of cooperation was secured through informal pressure. Companies felt they had no choice but to comply with government requests for fear of being seen as unpatriotic or uncooperative, which could jeopardize their critical infrastructure licenses and government contracts [8].

*   **FBI-Apple Encryption Dispute (2016):** After the San Bernardino terrorist attack, the FBI publicly demanded that Apple create a new version of its operating system to bypass the security features on one of the shooter's iPhones. While the FBI eventually sought a court order, FBI Director James Comey first engaged in a high-profile public pressure campaign. He framed the issue as "patriotism versus profit," attempting to force Apple to comply by turning public opinion against the company before the courts could rule on the complex legal questions involved. This was an attempt to achieve a goal through public coercion that the government was not certain it could win through formal legal means [9].

It directly expresses the administration's view that oil companies' high profits during a time of war are "not acceptable" and urges them to increase refining capacity and output. The letter itself is a tool of public and direct pressure.

    *   **Author's View:** Journalist Matt Taibbi, in the first installment of the "Twitter Files," presents internal company documents to argue that there was a close and informal working relationship between Twitter and government officials. His view is that the line between content moderation based on company policy and compliance with government requests became blurred, with government pressure playing a significant role.

    *   **Author's View:** Professor Kate Klonick provides a legal and academic analysis of the "Twitter Files." She argues that while the interactions are concerning and highlight the problem of "jawboning," they do not necessarily constitute a clear First Amendment violation without evidence of direct coercion. Her view is that the situation exposes a deep, structural problem in how the government informally influences powerful platforms.

While reporting on a formal legal process, the article illustrates the immense pressure such a move puts on a company. The context of years-long scrutiny and public threats from politicians demonstrates how the antitrust apparatus itself can be a tool of pressure long before a case is ever decided.

He presents the case as a stark example of a president using the levers of government power (specifically the DOJ's antitrust division) to punish a news organization for coverage he disliked.

    *   **Author's View:** Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who broke the Snowden story, argues that the U.S. government built a massive surveillance apparatus that relied on the coerced, secret cooperation of major telecommunications and internet companies.
