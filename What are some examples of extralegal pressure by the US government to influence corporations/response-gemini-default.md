Extralegal pressure by the U.S. government refers to actions taken to influence corporate behavior that fall outside of formally enacted laws, regulations, or judicial orders. Instead of passing a new law or filing a lawsuit, government officials—from the President to agency heads—use the immense power, influence, and authority of their positions to persuade, coerce, or "jawbone" companies into making certain decisions. This is often done to achieve policy goals more quickly than the legislative process would allow or to address issues not easily covered by existing law.

These methods are controversial because they can circumvent the principles of due process and the rule of law, creating an unpredictable environment for businesses and potentially amounting to an abuse of power. Below are several examples categorized by the type of pressure applied.

### 1. Public Shaming and "Jawboning"

This is perhaps the most common form of extralegal pressure, where officials use public statements, speeches, or social media to praise or condemn corporate actions, thereby leveraging public opinion to influence a company.

*   **Kennedy vs. Steel Companies (1962):** This is the classic historical example of "jawboning." When U.S. Steel announced a significant price increase, President John F. Kennedy publicly denounced the move as an irresponsible, "wholly unjustifiable and irresponsible defiance of the public interest." His administration coupled this public condemnation with private threats of antitrust investigations and shifting government contracts to other companies. Within days, U.S. Steel and other steel companies rescinded the price hikes [1].

*   **President Trump's Use of Twitter (2016-2021):** President Donald Trump frequently used his Twitter account to directly pressure individual companies. He publicly criticized companies like Ford for moving jobs to Mexico, Carrier for plans to close a U.S. factory, and Boeing over the cost of Air Force One. Conversely, he praised companies that announced investments in the U.S. This direct and often unpredictable pressure was intended to influence corporate decisions on manufacturing, outsourcing, and pricing [2].

*   **Biden Administration on Gas Prices (2022-2023):** Facing high inflation and gasoline prices, President Joe Biden and his administration publicly called on oil and gas companies to increase production and lower prices at the pump. The White House accused them of "profiteering" from the war in Ukraine and threatened a windfall profits tax if they did not act. This public pressure campaign was designed to compel energy firms to change their pricing and investment strategies without new legislation [3].

### 2. The Threat of Investigation or Adverse Regulation

Government agencies hold significant discretionary power to investigate companies or enact burdensome regulations. The mere suggestion that this power might be used can be enough to alter corporate behavior, even if no formal action is ever taken.

*   **Operation Choke Point (c. 2013-2017):** This initiative by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and bank regulators like the FDIC is a highly controversial example. The government's stated goal was to combat mass-market consumer fraud by cutting off fraudulent merchants' access to the banking system. However, critics allege the program went much further, using informal pressure on banks to terminate their relationships with entire categories of legal but politically disfavored businesses, such as payday lenders, firearms dealers, and ammunition sellers. The pressure came in the form of heightened regulatory scrutiny and suggestions that servicing these clients was a "reputational risk," effectively choking off their financial lifelines without proving any wrongdoing [4, 5].

*   **Antitrust Scrutiny of Big Tech:** For years, officials in both the executive branch and Congress have threatened major technology companies (like Google, Meta, Amazon, and Apple) with antitrust investigations and breakups. This constant threat has a chilling effect on corporate strategy, potentially influencing decisions on mergers, acquisitions, and new product launches. Companies may self-censor or abandon business plans to avoid provoking a full-scale, costly, and potentially business-ending confrontation with regulators like the DOJ or FTC [6].

### 3. Informal Requests and National Security Concerns

Particularly in the realms of national security and law enforcement, the government often makes informal requests for cooperation that carry the implicit weight of its authority.

*   **Government Pressure on Social Media Content Moderation:** Following the 2016 election and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. government officials from the FBI, CDC, and the White House allegedly maintained regular, informal channels of communication with social media companies like Twitter (now X) and Facebook (now Meta). The stated purpose was to flag foreign disinformation and public health misinformation. However, critics and internal company documents (popularized as the "Twitter Files") suggest this evolved into a pressure campaign to censor or de-amplify specific content, viewpoints, and accounts, including those of domestic critics and journalists. This dynamic led to the landmark lawsuit *Missouri v. Biden*, in which courts are examining whether this pressure crossed the line into unconstitutional government coercion that violated the First Amendment [7, 8].

*   **CFIUS and the TikTok Case:** The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has the formal power to review and block foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies on national security grounds. However, the *threat* of a negative CFIUS review is a powerful extralegal tool. With TikTok, the Trump and Biden administrations used the threat of an outright ban to pressure its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, into a forced sale or divestiture of its U.S. operations. This pressure exists outside of a specific law banning the app (which came later) and uses the broad discretion of national security authority to dictate corporate structure [9].

### 4. Leveraging Government Contracts and Financial Power

As the world's single largest customer, the U.S. government can use its procurement and financial power to influence corporate behavior.

*   **Encouraging ESG and Domestic Sourcing:** Administrations can signal that companies aligning with certain policy goals—such as environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards, diversity initiatives, or domestic manufacturing—will be looked upon more favorably when competing for federal contracts. While formal procurement rules exist, there is significant discretion in how contracts are awarded. This subtle, informal guidance can push companies to adopt policies they otherwise might not, in hopes of securing lucrative government work [10].
