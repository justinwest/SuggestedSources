# Why do some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel?

Biblical and theological convictions

1. The Abrahamic covenant  
   • Genesis 12:1-3, 15:18 and 17:7 are read as an everlasting, unconditional promise that God gave the land of Canaan to Abraham’s physical descendants.  
   • Because God’s character is portrayed in Scripture as faithful to His covenants (e.g., Psalm 105:8-11; Romans 11:29), many Christians conclude that the promise is still in force. Honoring that promise by supporting the modern State of Israel is therefore seen as honoring God.

2. “Bless those who bless you”  
   • Genesis 12:3—“I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse”—is interpreted personally and nationally. Supporting Israel, these Christians believe, invites divine favor; opposing Israel risks divine disfavor.

3. Israel as God’s “chosen people”  
   • Passages such as Deuteronomy 7:6 and Romans 9–11 are understood to teach that God’s election of the Jewish people has never been revoked. Paul’s statement that “the gifts and calling of God are irrevocable” (Romans 11:29) is central. Hence, standing with Israel is viewed as standing with God’s ongoing redemptive plan.

Eschatological (end-times) expectations

4. Dispensationalism and the two-track plan of God  
   • Popular among many evangelical Protestants, dispensational theology distinguishes between “Israel” and “the Church.” The regathering of Jews to their ancient homeland is considered a prophetic sign (cf. Ezekiel 36–37) that precedes the Tribulation, the rise of the Antichrist, and the Second Coming.  
   • Supporting Israel therefore becomes participation in God’s unfolding timetable.

5. Fulfillment of prophecies about national restoration  
   • Isaiah 11:11-12, Jeremiah 31:35-37, Amos 9:14-15 and others predict a final return of the Jewish people to the land. The founding of the State of Israel in 1948, the ingathering of diaspora Jews and Israeli control of Jerusalem after 1967 are all seen as literal fulfillments, reinforcing the sense of religious duty.

6. Preparations for the Messiah’s return  
   • Some Christians believe certain events—rebuilding the Temple, Jewish control of Jerusalem, a national turning of Israel to faith in the Messiah (Romans 11:26)—must occur before Jesus returns. Active support for Israel is regarded as helping pave the way.

Scriptural calls to prayer and peace

7. Psalm 122:6—“Pray for the peace of Jerusalem”  
   • This verse is frequently cited in sermons and prayer meetings, turning support for Israel into a concrete act of obedience.

Historical-ethical motivations

8. Rejection of replacement theology  
   • After centuries in which many churches taught that the Church had “replaced” Israel, a growing number of Christians now repudiate that doctrine. Affirming Israel’s continued place in God’s purposes is a corrective they feel bound to make.

9. Post-Holocaust repentance  
   • Awareness of Christian complicity—direct or indirect—in antisemitism and the Holocaust has led some believers to an ethic of solidarity with the Jewish people, expressed politically through support for Israel’s security.

Political and cultural affinities

10. Shared democratic and moral values  
    • Israel is perceived as a democracy with freedoms of worship and speech in a region where Christians often face persecution. Supporting Israel is seen as aligning with religious liberty and Judeo-Christian ethical norms.

Institutional reinforcement

11. Churches, ministries and lobby groups  
    • Organizations such as Christians United for Israel (CUFI), the International Christian Embassy Jerusalem (ICEJ) and numerous evangelical media channels teach and mobilize believers around the convictions listed above, framing support for Israel as an act of discipleship.

Nuances and diversity

• These reasons do not represent all Christians. Eastern Orthodox, most Roman Catholics and many mainline Protestants either maintain a more nuanced stance or emphasize Palestinian rights alongside Israel’s security.  
• Nevertheless, for millions—especially in evangelical and Pentecostal circles—the combination of biblical covenant beliefs, prophecy expectations, moral repentance and perceived shared values creates the conviction that supporting Israel is a religious obligation.
