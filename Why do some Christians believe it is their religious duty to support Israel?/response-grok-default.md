# Why do some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel?

Some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel due to a combination of theological, historical, and biblical interpretations rooted in their faith. This belief is particularly prominent among certain evangelical and fundamentalist Christian groups, though it is not universally held across all Christian denominations. Below are the key reasons behind this perspective, organized into theological, biblical, and practical dimensions.

**1. Biblical Foundations and Covenant Theology**  
A primary reason for Christian support of Israel stems from the belief in God's covenant with the Jewish people as described in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). In Genesis 12:3, God promises Abraham, the patriarch of the Jewish people, "I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you." Many Christians interpret this as a divine mandate to support the descendants of Abraham, understood to be the Jewish people and, by extension, the modern state of Israel. They believe that supporting Israel aligns them with God's will and brings divine favor, while opposing Israel risks divine judgment.

Additionally, some Christians adhere to a theology that views the Jewish people as God's "chosen people," a status that remains intact even after the coming of Jesus Christ. This perspective holds that God's promises to Israel, including the land of Canaan (modern-day Israel), are eternal and irrevocable, as reiterated in passages like Jeremiah 31:35-37. For these Christians, supporting Israel is a way of honoring God's enduring covenant.

**2. Eschatological Beliefs and the Role of Israel in End Times Prophecy**  
A significant factor driving Christian support for Israel is rooted in eschatology, the study of end times or the "last days." Many evangelical Christians, particularly those who follow dispensationalist theology, believe that the reestablishment of Israel as a nation in 1948 fulfills biblical prophecies, such as those found in Ezekiel 36-37, which speak of the restoration of the Jewish people to their ancestral land. They see this as a sign of the approaching Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

In this theological framework, Israel plays a central role in the unfolding of end times events. For instance, some interpret passages in the Book of Revelation and Daniel as indicating that the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem and the return of Jews to Israel are prerequisites for Christ’s return. Supporting Israel, therefore, is seen as facilitating God's prophetic plan. This belief often leads to strong political and financial support for the state of Israel, as well as advocacy for policies that protect its sovereignty.

**3. Historical and Moral Considerations**  
Beyond theology, some Christians feel a moral obligation to support Israel due to historical events, particularly the Holocaust. The atrocities committed against the Jewish people during World War II have led many Christians to view the establishment of Israel as a necessary refuge and a form of restitution for centuries of persecution, including instances where Christian communities were complicit in anti-Semitism. Supporting Israel is seen as a way to atone for past wrongs and to stand against anti-Semitism in the present.

Additionally, some Christians see Israel as a democratic ally in a volatile region, sharing values of religious freedom and human rights (though this view is debated). This geopolitical alignment often reinforces their religious convictions, blending faith with practical support for Israel as a modern nation-state.

**4. Christian Zionism**  
A specific subset of Christians, often referred to as Christian Zionists, actively promotes the idea that supporting Israel is a religious duty. Christian Zionism emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries, influenced by dispensationalist theology and figures like John Nelson Darby and Cyrus Scofield, whose Scofield Reference Bible popularized the idea of Israel's central role in prophecy. Christian Zionists advocate for policies that strengthen Israel, such as recognizing Jerusalem as its capital or opposing territorial concessions in peace negotiations, viewing these actions as consistent with biblical mandates.

**5. Diversity of Christian Perspectives**  
It is important to note that not all Christians share this view. Some denominations, including many mainline Protestant churches and Catholic teachings, emphasize a more nuanced or critical stance toward the modern state of Israel, focusing on justice, peace, and the rights of Palestinians. They may interpret biblical promises to Israel as spiritual rather than literal, or they may prioritize Jesus’ teachings on reconciliation and love for all people over a specific geopolitical allegiance. However, for those who do see supporting Israel as a religious duty, the belief is often deeply personal and tied to their understanding of Scripture and God’s plan for humanity.

**Conclusion**  
In summary, the belief among some Christians that supporting Israel is a religious duty arises from a combination of biblical interpretation, covenant theology, eschatological expectations, historical guilt, and geopolitical alignment. Central to this view are the ideas that God’s promises to the Jewish people remain valid, that Israel’s restoration is a fulfillment of prophecy, and that blessing Israel aligns believers with God’s will. While this perspective is not universal among Christians, it remains a powerful motivator for many, particularly within evangelical and Zionist circles, shaping both personal faith and political advocacy.
