# Why do some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel?

Many Christians, particularly evangelical Christians, believe it is their religious duty to support Israel due to a combination of theological, historical, and prophetic reasons rooted in their interpretation of the Bible. This belief is especially prominent among evangelicals in the United States, who form a significant political and cultural force. Below, I outline the primary reasons for this conviction, drawing from the provided sources and additional context.

First, a key theological foundation for this support is the belief in the Abrahamic Covenant, as described in the Book of Genesis. In Genesis 12:3, God promises Abraham, the patriarch of the Jewish people, that He will bless those who bless Abraham’s descendants and curse those who curse them. Many evangelicals interpret this as a divine mandate to support the modern state of Israel, seen as the continuation of the biblical Jewish people. This perspective holds that supporting Israel aligns with God’s will and brings divine favor, while opposing Israel risks divine judgment [1].

Second, evangelical support for Israel is often tied to eschatological (end-times) beliefs, particularly the doctrine of premillennial dispensationalism. This theological framework, popular among many evangelicals, posits that the return of Jesus Christ is contingent upon specific events involving Israel, including the reestablishment of the Jewish state and the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem. According to this view, the creation of Israel in 1948 is seen as a fulfillment of biblical prophecy and a sign of the approaching end times. Evangelicals who hold this belief feel a religious duty to support Israel to facilitate the unfolding of these prophetic events, which they believe will culminate in Christ’s Second Coming [1][2].

Third, some Christians view Israel as a key ally in a spiritual and geopolitical struggle. They see the Jewish state as a bastion of shared Judeo-Christian values in a region often perceived as hostile to those values. This perspective is reinforced by historical narratives of Israel as a democratic nation surrounded by adversaries, which resonates with evangelical Christians who prioritize religious freedom and see Israel as a partner in defending such principles. This view often translates into political advocacy, as seen in the strong support for pro-Israel policies among evangelical communities in the United States [2].

Additionally, historical and cultural factors play a role. Evangelicals have long been influenced by a sense of solidarity with the Jewish people, partly due to a shared history of persecution and a recognition of the Holocaust’s horrors. This empathy, combined with the theological reasons mentioned, fosters a sense of obligation to stand with Israel as a form of moral and religious duty [1].

However, it is important to note that not all Christians share this view. Some Christian denominations and theologians argue against unconditional support for Israel, emphasizing justice, peace, and the rights of Palestinians. They may interpret biblical texts differently or prioritize ethical considerations over prophetic interpretations. Despite this diversity of opinion, the evangelical perspective remains highly influential, particularly in American politics, where it has shaped policies such as the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital under President Trump, a move strongly supported by evangelical leaders [2].

In conclusion, the belief among some Christians, especially evangelicals, that supporting Israel is a religious duty stems from biblical interpretations of God’s covenant with Abraham, eschatological expectations tied to Israel’s role in end-times prophecy, and a sense of shared values and historical solidarity. While this view is not universal among Christians, it holds significant sway in certain communities and continues to influence religious and political landscapes.
