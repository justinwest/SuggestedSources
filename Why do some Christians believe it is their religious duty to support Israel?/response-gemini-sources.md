# Why do some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel?

The belief among some Christians, particularly within American Evangelicalism, that they have a religious duty to support the state of Israel is rooted in a specific theological framework known as Christian Zionism [2]. This perspective is based on a literal interpretation of biblical scripture, particularly concerning God's covenants and end-times prophecy [1].

The core tenets of this belief include:

1.  **The Abrahamic Covenant**: The foundational belief stems from God's promise to Abraham in the book of Genesis. Many Christian Zionists point to Genesis 12:3, where God says to Abraham, "I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse" [1]. They interpret this as a timeless, binding command to support Abraham's descendants, the Jewish people, and by extension, the modern state of Israel. Adhering to this is seen as a way to receive God's blessing and avoid His curse [1, 2].

2.  **Dispensational Premillennialism**: This belief system, which gained prominence in the 19th century through the teachings of John Nelson Darby, provides the theological structure for Christian Zionism [1]. Dispensationalism posits that God has distinct plans for the nation of Israel and for the Christian Church. It rejects "replacement theology," the idea that the Church has replaced Israel in God's plan. Instead, it holds that God's promises of land and nationhood to Israel are literal and are yet to be completely fulfilled [1].

3.  **Fulfillment of End-Times Prophecy**: Christian Zionists see the establishment of the modern state of Israel in 1948 and the subsequent gathering of Jewish people in that land as a direct fulfillment of biblical prophecies found in books like Ezekiel, Daniel, and Revelation [1]. They believe these events are necessary precursors to the "end times," a sequence of events that includes the rise of the Antichrist, the Tribulation, and ultimately, the Second Coming of Jesus Christ [2]. Therefore, supporting a politically secure and sovereign Israel is viewed as helping to fulfill God's prophetic timeline and hasten Christ's return [1, 2].

4.  **Political and Foreign Policy Implications**: This theological conviction translates directly into political action. For these evangelicals, supporting Israel is not merely a foreign policy preference but a biblical mandate [2]. This belief drives strong support for U.S. policies that bolster Israel's security and sovereignty, such as providing financial aid and recognizing Jerusalem as its capital. This conviction makes the evangelical community a powerful and reliable pro-Israel political bloc in the United States [2].

In summary, for a significant segment of Christians, support for Israel is a religious duty derived from a literal reading of God's covenant with Abraham, a theological system that sees a distinct and ongoing role for the Jewish nation, and a belief that a strong Israel is a key component of end-times prophecy.

1.  **Timothy P. Weber in *The Christian Century***. Weber, a historian of American evangelicalism, explains that evangelical support for Israel is rooted in dispensational premillennialism, a theology developed in the 19th century. He argues that this view's literal interpretation of biblical prophecy—seeing modern Israel's existence as a necessary step for the Second Coming of Christ and citing the Genesis 12:3 covenant—is the primary driver for this unwavering support.

2.  **Elizabeth Oldmixon in *The Washington Post***. Oldmixon, a political scientist, frames the issue in terms of political influence, explaining that Christian Zionism is the theological foundation for the powerful pro-Israel sentiment among American evangelicals. She asserts that their belief in biblical prophecy regarding Israel's role in the "end times" makes supporting Israeli sovereignty a religious obligation, which in turn profoundly shapes U.S. foreign policy.
