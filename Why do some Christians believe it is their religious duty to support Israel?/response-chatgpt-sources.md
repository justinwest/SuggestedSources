# Why do some Christians believe it is their religious duty to support Israel?

Many Christians, especially white U.S. evangelicals, regard support for the modern state of Israel not merely as a political preference but as a religious obligation.  Their conviction rests on three inter-locking ideas that have been preached in churches, amplified by best-selling Bibles and prophecy books, and institutionalized in activist organizations over the last 150 years.

1. A continuing, unconditional biblical covenant with the Jewish people  
   • Dispensationalist interpreters—from 19th-century pastor John Nelson Darby to the annotated Scofield Reference Bible (1909)—teach that God’s promise to Abraham that “I will bless those who bless you” (Gen. 12:3) is eternally binding. If the promise is permanent, then Christians who want God’s blessing must stand with the Jewish people and their state [1].  
   • Surveys show that 80 percent of white evangelicals say “God gave the land of Israel to the Jewish people,” a far higher share than any other U.S. religious group [2].  For believers who read the Bible this way, aiding Israel is obedience to God, not simply geopolitics.

2. Prophetic expectations about the End Times  
   • Dispensationalists also contend that the return of Jews to their ancient homeland is a prerequisite for the Second Coming of Christ.  The Six-Day War (1967) and Israel’s capture of Jerusalem were interpreted as dramatic confirmation of prophecy and made “support for Israel almost an article of faith among conservative Protestants” [1].  
   • Popular prophecy writers (Hal Lindsey, Tim LaHaye) and pastors such as John Hagee teach that protecting Israel helps set the stage for events foretold in Ezekiel, Daniel and Revelation; therefore Christians have a duty to help Israel survive until Christ returns [2].

3. Organized Christian Zionism that turns theology into activism  
   • Beginning with Jerry Falwell in the 1970s and carried forward by Hagee’s Christians United for Israel (CUFI), evangelical leaders have institutionalized these beliefs, framing lobbying, tourism and financial gifts as part of a Christian vocation to “bless Israel” [2].  
   • This religious network helped shape U.S. policy: for example, President Trump’s 2017 decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital was championed by evangelical advisers who cited biblical rather than strategic arguments [2].

Additional moral and cultural motives reinforce the theological ones—gratitude for the Hebrew roots of Christianity, remorse over Christian anti-Judaism and the Holocaust, and identification with a fellow “people of faith” in a hostile Middle East—but the core sense of duty flows from the conviction that God’s revealed plan still centers on the Jewish people and their land.  For these Christians, standing with Israel is standing with God, and failing to do so risks divine displeasure, making support a sacred rather than merely political task.
