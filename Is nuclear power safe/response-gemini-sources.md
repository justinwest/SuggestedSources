Based on the provided sources, nuclear power is considered one of the safest forms of energy. This conclusion is based on statistical data on death rates per unit of energy produced and the robust international safety frameworks governing the industry.

### Statistical Safety and Comparisons
Data analysis from Our World in Data shows that nuclear power has one of the lowest death rates of any energy source [1]. The death rate for nuclear energy, which includes fatalities from accidents and occupational hazards, is estimated to be 0.03 deaths per terawatt-hour (TWh) of electricity produced. This figure is on par with the safest renewable sources like solar (0.02 deaths/TWh) and wind (0.04 deaths/TWh) [1].

Crucially, nuclear power is significantly safer than fossil fuels. For comparison, the death rate for coal is 24.6 deaths per TWh—over 800 times higher than nuclear—primarily due to the health impacts of air pollution. Oil is also substantially more dangerous, with 18.4 deaths per TWh [1]. The data for nuclear energy is comprehensive, as it incorporates the estimated long-term deaths from the two worst nuclear accidents in history, Chernobyl and Fukushima [1]. Even with these events factored in, nuclear power remains one of the safest ways to generate electricity [1].

### Regulatory and Operational Safety
The high level of safety in the nuclear sector is achieved through a stringent and continuously improving global safety framework, which is overseen by organizations like the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) [2]. The IAEA's *Nuclear Safety Review 2024* highlights that the operational safety performance of nuclear power plants worldwide remains strong [2].

This safety is maintained through several key efforts:
*   **International Standards:** The IAEA establishes and promotes harmonized safety standards that are adopted by member states to ensure a high level of protection everywhere [2].
*   **Continuous Improvement:** The global nuclear community actively learns from operational experience and events, including past accidents. Lessons from the Fukushima Daiichi accident, for example, have been integrated into safety standards and plant operations globally to enhance resilience against extreme external events [2].
*   **Regulatory Oversight:** The framework relies on strong, independent national regulatory bodies to enforce safety standards, conduct inspections, and oversee all aspects of plant operation, from siting and design to decommissioning [2].
*   **Future-Focused Safety:** Safety is a core principle in the design of new nuclear technologies, such as Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), which often incorporate passive safety features that rely on natural forces like gravity to shut down a reactor, reducing the need for active human intervention [2].

### Ongoing Challenges
While the safety record is strong, the IAEA acknowledges that maintaining and enhancing safety is an ongoing process. The organization identifies several areas requiring continued vigilance, including:
*   The long-term management of radioactive waste [2].
*   Ensuring the safety and security of nuclear facilities during armed conflicts, as highlighted by the situation in Ukraine [2].
*   Managing the safety of aging nuclear power plants through long-term operation programs [2].

In conclusion, the provided sources indicate that nuclear power is safe. Its statistical death rate per unit of energy is comparable to the safest renewables and dramatically lower than fossil fuels [1]. This safety record is not accidental but the result of a robust, multi-layered international regulatory framework that emphasizes continuous improvement, operational excellence, and a deeply ingrained safety culture [2].

1.  **Our World in Data, "Safest sources of energy"**: The author, Hannah Ritchie, presents a data-driven view, arguing that nuclear energy is one of the safest sources available. The analysis focuses on death rates per unit of energy produced, comparing nuclear, fossil fuels, and renewables. It emphasizes that when measured by deaths per unit of energy, nuclear is far safer than fossil fuels, even when accounting for major accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima.

The report details the robust global framework designed to ensure safety across the lifecycle of nuclear facilities. The view is that safety is an ongoing, managed process that requires continuous vigilance, international cooperation, and adherence to stringent standards to address existing and emerging challenges.
