# Is nuclear power safe?

Is nuclear power safe?  

1.  How the risks compare with other energy sources  
   •  When deaths from accidents and the air-pollution that power stations create are counted together, nuclear energy ranks among the very safest ways to make electricity.  Our World in Data calculates ≈0.07 deaths per terawatt-hour (TWh) produced, versus 24.6 for coal, 18.4 for oil, and 2.8 for natural gas [1].  Solar (0.02) and wind (0.04) are similarly low, but nuclear already supplies far more continuous output and avoids the large mortality burden of fossil fuels.

2.  What the accident record shows  
   •  Three commercial accidents reached the top half of the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES):  
     – Three Mile Island, USA (1979, INES-5): no radiation fatalities.  
     – Chernobyl, USSR (1986, INES-7): 28 acute deaths and about 4 000 potential long-term cancer deaths among the most-exposed groups according to WHO/IAEA assessments [4].  
     – Fukushima Daiichi, Japan (2011, INES-7): no radiation deaths; UNSCEAR finds population doses “too low for observable health effects,” though the evacuation itself caused roughly 50 indirect deaths and major social disruption [3].  
   •  Since Fukushima there has been no INES level-4 or higher accident anywhere in the world [2].

3.  Why today’s plants are safer than yesterday’s  
   •  New “Generation III+” reactors use passive safety—gravity-fed cooling, large water inventories or negative-temperature-coefficient fuel—that can keep cores stable for days without operator action.  
   •  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) notes that member states have incorporated all post-Fukushima lessons into design codes, emergency planning and stress-test regimes, and that 2023 again recorded “high levels of safety at operating reactors worldwide.” There were zero radiation injuries at any power plant [2].  
   •  Ageing units undergo periodic safety reviews; life-extension is permitted only after equipment such as steam generators, control rod drives and digital instrumentation are upgraded to modern standards.

4.  Remaining risks and how they are managed  
   •  Severe accident probability is low but not zero; hence multi-layered (“defence-in-depth”) regulation, independent oversight (e.g., U.S. NRC, France’s ASN) and international peer reviews are mandatory [5].  
   •  Spent fuel: volumes are small (≈3 m³ per GW-year) and stored safely in pools or dry casks; Finland’s deep-geological repository, licensed in 2021, shows a commercially proven long-term solution.  
   •  Security and proliferation: plants are hardened against aircraft impact and cyber-attack; IAEA safeguards account for all fissile material.  
   •  Emergency response: real-time dose monitoring, pre-positioned iodine tablets, and zoned evacuation planning aim to minimise avoidable relocation.

5.  Overall assessment  
   •  When judged by the empirical record—fatalities per unit of electricity, frequency of severe accidents and radiological health effects—nuclear power is one of the safest large-scale energy technologies available today.  
   •  Safety is not automatic; it depends on rigorous regulation, continuous learning and investment in new designs and qualified staff.  Where these conditions are met, the probability of major harm is demonstrably very low, and the climate and air-quality benefits are large.  

Conclusion: Nuclear power is not risk-free, but decades of data show that, with modern technology and strong oversight, it is a comparatively safe way to generate reliable, low-carbon electricity.
