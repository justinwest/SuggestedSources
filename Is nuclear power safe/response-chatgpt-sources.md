# Is nuclear power safe?

Is nuclear power safe? – A multidisciplinary answer

1. What “safety” means  
   Safety can be judged by:  
   • Routine public-health impacts (air pollution, radiation exposure).  
   • Rare severe accidents.  
   • Long-term environmental and security risks (waste, sabotage, proliferation).  
   No energy technology scores perfectly on all three, so the question is relative: How does nuclear compare with the alternatives, and can its residual risks be managed acceptably?

2. How often does nuclear power kill people?  
   Large statistical studies that include the three major civilian accidents (Three Mile Island 1979, Chernobyl 1986, Fukushima 2011) find that nuclear causes far fewer deaths per unit of electricity than fossil fuels and is comparable with, or better than, most renewables:

   Average deaths per terawatt-hour of electricity (direct + modelled long-term cancer deaths)  
   • Coal (global average): 24.6  
   • Oil: 18.4  
   • Gas: 2.8  
   • Biomass: 4.6  
   • Wind: 0.04  
   • Solar PV: 0.02  
   • Nuclear: 0.03 [1], [2]

   Fossil-fuel air pollution kills an estimated 5–7 million people every year, whereas the combined immediate death toll from all civilian nuclear accidents is under 100, with several thousand additional statistical cancer fatalities projected mainly from Chernobyl [5].

3. Accident record and lessons learned  
   • Three Mile Island: no measurable health impact; catalysed stronger safety culture.  
   • Chernobyl: 31 acute deaths; WHO/UNSCEAR project ‑4000 eventual cancer deaths among the highest-exposed population; deficiencies were design- and culture-specific.  
   • Fukushima: no acute radiation deaths; UNSCEAR expects no discernible increase in cancer; evacuation trauma caused more than 1,000 indirect deaths [5].

   Since Fukushima, all operating and new reactors have undergone “stress tests” and back-fits for flood, seismic, and blackout scenarios; passive-safety Gen-III/III+ designs dominate new construction [3].

4. Present-day operational safety  
   • The world’s 440 power reactors logged more than 3,600 reactor-years of operation in 2014-23 with no severe core-damage accidents [3].  
   • Plants are among the most heavily regulated industrial facilities; probabilistic risk assessments carried out by Sandia National Laboratories put the average chance of a core-damage event at ~10⁻⁵ per reactor-year for modern designs, orders of magnitude below early plants [4].  
   • Reactor and spent-fuel worker doses have fallen steadily and are well below the ICRP 20 mSv/yr occupational limit [3].

5. Remaining and emerging risks  
   • Waste: Geological repositories (e.g., Finland’s Onkalo) show that long-term isolation is technically feasible, but public acceptance and delayed implementation remain challenges.  
   • Ageing fleet: most reactors are >30 years old; life-extension programmes require rigorous component replacement and updated safety analysis [3].  
   • Climate change hazards: higher river temperatures, storm surges and wildfires can stress cooling systems; designers are now required to consider beyond-design-basis natural events [3].  
   • Security and proliferation: civil power reactors are not suitable for rapid weapons production, but strong safeguards and physical protection remain necessary.

6. Comparative perspective  
   • No energy source is risk-free, but, measured by fatalities, disease burden and greenhouse-gas emissions, nuclear is among the safest and cleanest options available today [1], [2].  
   • Because accidents, when they do occur, can produce large economic losses and psychological trauma, safety depends on continuous regulatory vigilance, transparency and learning.  
   • Modern reactor types (e.g., small modular reactors with passive shutdown, molten-salt and high-temperature gas designs) aim to reduce both accident probability and consequences further.

7. Bottom line  
   Statistically and technologically, commercial nuclear power is one of the safest ways to generate large amounts of low-carbon electricity. Its residual risks—while not negligible—are well characterized, declining with newer designs, and can be managed through strict regulation, robust safety culture and international oversight. Whether society deems that level of risk “safe enough” ultimately blends engineering evidence with political and ethical judgement.
