# Is nuclear power safe?

The short answer is “yes, but….”  
Across most measurable dimensions—fatalities, routine health effects, and environmental impact—civil nuclear power is among the safest ways we have to generate large amounts of electricity.  It is not risk-free, and it demands strong regulation and constant vigilance, but the evidence shows that its overall risk is lower than that of virtually every fossil-fuel alternative and comparable to, or better than, most renewables.

1. How nuclear compares with other energy sources  
   • A comprehensive study of historical accidents and air-pollution deaths puts the median fatality rate of nuclear power at about 0.03 deaths per terawatt-hour (TWh) of electricity.  Coal is roughly 25 deaths/TWh, oil 18, gas 2.8, solar 0.02, and wind 0.04 [1].  
   • The Economist’s 2022 analysis, using a wider range of datasets, reached the same conclusion: even when the 1986 Chernobyl disaster is included, nuclear’s death rate remains far lower than that of fossil fuels [3].  

2. What the historical accident record shows  
   • Since civil nuclear power began in the 1950s, three accidents have reached International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES) level 4 or higher: Three Mile Island (1979, no radiation deaths), Chernobyl (1986, 28 acute fatalities and several thousand potential long-term cancer deaths), and Fukushima Daiichi (2011, zero radiation deaths to date) [2].  
   • For context, the World Health Organization attributes roughly 3.6 million premature deaths per year to outdoor air pollution, much of it from burning coal and oil—an ongoing toll far exceeding that of nuclear accidents.  

3. Current safety performance  
   • The International Atomic Energy Agency’s 2024 Nuclear Safety Review reports no Level-4 or higher accidents worldwide in the past decade, a downward trend in significant events, and continued strengthening of plant defenses against natural hazards and cyber-threats [2].  
   • Research programmes such as Sandia National Laboratories’ risk assessments, severe-accident modeling, and materials testing underpin these improvements and feed into updated regulatory requirements [4].  

4. Why nuclear’s statistical risk is low  
   • Defense-in-depth: multiple, redundant systems for cooling, containment, and shutdown reduce the chance that any single failure will escalate.  
   • Passive safety and newer designs: Gen III+ reactors (e.g., AP-1000, EPR) incorporate passive cooling that works without power or human intervention, dramatically cutting core-damage frequency. Small Modular Reactors and advanced concepts (molten salt, high-temperature gas) aim to push risks even lower.  
   • International peer review: IAEA Safety Standards, Operational Safety Review Teams (OSART), and regional regulators share operating experience and enforce continuous improvement.  

5. Remaining concerns and caveats  
   • Low-probability, high-consequence accidents remain possible, especially in older plants or where safety culture is weak.  
   • Nuclear waste must be isolated for millennia, though volumes are small and well-controlled; long-term geological repositories (e.g., Finland’s Onkalo) are coming online.  
   • Security and proliferation risks require separate safeguards.  
   • Public trust can erode quickly after any incident, so transparency and rigorous oversight are essential.  

Conclusion  
When judged by empirical data rather than perception, nuclear power is one of the safest large-scale energy technologies available.  The principal condition is stringent, properly enforced safety standards—and those standards must evolve as technology and external threats change.  With such governance in place, nuclear energy can play a significant role in decarbonizing the power sector without imposing undue risk on workers or the public.
