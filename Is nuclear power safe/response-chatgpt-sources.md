Is Nuclear Power Safe?  

1.  How safety is measured  
   •  The usual yardstick is the number of deaths (from accidents and the air pollution the plant causes while operating) per unit of electricity produced. This allows a like-for-like comparison with other energy sources.  

2.  What the numbers say  
   •  Over the period covered by the data, nuclear energy has caused about 0.07 deaths per terawatt-hour (TWh) of electricity. Coal causes roughly 25 deaths/TWh, oil 18, natural gas about 3 and hydropower 1.3. Wind and solar are lower still, but nuclear is already more than 300 times safer than coal on this metric [1].  
   •  Even when the two major accidents (Chernobyl 1986 and Fukushima 2011) are included, nuclear’s cumulative death toll remains small compared with the routine air-pollution deaths attributed to fossil fuels [1].  

3.  How the industry tries to keep it that way  
   •  All countries that operate reactors are committed to a framework of “continuous improvement” built around the IAEA Safety Standards, peer reviews (e.g., OSART, IRRS) and mandatory post-Fukushima stress tests. The IAEA notes that “nuclear safety remains an international priority” and that Member States have introduced “additional design features, enhanced severe-accident management and strengthened emergency preparedness” since 2011 [2].  
   •  Reactor technology itself has evolved. Modern “Generation III+” plants include passive safety systems that can keep the core cooled for days without outside power or operator action—an explicit response to lessons from Fukushima [2].  

4.  Residual risks and concerns  
   •  Large accidents, while rare, can have far-reaching social and economic consequences (e.g., long-term evacuation zones).  
   •  Long-lived radioactive waste requires secure management over centuries, although volumes are small compared with other hazardous industrial wastes [2].  
   •  Public perception is strongly influenced by high-profile accidents, so risk communication and safety culture remain critical.  

5.  Bottom line  
   •  On a statistical basis nuclear power is one of the safest large-scale sources of electricity available today. It is not risk-free, but the absolute risk to life and health is low compared with the routine harm caused by fossil-fuelled power production. The continuing international safety regime led by the IAEA, together with newer reactor designs, aims to keep those risks as low as reasonably achievable.

[1] Our World in Data – “What are the safest sources of energy?” (https://ourworldindata.org/safest-sources-of-energy). Authors compile historical accident records and pollution studies and conclude that nuclear has orders-of-magnitude lower mortality per unit of electricity than fossil fuels, even when Chernobyl and Fukushima are included.  

[2] International Atomic Energy Agency – “Nuclear Safety Review 2024” (GC/68/INF/2) (https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/gc/gc68-inf2.pdf). The IAEA underscores that Member States regard safety as their highest priority, describes the post-Fukushima upgrades and the role of IAEA safety standards, and states that the global nuclear fleet continues to operate with a strong overall safety record.
