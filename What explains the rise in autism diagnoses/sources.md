* Here are ten peer‑reviewed or authoritative sources that researchers often cite when discussing why autism diagnoses have risen. Each one offers a distinctive line of evidence (diagnostic change, awareness/screening, environmental or demographic risks, etc.):

* **Hansen SN et al., 2015 – “Explaining the increase in the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders: the proportion attributable to changes in reporting practices.”**
  Danish national‑registry analysis showing that a 1994 criteria update plus adding outpatient data explained ≈60 % of the recorded rise in ASD among 1980‑1991 birth cohorts. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][1])

* **King M & Bearman P, 2009 – “Diagnostic change and the increased prevalence of autism.”**
  Case‑record study of California service files estimating that diagnostic substitution from intellectual disability to ASD accounted for ≈26 % of the state’s surge between 1992‑2005. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][2])

* **Taylor MJ et al., 2020 – “Etiology of Autism Spectrum Disorders and Autistic Traits Over Time.”**
  Large Swedish twin cohorts show the genetic‑to‑environmental balance behind autistic traits remained stable from the 1980s to 2000s, implying the prevalence jump stems largely from identification, not new etiologic forces. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][3])

* **CDC ADDM Network, 2025 – “Data and Statistics on Autism Spectrum Disorder.”**
  The latest U.S. surveillance update reporting prevalence has reached 1 in 31 (3.2 %) for 8‑year‑olds—an essential baseline for all trend discussions. ([cdc.gov][4])

* **Modabbernia A et al., 2017 – “Environmental risk factors for autism: an evidence‑based review of systematic reviews and meta‑analyses.”**
  Comprehensive umbrella review concluding that, while some prenatal/perinatal exposures carry modest risk, no single environmental factor explains the multi‑fold rise. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][5])

* **Reichenberg A et al., 2006 – “Advancing paternal age and autism.”**
  Israeli birth‑cohort study finding a five‑to‑six‑fold higher ASD risk in children of fathers ≥ 40, illuminating how demographic shifts (older parenthood) can add to incidence. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][6])

* **Agrawal S et al., 2018 – “Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Preterm Infants: A Meta‑analysis.”**
  Meta‑analysis of 3,366 very‑preterm survivors estimating a 7 % ASD prevalence—evidence that improved neonatal survival modestly augments case counts. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][7])

* **Croen LA et al., 2002 – “The changing prevalence of autism in California.”**
  Early population study linking falling intellectual‑disability rates and rising ASD diagnoses, suggesting improved detection rather than a biologic epidemic. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][8])

* **Sandin S et al., 2012 – “Advancing maternal age is associated with increasing risk for autism: a review and meta‑analysis.”**
  Pooled data on >25,000 ASD cases confirm a monotonic risk increase with maternal age, quantifying how this demographic factor may contribute a small share of the trend. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][9])

* **King BH et al., 2014 – “Update on diagnostic classification in autism.”**
  Narrative review detailing why DSM‑5 collapsed prior sub‑diagnoses into a single ASD category and how such definitional shifts reshape prevalence statistics. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][10])
