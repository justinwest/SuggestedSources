# What explains the rise in autism diagnoses?

The rise in autism diagnoses over the past several decades is primarily explained by a combination of expanded definitions, improved awareness, and better diagnostic practices rather than an actual increase in the underlying prevalence of autism itself.

## Expanded Diagnostic Criteria

The most significant factor is the broadening of diagnostic criteria. The autism spectrum has expanded considerably since the 1940s when autism was first described. The DSM-5 (2013) consolidated several previously separate conditions—including Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified—under the single umbrella of "autism spectrum disorder." This change alone captured many individuals who previously would have received different diagnoses or no diagnosis at all.

## Increased Awareness and Recognition

Healthcare professionals, educators, and parents are now much more aware of autism's varied presentations. This increased awareness has led to:

- Earlier identification of symptoms
- Recognition of autism in girls and women, who often present differently than males
- Better identification of autism in individuals with average or above-average intelligence
- Recognition of autism in adults who were missed as children

## Improved Diagnostic Tools and Training

The development of standardized diagnostic instruments and better training for healthcare providers has significantly improved diagnostic accuracy. Mental health professionals, pediatricians, and other clinicians are now better equipped to recognize the subtle signs of autism across the spectrum.

## Reduced Stigma and Increased Services

As stigma around autism has decreased and support services have increased, more families are seeking evaluations. The availability of educational supports and interventions has created incentives for obtaining a diagnosis that didn't exist in previous decades.

## Diagnostic Substitution

Research suggests that some of the increase represents diagnostic substitution—individuals who might have previously been diagnosed with intellectual disability, language disorders, or other conditions are now more accurately identified as having autism.

## What the Evidence Shows

Multiple large-scale studies have found that when researchers apply current diagnostic criteria to historical populations, autism rates remain relatively stable. This suggests that autism has always existed at similar rates, but was simply unrecognized or misdiagnosed in the past.

The scientific consensus does not support the idea that environmental factors are causing a true epidemic of autism, though research into potential contributing factors continues. The apparent "rise" in autism is largely a story of improved recognition of a condition that has always been present in human populations.
