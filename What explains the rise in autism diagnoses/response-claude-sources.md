# What explains the rise in autism diagnoses?

The rise in autism diagnoses over the past several decades is explained by multiple interconnected factors, with research indicating that changes in diagnostic practices and awareness account for the majority of the increase, though some genuine increase in prevalence may also be occurring.

## Diagnostic and Reporting Changes

The most significant factor explaining the rise in autism diagnoses is changes in diagnostic criteria and reporting practices. Research published in JAMA Pediatrics found that changes in reporting practices alone could account for a substantial proportion of the observed increase in autism spectrum disorder prevalence [4]. The diagnostic criteria for autism have expanded considerably over time, with the creation of the broader "autism spectrum disorder" category that now includes conditions previously diagnosed separately, such as Asperger's syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified [5][13].

Studies examining diagnostic changes have consistently found that broadened criteria and improved recognition of autism symptoms, particularly in higher-functioning individuals, have dramatically increased the number of people receiving autism diagnoses [5]. This expansion means that many individuals who would not have been diagnosed with autism in earlier decades now receive an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis.

## Increased Awareness and Recognition

Enhanced awareness among healthcare providers, educators, and parents has led to better identification of autism symptoms, particularly in girls and individuals with less severe presentations who were historically underdiagnosed. This improved recognition has contributed significantly to the apparent increase in prevalence [4][7].

## Demographic and Environmental Risk Factors

Several demographic trends may contribute to a genuine increase in autism prevalence:

**Parental Age**: Research has established clear associations between advancing parental age and increased autism risk. Studies show that both advancing maternal age [12] and advancing paternal age [9] are associated with higher rates of autism diagnoses. As parents increasingly delay childbearing, this demographic shift may contribute to rising autism rates.

**Preterm Birth**: Meta-analyses have found increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorder among preterm infants [10]. Improvements in neonatal care that increase survival rates of very premature infants may contribute to higher overall autism prevalence.

**Other Environmental Factors**: Systematic reviews of environmental risk factors have identified various prenatal and perinatal factors that may influence autism risk, though the evidence for specific environmental causes remains mixed [8].

## Genetic Factors

Twin studies indicate that autism spectrum disorders are highly heritable, with heritability estimates typically ranging from 70-90% [3]. However, while genetic factors explain individual susceptibility to autism, they do not directly explain the rapid increase in diagnoses over a relatively short time period, as the gene pool does not change that quickly. Research on the etiology of autism traits over time suggests that genetic factors remain the primary contributor to autism risk, but environmental factors may also play a role [6].

## Data and Surveillance Improvements

Enhanced surveillance systems and data collection methods have improved the identification and tracking of autism cases. The CDC's monitoring systems have become more comprehensive and systematic over time, leading to better case identification [7].

## Conclusion

The preponderance of evidence suggests that the majority of the increase in autism diagnoses can be attributed to diagnostic changes, expanded criteria, and improved awareness and recognition, rather than a true epidemic of new cases. However, some genuine increase in prevalence may be occurring due to demographic changes such as increasing parental age and improved survival of high-risk infants. The combination of these factors creates a complex picture where both artificial increases (due to better recognition) and some genuine increases (due to changing risk factors) likely contribute to the observed trends.
