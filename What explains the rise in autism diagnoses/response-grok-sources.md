# What explains the rise in autism diagnoses?

The rise in autism diagnoses over recent decades is a complex phenomenon that has sparked significant debate among researchers, clinicians, and the public. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) prevalence has increased dramatically, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reporting a rise from 1 in 150 children in 2000 to 1 in 36 children in 2020 in the United States [1]. This increase has led to various explanations, ranging from changes in diagnostic practices and awareness to potential environmental and genetic factors. Below, I explore the primary factors contributing to the rise in autism diagnoses, drawing on the provided sources and additional research for a comprehensive understanding.

One of the most widely supported explanations for the increase in autism diagnoses is the evolution of diagnostic criteria and reporting practices. Over the years, the definition of autism has broadened significantly. The introduction of the term "Autism Spectrum Disorder" in the DSM-5 (2013) combined previously separate diagnoses, such as Asperger’s syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), into a single category, capturing a wider range of behaviors and severities [2]. Studies, such as one published in *JAMA Pediatrics*, estimate that changes in diagnostic and reporting practices account for a substantial proportion—potentially up to 60%—of the observed increase in prevalence [3]. Similarly, research in the *International Journal of Epidemiology* highlights how diagnostic substitution, where children previously diagnosed with other conditions like intellectual disability are now classified under ASD, contributes to higher reported rates [4]. Increased awareness among parents, educators, and healthcare providers has also led to more children being screened and identified, even in milder cases that might have gone undiagnosed in the past [5].

Beyond diagnostic changes, there is evidence suggesting that some of the rise may be linked to environmental and demographic factors. Research published in *Molecular Autism* reviews environmental risk factors, such as exposure to air pollution, pesticides, and maternal stress during pregnancy, which may play a role in the development of ASD, though the evidence is not conclusive and often confounded by other variables [6]. Additionally, studies in *Archives of General Psychiatry* and the *Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry* have identified advancing parental age—both maternal and paternal—as a risk factor for autism, with older parents being associated with a higher likelihood of having a child with ASD [7][8]. This trend aligns with societal shifts toward delayed parenthood in many developed countries. Preterm birth is another risk factor, as noted in a meta-analysis in *Pediatrics*, which found a higher prevalence of ASD among preterm infants [9]. While these factors contribute to the rise, they do not fully explain the exponential increase in diagnoses.

Genetic factors also play a significant role in autism, though they are less directly tied to the rise in prevalence. A meta-analysis of twin studies in the *Journal of Child Psychology & Psychiatry* estimates that autism has a high heritability, ranging from 64% to 91%, indicating a strong genetic component [10]. However, as noted in *JAMA Psychiatry*, the genetic etiology of autism has remained relatively stable over time, suggesting that genetics alone cannot account for the rapid increase in diagnoses [11]. Instead, the interplay between genetic predispositions and environmental triggers is an area of ongoing research.

Some sources, such as the blog post from the *National Council on Severe Autism*, argue that the rise in autism diagnoses reflects a genuine increase in the condition, beyond just diagnostic changes, pointing to the growing number of individuals with severe autism who require significant support [12]. This perspective contrasts with more skeptical views, such as those expressed in Arnold Kling’s Substack post, which critiques claims (like those of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.) linking autism to environmental toxins or vaccines, emphasizing that such theories lack robust scientific evidence [13]. Similarly, a post on Cremieux’s blog questions whether the rise is entirely due to diagnostic inflation, suggesting that while awareness and criteria changes are major factors, other influences cannot be entirely ruled out [14].

In conclusion, the rise in autism diagnoses is most convincingly explained by changes in diagnostic criteria, increased awareness, and improved identification practices, which have collectively broadened the pool of individuals recognized as being on the autism spectrum. While environmental factors like parental age and preterm birth, as well as genetic predispositions, contribute to the prevalence of ASD, they do not fully account for the dramatic increase observed over recent decades. Ongoing research is needed to disentangle the relative contributions of these factors and to address public concerns about potential environmental risks, ensuring that explanations remain grounded in scientific evidence.
