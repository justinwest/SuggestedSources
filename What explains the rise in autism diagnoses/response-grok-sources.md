### What Explains the Rise in Autism Diagnoses?

The rise in autism diagnoses over recent decades has sparked significant debate and research, with explanations ranging from environmental factors to changes in diagnostic practices and genetic influences. Drawing from the provided sources, this response explores the key factors contributing to the increase in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnoses, including improved awareness and diagnostic criteria, potential environmental influences, and the role of genetic heritability.

#### 1. Improved Awareness and Broader Diagnostic Criteria
One of the most widely accepted explanations for the rise in autism diagnoses is the improvement in awareness and the expansion of diagnostic criteria. Over the past few decades, there has been a significant increase in public and professional understanding of autism, leading to more children being identified and diagnosed. The National Council on Severe Autism (NCSA) highlights that changes in diagnostic practices, including the broadening of criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), have contributed to higher reported prevalence rates. For instance, earlier definitions of autism were narrower, focusing on more severe cases, whereas current criteria encompass a wider spectrum of behaviors and severities, including milder forms like Asperger's syndrome (NCSA, 2024).

Additionally, increased screening and early intervention programs have played a role. Parents, educators, and healthcare providers are now more likely to recognize signs of autism and seek evaluations, resulting in higher diagnosis rates. Arnold Kling, in his commentary, also notes that the rise may partly reflect a "labeling effect," where behaviors previously attributed to other conditions or not diagnosed at all are now classified under the autism spectrum (Kling, 2025).

#### 2. Potential Environmental Influences
Another factor often discussed in relation to the rise in autism diagnoses is the potential role of environmental influences. While the evidence is not conclusive, some sources suggest that exposure to certain environmental factors during pregnancy or early childhood might contribute to the development of autism. Kling's commentary references Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s claims about environmental toxins, such as vaccines or pollutants, as possible contributors to autism rates. However, Kling remains skeptical of these claims, pointing out that scientific consensus does not support a causal link between vaccines and autism (Kling, 2025). The NCSA also acknowledges that while environmental factors are an area of active research, the data does not yet provide definitive answers about their impact on autism prevalence (NCSA, 2024).

#### 3. Genetic Heritability and Population Changes
Genetics plays a significant role in autism, and research into heritability provides insight into why autism diagnoses may be increasing. A meta-analysis of twin studies published in the *Journal of Child Psychology & Psychiatry* found that autism has a high heritability rate, estimated at around 64-91%, indicating that genetic factors are a major contributor to the likelihood of developing ASD (Tick et al., 2016). This suggests that a substantial portion of autism cases can be attributed to inherited genetic variations.

However, genetic factors alone do not fully explain the rise in diagnoses. The NCSA points out that while genetic predisposition is critical, the rapid increase in autism prevalence over a short period cannot be solely due to changes in the gene pool, as genetic shifts occur over much longer timescales. Instead, it is likely that the interaction between genetic vulnerabilities and environmental or societal changes (such as increased awareness or diagnostic practices) contributes to the observed trends (NCSA, 2024).

#### 4. Societal and Cultural Factors
Beyond clinical and scientific explanations, societal and cultural factors also influence autism diagnosis rates. Kling suggests that the rise in diagnoses may be tied to a cultural shift where parents and professionals are more willing to seek and accept an autism diagnosis due to reduced stigma and increased access to support services (Kling, 2025). This aligns with the NCSA's observation that the availability of educational and therapeutic resources for individuals with autism has incentivized early diagnosis, as families seek to access these benefits (NCSA, 2024).

#### Conclusion
The rise in autism diagnoses is a multifaceted phenomenon that cannot be attributed to a single cause. Improved awareness, broader diagnostic criteria, and better screening practices have significantly increased the identification of individuals on the autism spectrum. While genetic heritability plays a crucial role in the likelihood of developing autism, it does not fully account for the rapid rise in prevalence, suggesting that environmental, societal, and cultural factors also contribute. Although environmental influences remain a topic of debate and research, there is no conclusive evidence linking specific factors like vaccines to autism. Together, these elements provide a comprehensive explanation for the observed increase in autism diagnoses over recent decades.
