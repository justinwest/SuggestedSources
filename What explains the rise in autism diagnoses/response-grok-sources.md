# What explains the rise in autism diagnoses?

### What Explains the Rise in Autism Diagnoses?

The rise in autism diagnoses over recent decades has been a topic of significant research and debate. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) prevalence has increased dramatically, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reporting a rise from 1 in 150 children in 2000 to 1 in 36 children in 2020 in the United States [1]. This increase has prompted investigations into whether it reflects a true rise in incidence, changes in diagnostic practices, or a combination of factors. Below, I explore the primary explanations for this trend, drawing on genetic, environmental, and societal factors as well as shifts in diagnostic criteria and awareness.

#### 1. Changes in Diagnostic Criteria and Reporting Practices
One of the most widely supported explanations for the rise in autism diagnoses is the evolution of diagnostic criteria and improved reporting practices. Over the years, the definition of autism has broadened significantly. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) has undergone revisions, with the DSM-5 (released in 2013) combining previously separate diagnoses like Asperger’s syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder into a single category of Autism Spectrum Disorder [2]. This broader classification captures a wider range of behaviors and severities, leading to more individuals being diagnosed [3].

Additionally, studies suggest that a substantial proportion of the increase in prevalence can be attributed to changes in reporting practices. For instance, research published in *JAMA Pediatrics* found that up to 60% of the rise in autism prevalence in Denmark between 1980 and 1991 was due to changes in diagnostic reporting and the inclusion of outpatient diagnoses [4]. Similarly, a study in the *International Journal of Epidemiology* highlighted that diagnostic substitution—where children previously diagnosed with other conditions like intellectual disability are now classified as having autism—plays a significant role [5]. These findings indicate that much of the rise may not reflect an actual increase in autism cases but rather a reclassification of existing conditions.

#### 2. Increased Awareness and Access to Services
Heightened public and professional awareness of autism has also contributed to the rise in diagnoses. Over the past few decades, advocacy efforts, media coverage, and educational campaigns have made parents, teachers, and healthcare providers more attuned to the signs of autism, leading to earlier and more frequent identification [6]. The CDC notes that improved screening tools and access to diagnostic services, particularly in underserved communities, have resulted in more children being evaluated and diagnosed [1].

Moreover, the availability of support services tied to an autism diagnosis, such as special education programs and therapies, incentivizes families to seek formal evaluations. This phenomenon, sometimes referred to as “diagnostic seeking,” has been documented in studies like *The Changing Prevalence of Autism in California*, which observed spikes in diagnoses correlating with policy changes that expanded access to services [7].

#### 3. Genetic Factors and Heritability
While changes in diagnosis and awareness explain much of the rise, genetic factors remain a critical component of autism’s etiology. Twin studies, such as a meta-analysis published in the *Journal of Child Psychology & Psychiatry*, estimate that autism has a heritability rate of 64-91%, indicating a strong genetic basis [8]. However, genetic factors alone do not account for the rapid increase in diagnoses, as genetic changes in populations occur over much longer timescales. Instead, researchers suggest that the interaction between genetic predispositions and environmental factors may play a role in the expression of autistic traits over time [9].

#### 4. Environmental and Demographic Risk Factors
Environmental and demographic factors have also been explored as potential contributors to the rise in autism diagnoses. Studies have identified associations between autism risk and advanced parental age, both maternal and paternal. Research in the *Archives of General Psychiatry* found that children born to fathers over 40 had a significantly higher risk of autism compared to those with younger fathers [10]. Similarly, a meta-analysis in the *Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry* confirmed an increased risk with advancing maternal age [11]. As societal trends shift toward later parenthood, these factors may contribute to a small but measurable increase in autism prevalence.

Other environmental factors, such as preterm birth, have also been linked to higher autism rates. A meta-analysis in *Pediatrics* reported that preterm infants are at a significantly greater risk of developing ASD compared to full-term infants [12]. Additionally, while controversial and often overstated, some studies have examined environmental exposures like air pollution or prenatal stressors, though evidence remains inconclusive according to a review in *Molecular Autism* [13].

#### 5. Debates and Misconceptions
Despite the scientific consensus leaning toward diagnostic and societal changes as primary drivers, alternative theories persist, often fueled by public figures or advocacy groups. For instance, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has controversially linked autism to vaccines, a claim repeatedly debunked by extensive research but still influential in some circles [14]. The *National Council on Severe Autism* also raises concerns about whether environmental toxins or other modern factors are contributing to a “real” increase, though they acknowledge the role of diagnostic expansion [15]. These perspectives highlight the tension between scientific evidence and public perception, underscoring the need for continued education on autism’s causes.

#### Conclusion
The rise in autism diagnoses is best explained by a combination of factors, with changes in diagnostic criteria, increased awareness, and improved access to services playing the most significant roles. While genetic predisposition remains a foundational element of autism, it does not account for the rapid increase in prevalence. Environmental and demographic factors, such as advanced parental age and preterm birth, may contribute modestly to a true rise in incidence, but the evidence suggests that much of the observed increase is due to better identification and reclassification of cases. Addressing misconceptions and focusing on evidence-based research will be crucial to understanding and supporting individuals with autism in the future.
