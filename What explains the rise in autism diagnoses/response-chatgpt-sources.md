# What explains the rise in autism diagnoses?

The explosion in reported autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cases is real in administrative data, but the evidence shows that most of the rise is an artefact of how, when and to whom the diagnosis is applied, rather than the sudden appearance of a new epidemic.

1. Broader and shifting diagnostic criteria  
   • 1980-2022 the DSM moved from one narrow definition (“infantile autism,” DSM-III) to the much broader “autism spectrum disorder” (DSM-5). This enlarged the pool to include very-high-IQ children with social-communication problems as well as toddlers who would once have been called “developmentally delayed.” [13]  
   • A California birth-cohort analysis showed that when pre-1994 criteria are applied to later cohorts, prevalence is almost unchanged, implying that diagnostic change explains the bulk of the rise. [5]

2. Greater awareness, screening and services (“ascertainment”)  
   • Paediatricians now screen at 18- and 24-month well-baby visits; parents and teachers are far more familiar with ASD warning signs; schools have an incentive to identify children so they can obtain special-education funds. Together these practices account for roughly 30-40 % of the observed increase. [4], [7]  
   • The median age at first diagnosis has fallen by ~3 years since the 1990s, so the same child is counted in more surveillance years, further inflating prevalence statistics. [4]

3. Diagnostic substitution  
   • Children who in the 1980s would have been labelled “intellectual disability,” “language disorder,” or “emotional disturbance” are now coded as ASD. As many as one-third of new autism cases come from such relabelling. [5]

4. Demographic and obstetric shifts that modestly raise true risk  
   • Advanced parental age (especially fathers > 40) is associated with a 1.3- to 1.6-fold higher risk of ASD, probably through new (“de-novo”) genetic mutations. Parental age has risen steadily since 1980 and may explain 4-12 % of the secular trend. [9], [12]  
   • Very-preterm birth, now far more survivable, carries a two- to three-fold ASD risk. Improved neonatal care therefore adds some genuinely affected children to the population. [10]  

5. Genetics remain the main causal substrate  
   • Meta-analyses of twin studies show heritability ≈ 80 %; that figure has not changed over time, indicating that genes still dominate liability even though diagnosis is applied more often. [3], [6]  

6. Environmental factors are studied but appear small or unreplicated  
   • Systematic reviews find modest evidence for a few prenatal exposures (valproate, heavy air pollution), but no credible link to vaccines. Collectively these factors are too weak and too rare to generate the multi-fold increase seen in surveillance data. [8], [1]

Putting the pieces together  
The most comprehensive decomposition to date (JAMA Pediatrics, 2014) attributed roughly 60 % of the prevalence rise to diagnostic change/ascertainment, 16 % to younger age at diagnosis, and the remainder to true increases plausibly driven by demographic shifts and small environmental risks. [4] Subsequent work using Scandinavian registries reaches a similar conclusion: the underlying liability distribution looks stable once measurement issues are controlled. [6]

In short, autism is diagnosed more often today largely because clinicians are looking harder, looking earlier, and using a wider net—not because the basic biology of children has radically changed.
