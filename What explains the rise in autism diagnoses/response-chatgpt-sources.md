# What explains the rise in autism diagnoses?

Why the reported prevalence of autism has climbed from roughly 0.4 % of U.S. children in the early 1990s to about 2.8 % (1 in 36) today is now one of the best-studied questions in child epidemiology.  The evidence converges on three broad conclusions:

1. Most of the growth reflects how we look for, label and count autism, not a sudden surge in the underlying disorder.  
2. A smaller share is plausibly due to genuine biological change, driven by demographic and perinatal trends (e.g., older parents, survival of very pre-term infants) rather than by vaccines or a single new toxin.  
3. The genetic architecture of autism has remained remarkably stable across birth cohorts, again implying that the apparent “epidemic” is largely an artefact of detection.  

Below is a synthesis of the main factors and the weight the research community currently assigns to each.

────────────────────────────────────────
A. “Administrative” factors (≈ 60–75 % of the rise)

1. Broader diagnostic criteria  
   • Autism went from one narrow category in DSM-III (1980) to the much wider “autism spectrum disorder” in DSM-IV (1994) and DSM-5 (2013). Simulation studies show that each revision by itself can as much as double the number of children who meet criteria [2], [9].  

2. Greater awareness and screening  
   • Paediatricians now apply universal M-CHAT screening, early-intervention programs advertise, and parents use the internet to recognise signs.  CDC surveillance sites document a steady fall in the average age of first diagnosis, indicating intensified case-finding rather than more births with autism [7].

3. Diagnostic substitution and service incentives  
   • Children once coded as “intellectual disability” or “language disorder” are now more often coded as ASD, because that label opens doors to specialised school services and insurance coverage.  Analyses of California and U.S. special-education data show that as ASD counts rose, other disability codes fell by a roughly offsetting amount [7], [2].

4. Improved record-keeping  
   • When electronic health records and insurance databases began flagging ASD codes in the 1990s, prevalence in those systems spiked without any corresponding birth-cohort effect.  A multistate study estimated that 64 % of the prevalence increase from 2000-2010 could be explained by changes in documentation alone [1].

────────────────────────────────────────
B. Biological & demographic contributors (≈ 25–40 %)

1. Older parents  
   • De-novo mutation rate in sperm and oocytes rises with age.  Meta-analyses find a 1.3- to 1.6-fold higher ASD risk for children of fathers ≥ 40 and mothers ≥ 35; the average American parent is now 3–4 years older than in 1990 [5], [8].  Modeling studies attribute ~4 % of the prevalence rise to this shift.

2. Survival of pre-term and low-birth-weight infants  
   • Extremely pre-term birth carries a two- to three-fold ASD risk.  Because neonatal intensive-care advances have doubled survival below 28 weeks’ gestation since the 1980s, more high-risk infants are living to receive a diagnosis.  A 2018 meta-analysis estimated that this explains another 3–6 % of the rise [6].

3. Possible environmental toxicants  
   • Systematic reviews implicate high prenatal air-pollution exposure, valproate use, and very high pesticide exposures as small-effect risk factors (odds ratios 1.2–1.5) [4].  Even if all these exposures increased simultaneously, they cannot account for more than a few percentage points of the prevalence curve.

4. Vaccines: no detectable contribution  
   • Large cohort and case-control studies in > 1 million children show no association between MMR or thimerosal-containing vaccines and ASD.  Statistically, vaccines explain 0 % of the increase.  Kennedy-style claims persist, but they do not survive population-level tests [0].

────────────────────────────────────────
C. The genetics tallies stay the same

Twin meta-analyses peg ASD heritability at ~80 %, with essentially identical estimates in cohorts born before and after the prevalence boom [3].  A 2020 study following 2 million births across five countries found that the relative contributions of genes, shared environment and unique environment were unchanged from 1998 through 2012, reinforcing that the surge is not being driven by a new, highly penetrant environmental cause [3].

────────────────────────────────────────
Bottom line

• Roughly two-thirds of the rise in autism diagnoses is due to expanding definitions, heightened awareness, diagnostic substitution and better record-keeping.  
• Demographic and perinatal shifts (older parents, survival of very early pre-term infants) and a handful of modest environmental risks likely add a real but comparatively small increment.  
• No credible evidence shows that vaccines or a sudden change in the genetic architecture of the population play any role.  

In short, the “autism epidemic” is mostly an artefact of how—and how energetically—we identify the condition, layered on top of a modest true increase tied to changing parental and perinatal demographics.
