# What explains the rise in autism diagnoses?

Most investigators now think of the “autism epidemic” as a statistical composite generated by three overlapping forces:

1. How we look for autism has changed far more than autism itself.  
2. Some underlying risk factors really have become more common.  
3. Environmental or biological insults may play a modest, still-uncertain role.

Below is the evidence for each category and the share of the observed rise that the best studies attribute to it.

--------------------------------------------------
1. Measurement and ascertainment effects (≈ 50–80 % of the rise)

• Broader diagnostic criteria  
   – The category expanded from “infantile autism” in DSM-III (1980) to a heterogeneous “autism spectrum” that in DSM-IV (1994) added Asperger’s and PDD-NOS, then was consolidated in DSM-5 (2013). Each revision lowered the symptom threshold and raised prevalence estimates [13].  
• Diagnostic substitution and re-labeling  
   – In California 1987-1994, 24 % of new ASD cases came from children who would previously have received an intellectual-disability label, and 56 % from other non-autism categories [5].  
• Better screening, more services, and greater public awareness  
   – U.S. schools, pediatricians (universal screening recommended since 2007) and insurance coverage now actively look for ASD, so milder cases that once stayed invisible are counted [1][7].  
• Changes in administrative reporting  
   – A population-based analysis of 1990–2010 birth cohorts concluded that 60 % (95 % CI, 48-71 %) of the rise was explained by changes in recording practices alone [4].

Taken together, these factors explain at least one-half and quite possibly most of the increase in diagnosed prevalence.

--------------------------------------------------
2. Demographic shifts that genuinely raise risk (≈ 10–25 %)

• Older parents  
   – Each 10-year increase in paternal age raises autism odds by ~20 %, and fathers ≥ 40 have roughly double the risk [9]. Maternal age ≥ 35 adds another 30 % relative risk [12]. Average parental ages have risen steadily since the 1980s, so age alone can account for an estimated 4-13 % of the prevalence growth [2].  
• Improved survival of high-risk births  
   – Very pre-term infants (< 32 weeks) have ASD rates around 7 % versus 1–2 % in term births; rising survival of these infants contributes a few additional percentage points [10].  
• Urbanisation, assortative mating among people with sub-clinical autistic traits, and smaller families may also incrementally increase true case numbers, but the effect sizes are small [15].

--------------------------------------------------
3. Specific environmental or biological exposures (probably < 10 %)

Comprehensive reviews find some reproducible associations (e.g., heavy prenatal valproate exposure, extreme air pollution peaks, organophosphate pesticides), but the overall evidence base is inconsistent and effect sizes are modest to moderate [8]. Large twin studies continue to show that heritability remains high (64-91 %) and has not changed across birth cohorts, implying that any new environmental causes are either weak or rare so far [3][6].

Notably, large epidemiologic studies repeatedly find no association between vaccines and autism; the idea does not survive controlled analysis and is rejected by the scientific literature [1][7].

--------------------------------------------------
Putting the pieces together

• U.S. prevalence rose from roughly 0.5 / 1 000 births in the 1960s to 28 / 1 000 (1 in 36) among 2012 births monitored by the CDC [7].  
• Aggregate studies that adjust for known diagnostic and reporting artifacts usually explain 50–80 % of that rise; demographic changes explain another 10–25 %.  
• The remaining fraction—if any—could reflect unidentified environmental factors or residual measurement error, but current data cannot cleanly separate the two.

In short, the rise in autism diagnoses is mostly a mirror of how, and how hard, we look for autism, amplified modestly by later parenthood and the survival of medically fragile infants. A large, rapid increase in biologically new autism is neither necessary nor well-supported by existing evidence.
