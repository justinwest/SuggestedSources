# What explains the rise in autism diagnoses?

The significant increase in autism diagnoses over the past several decades is a complex issue with multiple contributing factors. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports a rise in prevalence from 1 in 150 children in 2000 to 1 in 36 in 2020, research indicates this is not due to a single cause but rather a combination of non-etiological and etiological factors [7]. The primary drivers are changes in diagnostic practices and increased awareness, though a real increase in incidence due to environmental factors may also play a role [1, 4, 5].

### The Role of Diagnostic and Reporting Changes

A substantial portion of the increase in autism diagnoses can be attributed to how the condition is identified, defined, and reported. These changes do not necessarily mean more children have autism, but rather that more children are being diagnosed with it [4].

*   **Broadening Diagnostic Criteria**: The official definition of autism has expanded over time. The transition from the DSM-IV to the DSM-5 in 2013 consolidated several distinct conditions (Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified) into a single "Autism Spectrum Disorder" (ASD) [13]. This created a broader, more inclusive category that captures individuals with a wider range of traits, including those with milder presentations who might not have been diagnosed previously [5].
*   **Increased Awareness**: Greater public and professional awareness has led to earlier and more frequent screening for autism [1]. Parents, pediatricians, and educators are now more familiar with the signs of autism, resulting in more children being referred for evaluation and ultimately diagnosed [4].
*   **Diagnostic Substitution**: Many children who in the past might have received a diagnosis of "intellectual disability" or "language delay" are now being more accurately diagnosed with autism [11]. A 2015 study in *JAMA Pediatrics* found that changes in reporting practices, including diagnostic substitution, could account for approximately 60% of the observed increase in ASD prevalence between 2000 and 2010 [4]. An earlier study of autism cases in California also concluded that diagnostic substitution was a significant factor in the state's rising numbers [11].
*   **Access to Services**: An official autism diagnosis is often required to access specialized educational programs and therapeutic services. This creates a powerful incentive for parents and clinicians to seek a formal diagnosis, which may contribute to the rise in reported cases [1, 11].

### A Potential Real Increase in Incidence

While diagnostic changes are a major factor, some researchers and organizations argue they cannot explain the entire increase, particularly for severe forms of autism [2]. This perspective suggests there has also been a true rise in the number of individuals with the condition, likely driven by a combination of genetic predispositions and environmental risk factors.

*   **Genetic Heritability**: Autism is known to be highly heritable. A meta-analysis of twin studies published in the *Journal of Child Psychology & Psychiatry* estimated the heritability of ASD to be around 80%, indicating a strong genetic foundation [3]. However, the human gene pool does not change rapidly enough to explain the recent spike in prevalence on its own. Instead, it suggests a genetic vulnerability that may be triggered or exacerbated by environmental influences [6].
*   **Environmental Risk Factors**: Research has identified several environmental factors correlated with a higher risk of autism. While no single factor has been proven to cause autism, their increased prevalence in the population may contribute to a real rise in cases. A comprehensive 2017 review in *Molecular Autism* identified strong evidence for several risk factors [8], including:
    *   **Advanced Parental Age**: Both advanced maternal and paternal age at the time of conception are consistently linked to an increased risk of having a child with autism [9, 12]. The average age of parents has been rising in many industrialized nations.
    *   **Perinatal and Prenatal Factors**: Complications during pregnancy and birth, including preterm birth and low birth weight, are associated with a higher likelihood of an ASD diagnosis [10, 8].
    *   **Environmental Exposures**: Some studies have suggested links between prenatal exposure to air pollution, certain pesticides, and maternal health conditions like obesity and diabetes, though the evidence for many of these is still developing [8].

In conclusion, the rise in diagnosed autism is a multifaceted phenomenon. The most significant driver appears to be the evolution of diagnostic practices, including broader criteria, greater awareness, and diagnostic substitution, which have made the diagnosis more common and inclusive. Concurrently, a smaller but genuine increase in the incidence of autism may be occurring, likely due to the interplay between genetic susceptibility and a growing number of environmental and perinatal risk factors, such as increased parental age [1, 2, 4].

1.  **On RFK, Jr. on Autism** – *In My Tribe* (Substack). Author Arnold Kling argues that the primary explanation for the rise in autism is "diagnostic inflation," where the condition is more readily diagnosed due to broader criteria, greater awareness, and incentives tied to accessing services. He contends it is not a "true epidemic" caused by a single environmental factor. [[https://arnoldkling.substack.com/p/on-rfk-jr-on-autism](https://arnoldkling.substack.com/p/on-rfk-jr-on-autism)]

This article argues that while diagnostic changes play a role, they are insufficient to explain the entire increase, especially for severe cases of autism. It posits that a true increase in incidence has occurred and calls for more research into environmental causes.
