# What explains the rise in autism diagnoses?

The rise in diagnosed cases of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex phenomenon that researchers attribute to multiple interacting factors rather than a single cause. The scientific consensus indicates that a substantial portion of the increase is due to changes in diagnostic practices, increased awareness, and a better understanding of the condition [1, 4, 5]. However, some research also suggests a possible true increase in prevalence, linked to various genetic and environmental risk factors [2, 6, 8].

Key explanations for the rise in autism diagnoses include:

### 1. Broader Diagnostic Criteria and Increased Awareness
A primary driver of the increased prevalence is the evolution of how ASD is defined and diagnosed.

*   **Changes in Diagnostic Manuals**: The criteria for diagnosing autism have broadened over time. The transition from the DSM-IV to the DSM-5 in 2013, for instance, consolidated several distinct conditions (including Asperger's syndrome and Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified) into a single "autism spectrum disorder" diagnosis. This spectrum approach includes individuals with a wider range of symptoms and severity, including those without intellectual disability, who might not have been diagnosed in the past [13, 5].
*   **Greater Awareness**: Increased public, professional, and parental awareness has led to more children being screened and evaluated for ASD at earlier ages [11]. This heightened awareness means that more subtle cases, which might have been missed in previous decades, are now being identified [7].
*   **Diagnostic Substitution**: Many children who in the past might have been diagnosed with other conditions, such as "intellectual disability" or "language disorder," are now more accurately being diagnosed with autism. This shift does not necessarily mean more children have developmental disorders overall, but rather that they are being classified under a different and more appropriate diagnostic label [5]. A 2015 study in *JAMA Pediatrics* concluded that changes in reporting practices could account for as much as 60% of the increase in ASD prevalence [4].

### 2. A Potential True Increase from Environmental and Parental Factors
While diagnostic changes account for a large part of the statistical increase, some researchers and advocacy groups argue they cannot explain the entire trend, pointing to a potential true rise in the number of individuals with autism [2]. Research has identified several risk factors that are associated with a higher probability of ASD and have become more common in the population.

*   **Advanced Parental Age**: Multiple large-scale studies and meta-analyses have established a clear link between advanced parental age (both maternal and paternal) and an increased risk of having a child with ASD [9, 12]. As the average age of parents has risen in recent decades, this factor may contribute to a higher incidence of autism.
*   **Perinatal and Obstetric Factors**: Complications during pregnancy and birth are associated with a higher risk for ASD. For example, a meta-analysis in *Pediatrics* found that preterm infants have a significantly higher prevalence of ASD compared to infants born full-term [10]. Other factors like low birth weight are also considered risks [8].
*   **Other Environmental Exposures**: A comprehensive review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses identified strong evidence for risk associated with certain environmental factors, such as prenatal exposure to air pollution and pesticides, while noting that evidence for many other proposed factors is limited or inconsistent [8]. It is important to note that these factors are associated with increased *risk* and are not direct causes.

### 3. The Role of Genetics and Gene-Environment Interaction
Genetics play a fundamental role in autism.

*   **High Heritability**: ASD is known to be highly heritable. A major meta-analysis of twin studies estimated the heritability of ASD to be between 64% and 91%, indicating that a person's genetic makeup is the single largest factor in determining their likelihood of developing autism [3].
*   **Shifting Etiology**: While the underlying genetic predisposition is crucial, some research suggests that the relative importance of environmental factors may be growing. A 2020 study in *JAMA Psychiatry* analyzed millions of individuals over time and found that while heritability remained high, the proportion of autism's etiology attributable to environmental factors increased [6]. This may indicate that modern environmental pressures are interacting with genetic vulnerabilities in new ways.

In conclusion, the dramatic increase in autism diagnoses is not due to a single cause. It is primarily driven by a broader and more accurate diagnostic process, including changing criteria and heightened awareness. However, this does not rule out a concurrent true increase in the prevalence of ASD, potentially influenced by demographic shifts like advanced parental age and other environmental risk factors that interact with a strong underlying genetic predisposition [1, 2, 6].

    This opinion piece by economist Arnold Kling critiques simplistic explanations for the rise in autism, particularly those centered on vaccines or a single "toxin." Kling argues that while the "it's all better diagnosis" explanation is plausible, it may not be the complete picture, and the phenomenon is likely complex and multifactorial.

    This article argues strongly that the increase in autism prevalence is real and not just an artifact of "better diagnosing." The author contends that diagnostic changes cannot account for the sheer scale of the increase and that a genuine, biologically-driven "explosion" in cases is occurring.

    This scientific meta-analysis reviews multiple twin studies to determine the genetic influence on ASD. The authors conclude that autism is highly heritable, with genetics accounting for an estimated 64–91% of the risk, confirming that genetic factors are the most significant contributor to the etiology of ASD.
