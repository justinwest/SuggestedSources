# What explains the rise in autism diagnoses?

The dramatic rise in autism diagnoses over the past few decades is a complex phenomenon with no single cause. Researchers attribute the increase to a combination of factors, primarily revolving around changes in diagnostic practices and awareness, alongside a potential true increase in the incidence of autism linked to genetic and environmental risk factors [2, 4, 7].

### The Role of Diagnostic Changes and Awareness

A significant portion of the increase in autism prevalence is not due to more people having autism, but rather to more people being diagnosed. This is supported by multiple large-scale studies [2, 4, 11].

*   **Broadened Diagnostic Criteria**: The definition of autism has expanded over time. The introduction of the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV)* in 1994, and later the *DSM-5* in 2013, created a broader "autism spectrum disorder" (ASD) category. This new classification included milder forms of the condition, such as Asperger's syndrome (which was later subsumed into the ASD diagnosis), that would not have met the narrower criteria of previous manuals [2, 13].
*   **Increased Awareness and Screening**: Greater public and professional awareness has led to more children being screened, identified, and referred for evaluation at earlier ages [2, 7]. Federal laws mandating services for autistic children have also incentivized school districts and healthcare providers to identify cases more proactively [11].
*   **Diagnostic Substitution**: Many individuals who are now diagnosed with ASD might have previously been diagnosed with other conditions, such as "intellectual disability" or "language disorder." As diagnostic practices for autism improved, these cases were reclassified, shifting the numbers from one category to another without necessarily representing a new case of neurodevelopmental disorder in the population [2, 11].

A 2015 study published in *JAMA Pediatrics* found that these changes in reporting practices alone could account for approximately 60% of the increase in autism diagnoses observed in a Danish cohort between 2000 and 2010 [4].

### A Potential True Increase in Incidence

While diagnostic changes explain a large part of the trend, some researchers and advocacy organizations argue that they do not account for the entire "exponential explosion" and that a true rise in the number of people with autism has occurred [2]. This genuine increase is thought to be driven by the interplay between strong genetic predispositions and various environmental risk factors [3, 8].

*   **Genetic Predisposition**: Autism is highly heritable. A 2015 meta-analysis of twin studies estimated the heritability of ASD to be between 64% and 91%, indicating a strong genetic foundation [3]. While genes themselves have not changed, their interaction with a changing environment may contribute to a higher incidence.
*   **Environmental Risk Factors**: Research has identified several environmental factors that are consistently associated with an increased risk of ASD. These are not direct causes but risk factors that may trigger the underlying genetic vulnerability. The most well-established include:
    *   **Advanced Parental Age**: Both advanced paternal age and advanced maternal age are linked to a higher risk of having a child with autism [5, 8, 12].
    *   **Perinatal and Obstetric Factors**: Complications during pregnancy or birth, such as being born preterm or having a low birth weight, are associated with an increased prevalence of ASD [6, 8, 10].
    *   **Environmental Toxin Exposure**: The idea that environmental toxins, such as pesticides or chemicals in plastics, contribute to the rise in autism is a topic of ongoing research and public debate. Proponents like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. argue that toxins, particularly those in vaccines, are a primary cause [1]. However, a comprehensive 2017 evidence-based review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses found insufficient or inconsistent evidence for most purported environmental risk factors, including a definitive rejection of the link between vaccination and autism [8].

In conclusion, the rise in autism diagnoses is multi-faceted. The scientific consensus is that the majority of the increase can be attributed to non-etiological factors like a broader diagnostic definition, greater public awareness, and changes in how other developmental disorders are classified [2, 4]. However, a portion of the increase may reflect a true rise in incidence resulting from the complex interaction between high genetic heritability and established environmental risk factors like advanced parental age and birth complications [3, 8].
