# What explains the rise in autism diagnoses?

The rise in diagnosed cases of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex phenomenon without a single cause. Research indicates that the increase is a result of multiple, interacting factors, with significant debate about the relative contribution of each [1, 2]. The primary drivers of the increase are widely considered to be changes in diagnostic practices and increased awareness, though a genuine increase in the incidence of autism due to environmental and biological risk factors may also play a role [7, 8].

### Changes in Diagnostic Practices, Awareness, and Reporting

A substantial portion of the increase in autism prevalence can be attributed to how the disorder is identified, defined, and counted [4, 5].

*   **Broadening Diagnostic Criteria:** The definition of autism has expanded significantly over the decades. The introduction of the DSM-IV in 1994 and the later shift to the DSM-5 in 2013, which created a single "autism spectrum disorder" category, broadened the criteria and included individuals who previously might have received other diagnoses (such as intellectual disability or language disorder) or no diagnosis at all [5, 13]. Some commentators describe this as a "conceptual redefinition" where the label is applied more broadly than in the past [1].
*   **Increased Awareness and Screening:** Greater public and professional awareness has led to more children being screened and referred for evaluation at earlier ages [7, 11]. Pediatricians, educators, and parents are now more familiar with the signs of autism, leading to higher rates of identification.
*   **Changes in Reporting and Surveillance:** Methodological changes in how prevalence is measured have had a major impact. For example, a 2015 study in Denmark concluded that 65% of the observed increase in ASD diagnoses was attributable to changes in reporting practices, such as including individuals from outpatient registries for the first time [4]. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also improved its surveillance methods over time, leading to more complete data collection [7].

### A "True" Increase in Prevalence

While diagnostic and reporting changes are major factors, some researchers argue they do not account for the entire increase, suggesting a "true" rise in the number of people with autism [2, 11]. This perspective is supported by research identifying several biological and environmental risk factors that have become more common over time.

It is crucial to note that autism is highly heritable, with twin studies suggesting that genetic factors account for approximately 80% of the liability for developing ASD [3, 6]. The increase in prevalence is not due to rapid changes in human genetics, but rather to an increased prevalence of risk factors that may interact with a person's underlying genetic predisposition.

Key risk factors include:
*   **Advanced Parental Age:** A growing body of evidence shows that children of older parents are at an increased risk for autism. Meta-analyses have confirmed this association for both advanced paternal age [9] and advanced maternal age [12]. Average parental age has been rising for decades, which could contribute to a higher incidence of ASD [8].
*   **Perinatal and Obstetric Factors:** Advances in medical care have led to higher survival rates for preterm infants. Preterm birth is a significant risk factor, with a meta-analysis finding that the prevalence of ASD in preterm infants is approximately 7%, much higher than in the general population [10]. Other factors, such as maternal metabolic conditions like obesity and diabetes, are also associated with a modest increase in risk and have become more common [8].

In conclusion, the dramatic rise in autism diagnoses since the 1990s is multifaceted. The most well-documented explanations are non-etiological, including a broader diagnostic concept, greater public awareness, and more thorough data collection [4, 5, 11]. Concurrently, demographic shifts, such as increasing parental age and higher survival rates for preterm infants, likely contribute to a "true" increase in the number of children born with the condition [8, 9, 10, 12]. The precise balance between these factors remains a subject of ongoing scientific research and debate [2].

1.  **[On RFK, Jr. on Autism](https://arnoldkling.substack.com/p/on-rfk-jr-on-autism)**: This opinion piece by Arnold Kling argues that the rise in autism is best explained by a "conceptual redefinition." He suggests the label is now applied more broadly to individuals who would have previously been considered eccentric or simply different, rather than by a true epidemic caused by a single environmental toxin.
2.  **[Getting Real About Autism’s Exponential Explosion](https://www.ncsautism.org/blog//autism-explosion-2024)**: The National Council on Severe Autism argues that while diagnostic changes play a role, they do not fully explain the "exponential explosion" in cases, particularly severe autism. The organization calls for more research into environmental factors, suggesting a true increase in prevalence is occurring.
3.  **[Heritability of Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Meta-Analysis of Twin Studies](https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcpp.12499)**: This meta-analysis of twin studies concludes that autism spectrum disorder is highly heritable, with genetic factors accounting for an estimated 64–91% (pooled at ~80%) of the risk. This establishes the strong genetic foundation of the condition.
4.  **[Explaining the Increase in the Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders: The Proportion Attributable to Changes in Reporting Practices](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25365033/)**: This study of the Danish population found that 65% of the increase in diagnosed ASD cases over time could be statistically explained by changes in case reporting, specifically the inclusion of outpatient data.
5.  **[Diagnostic Change and the Increased Prevalence of Autism](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19737791/)**: This article posits that changes in diagnostic criteria are a major reason for the rise in prevalence. It suggests that many individuals now diagnosed with autism would have previously been diagnosed with other conditions or gone undiagnosed.
6.  **[Etiology of Autism Spectrum Disorders and Autistic Traits Over Time](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32374377/)**: This study of Swedish twins found that the heritability of ASD has remained high and stable over time. It suggests that changes in prevalence are more likely due to non-etiological factors like improved recognition and diagnostic practices rather than new causal factors.
7.  **[Data and Statistics on Autism Spectrum Disorder](https://www.cdc.gov/autism/data-research/index.html)**: The CDC provides official statistics on ASD prevalence (1 in 36 children in 2020) and states that the increase is likely due to a combination of factors, including better identification, increased awareness, and changes in diagnostic practices, in addition to potential risk factors.
8.  **[Environmental Risk Factors for Autism: An Evidence-Based Review of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28331572/)**: This review identifies several environmental factors with consistent evidence for increasing autism risk, including advanced parental age, maternal metabolic conditions (obesity, diabetes), and certain prenatal exposures, although the individual effect sizes are modest.
9.  **[Advancing Paternal Age and Autism](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16953005/)**: This study found a direct link between a father's age and the risk of autism in his offspring, showing that men aged 40 and older were significantly more likely to have a child with autism compared to men under 30.
